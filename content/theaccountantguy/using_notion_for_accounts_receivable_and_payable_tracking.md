The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker in [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | Notion]] is designed to help users track all customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Receivable and Payable Account Section

This section, located at the top of the tracker, features four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Accounts View
In the accounts view, you can set up details for your customers and vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This includes their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For example, two customers and one vendor might be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Quick action buttons on the left allow for easy addition of new vendors or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Clicking "Add vendor" or "Add customer" will create a new entry, which can then be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. After adding customer or vendor details, you can input the opening balance (the starting receivable or payable balance) and any pending invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Receivable Section
This section displays all receivable accounts with their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows customer details (e.g., Sandra, Harry) and all transactions carried out, such as invoices raised on specific dates (e.g., October 2nd, August 16th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Invoice Status:** You can change the status of an invoice (e.g., to indicate whether it's paid or outstanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Paid Checkbox:** Clicking a checkbox indicates an invoice has been paid, and the amount will no longer be calculated as outstanding at the top of the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Unchecking it recalculates the outstanding balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance:** For each customer, an outstanding amount is reflected at the top of their section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Payable Section
Similar to the receivable section, the payable section shows details of each transaction, including the date of the invoice, invoice number, status, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. A "paid" checkbox also helps in calculating outstanding vendor balances at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides an overall financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance, calculated from all recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Receivable Segment
Here, you can input detailed receivable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>:
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction.
*   **Period:** You can select one of four quarterly periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Description:** Details about the transaction.
*   **Account Name:** The customer name.
*   **Amount:** The transaction amount.
*   **Invoice Number:** The invoice identification number.
*   **Status of the Invoice:** The current status of the invoice.

Once these details are entered, they automatically update across the entire tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A "paid" column in the very first column indicates if an amount has been settled, preventing it from being included in total outstanding balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

A "receivable entry" quick action button allows for quickly adding new receivable entries, automatically populating with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Transactions are binned by month, with the latest month appearing on top, and a number indicates how many transactions occurred each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Segment
Similarly, the payable segment tracks vendor transactions with fields for date, period, description, account name, amount, invoice number, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A "payable entry" quick action button is available to add new payable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The quarterly summary provides a combined overview for all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

For instance, if the third quarter has receivables of $1150 (e.g., $150 + $1000) and payables of $250, the net balance would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The total amount across all quarters is also reflected at the top of this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | Notion]] tracker allows for adding new customer or vendor details, viewing summaries of receivable and payable accounts, and gaining a quick overview of overall financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

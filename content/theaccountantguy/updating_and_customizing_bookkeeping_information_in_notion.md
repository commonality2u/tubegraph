The template is designed to help keep track of all your [[bookkeeping_in_notion | bookkeeping]] needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The template is divided into three main sections:

*   **Summary**: Provides an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Transactions Window**: Where you enter all transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Customizing Initial Bookkeeping Setup (Start Here Section)

The "Start Here" section allows you to customize the fundamental accounts and settings for your business's [[bookkeeping_in_notion | bookkeeping]].

### Accounts Section

This section is where you manage different financial accounts grouped under main heads like Expenses, Liabilities, Income, and Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

#### Editing Existing Accounts
To modify an existing account, hover over the item and click the pencil icon that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After editing the details, click anywhere outside the details to save changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

#### Deleting Accounts
To remove an account, click on the three-dot menu next to the item and select the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

To add a new account, navigate to the relevant category (e.g., Expenses, Income) and click on "New page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This will open a new page where you can add the account's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Classification**: Categorize the item using options like "bills," "debt," or "savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For expenses, classifications such as "bills" for utility bills or "subscription" for subscriptions are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Define how often payments are made, such as monthly, half-yearly, or quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Specify the starting units for any inventory or assets when beginning the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Classify assets as either "Inventory" or "Investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Updating Bookkeeping Information (Transactions Window)

The "Transactions Window" is where you [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | track income and expenses in Notion]] and other financial activities by entering individual transactions.

### Adding New Transactions

Clicking "Add income," for example, automatically populates the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

#### Transaction Properties for Entry
When adding or updating a transaction, you can fill in the following details:
*   **Period**: Select or add the relevant month and year for the transaction (e.g., "October 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Description**: Provide a brief description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Category**: This is automatically mapped based on the "Add" button clicked (e.g., "income" for "Add income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Account**: Choose from the accounts you previously set up in the "Start Here" section. Accounts added in the "Start Here" section are reflected here automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The process for entering expense, asset, and liability transactions is similar to income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Tax Section**: Provides a quarterly breakdown of taxes payable, tax credits available, and overall tax liability, populated from income and expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Investment and Inventory Summaries

The Notion expense tracker template allows for [[customizing_expense_categories | customizing expense categories]] to fit specific use cases, such as tracking business expenses for construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Categories are typically defined at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Modifying Existing Categories
To edit an existing expense category within the template, click on the pencil icon associated with that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This allows users to redefine the category to suit their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Adding New Categories
A new expense category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This action will add a new category to the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Deleting Categories
To remove an expense category, click on the three-dot menu associated with the specific category and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This will delete the selected category from the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Adjusting Budgeted Expenses for Categories
For each category, a budgeted expense amount is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can adjust this budgeted amount by clicking on it directly and defining a new value based on their requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Actual expenses for each category are pulled from a table at the bottom of the template and update dynamically as values are modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This system provides a quick and easy way to track [[managing_business_expenses_in_notion | business expenses]] for projects like construction, all within a single Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For further [[customizing_the_notion_budget_template | customization]] needs, direct assistance is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

The Notion template for restaurant operations allows for [[using_notion_for_expense_management | tracking business expenses]] and [[expense_categorization_in_notion | categorizing them]] into different expense types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This template displays budgeted and actual expenses for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Modifying Existing Categories

To modify any of the existing expense categories in the Notion template, click on the pencil icon next to the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Once modified, the category will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This directly relates to [[how_to_define_and_modify_expense_categories | how to define and modify expense categories]].

## Adding New Categories

If you need to add a new expense category to your Notion tracker, click on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Deleting Categories

To remove an unwanted expense category, click on the three-dot icon next to the category and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The category will then be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Managing Budgeted Expenses per Category

For each expense category, you can define a budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To set or change a budgeted expense, click on the existing value for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The template also includes a percentage indicator showing the ratio of actual expenses incurred compared to the budgeted expense for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Dynamic Updates

All expense values in the template update dynamically as figures are inputted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures that the summary section, which displays total budgeted expense, actual expenses incurred, the difference, and the percentage of actual expenses, is always up-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

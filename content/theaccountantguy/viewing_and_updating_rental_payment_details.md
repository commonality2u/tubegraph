The [[notion_template_for_tracking_house_rent_payments | Notion template for tracking house rent payments]] allows users to [[tracking_rental_history_and_transaction_summaries | keep track of house rental payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system includes various sections for adding, viewing, and managing payment information.

## Setting Up Basic Information

To begin, users can add basic information through a summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Adding Properties**: Properties can be classified (e.g., apartment, duplex) and users can add any other property types as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Adding Tenants**:
    *   Click the "ADD tenant" button to create a new tenant entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   New tenants can be placed under their respective property categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   Tenant details are added by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

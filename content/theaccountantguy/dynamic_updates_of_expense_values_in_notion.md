A specialized Notion template for [[expense_tracking_using_notion | tracking business expenses]] in restaurant operations features dynamic updates of expense values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template allows users to monitor budgeted and actual expenses, with all figures updating automatically based on input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Expense Tracking Mechanism

The template displays three main categories of expenses at the top, showing both a budgeted amount and the actual expenses incurred for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The actual expense figures are automatically "pulled" from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Real-time Updates**
    Whenever new figures are entered into the expense table, all expense values displayed throughout the template update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures that the overview at the top immediately reflects the latest data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Budget vs. Actual Indication**
    For each expense category, a percentage indicator shows the proportion of actual expenses incurred relative to the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Dynamic Category Management

The template also supports dynamic management of expense categories:

*   **Modifying Categories**
    Existing expense categories can be modified by clicking a pencil icon, and the changes will automatically update across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This aligns with principles of [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | modifying and updating expense categories in Notion]].
*   **Adding New Categories**
    New categories can be added by clicking on "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**
    Categories can be deleted by clicking on the three-dot menu and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Summary Section Updates

A dedicated summary section provides an overview of the financial status, which also updates dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section includes:

*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Total actual expenses incurred, directly pulled from the table values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The overall percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The Notion Investment Portfolio tracker, developed by "the accountant guy" (Sad Biswal), is designed to help users track all their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It provides sections for portfolio overview and investment transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Investment Section

This section is where you initially set up your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Categories**: Investments are categorized into "stocks," "cryptos," and users can add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Examples include pre-added stocks and cryptos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Opening Details**: For each investment, users must input the opening balance and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Adding a New Investment

New investments can be quickly added using the "add investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
1.  Click the "add investment" button to create a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon to open a panel for details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
3.  Enter the investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
4.  Specify the opening balance (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
5.  Initially, new investments are "no classification"; they can be moved to "stocks," "crypto," or other categories by clicking the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Custom Categories

To add a new investment category:
1.  Click the plus icon next to the classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
2.  Create a new group, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. A new section for this category will be automatically added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Portfolio Section

The portfolio section displays the same investments but reflects their value and units *after* all transactions have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Investment Value & Units**: Shows the investment value and available units at the end of the financial year or post-transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Investment Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a specific investment relative to the total investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss**: Displays the total profit and loss for each investment after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A sum of profit or loss for each section is also available at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section tracks all investment-related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and offers four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>:

### All Transactions View
This view lists all buy and sell transactions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Data Entry**: For each transaction, users must enter the date, description, transaction type, investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), and the number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Calculated Fields**: The "price" field is calculated within the buy/sell sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, and the "amount" is derived by multiplying units by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Buy View
This view focuses specifically on investment purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Users fill in transaction information similar to the "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Entering the buy price automatically calculates the buy amount, as it is formula-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   A "Buy Investment" quick action button automatically adds a new line item with the current date, which can then be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Sell View
Similar to the buy view, this section is dedicated to sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   A "Sell Investment" quick action button creates a new line item under this view for recording sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Profit and Loss View
This view provides a detailed breakdown of profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   It includes the sales value and an additional "Buy price" information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   The profit or loss is calculated by taking the difference between the sell and buy price, multiplied by the units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. For example, selling 30 units of Apple stock at $40 each, which were bought at $10, generates a $900 profit (30 units * $30 difference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

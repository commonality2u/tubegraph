Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to set up bill payment reminders that are sent to WhatsApp using automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The system can display details such as the bill name, due date, and payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting Up Bill Payment Reminders

To [[creating_templates_for_automated_payment_notifications | create a new bill payment reminder]], follow these [[steps_for_configuring_reminder_notifications | steps]]:

1.  Click on the drop-down menu and select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Start by writing the name of your bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill amount, such as fifteen hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Go back to the previous screen, click the drop-down again, then click on the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
5.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For a mobile bill, you might choose "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
6.  Specify the exact time and date when you wish to receive the notification, for instance, 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
7.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the notification will repeat every month on the 20th at 11:55 AM and send a notification to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This process allows for [[customizing_recurring_payment_notifications | customizing recurring payment notifications]] and [[using_templates_for_recurring_bill_notifications | using templates for recurring bill notifications]].

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

This system relies on the help of [[automation_using_p_connect | automation using Pabbly Connect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation setup in Pabbly Connect is designed for this purpose, and a detailed explanation and guide are included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Once the automation is configured and a template is set on a recurring basis, notifications are automatically sent to WhatsApp every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## How It Works in Practice

The system demonstrates its functionality by automatically adding a new bill, as configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For example, if a bill is set to notify at 11:55 AM on the 20th of September, the system shows the new item being added around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

A "Mobile bill" might be added automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A WhatsApp notification will then be received, typically within a minute of the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. For instance, if the notification time was 11:55 AM, the message might arrive at 11:56 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This ensures timely reminders for every bill added and configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

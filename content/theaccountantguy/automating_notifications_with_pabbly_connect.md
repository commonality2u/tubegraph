This guide demonstrates how to set up [[setting_up_bills_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]] using a template system and [[using_p_connect_for_invoice_automation | Pabbly Connect]] for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system allows users to receive automatic notifications for recurring bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "[[using_templates_for_bill_notifications | new template]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the bill name, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, for example, $1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Setting Recurrence and Notification Time
After creating the bill template:
1.  Click the drop-down again and select the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For instance, a mobile bill can be set to recur "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
3.  Specify the exact time and day for receiving the notification, such as 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This setup ensures notifications are sent to WhatsApp monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

The system requires the help of [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases | automation]] via [[using_p_connect_for_invoice_automation | Pabbly Connect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases | automation]] workflow is configured within [[using_p_connect_for_invoice_automation | Pabbly Connect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide are included when downloading the [[using_p_connect_for_invoice_automation | Pabbly Connect]] template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once this [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases | automation]] is set up, notifications will be automatically sent to WhatsApp whenever a template is set on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Receiving Notifications

After the setup, new bills will be automatically added, and notifications will be sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For example, if a notification time is set for 11:55 AM on September 20th, the message will arrive around 11:56 AM, typically taking under a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This ensures timely reminders for all added recurring bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

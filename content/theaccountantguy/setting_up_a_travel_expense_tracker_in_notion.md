This article explains how to utilize a travel [[expense_tracking_in_notion | expense tracker]] within Notion to monitor your travel expenses and plan effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Template Overview: Summary Section

The travel expense tracker features a summary section that provides an overview of accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Accounts View

The accounts view allows you to set up different expense categories and their corresponding budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
Expenses are typically classified under categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

#### Adding and Managing Expense Sources

*   **Adding a New Expense Source:** Click the "add expense source" button to automatically add a new source under a travel category, which can then be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Editing Details:** Use the pencil icon to edit an expense source's details, such as changing its name (e.g., to "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts:** For each expense source, you can set a specific budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500 for Metro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Moving Categories:** Expense sources can be moved between different categories (e.g., moving an expense source to the "meals" section using a three-dot menu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Adding New Main Categories:** To create a completely new expense category or group, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Expenses View

This section displays the total expenses incurred, the budgeted amount for each expense, and the percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
For instance, if flight expenses are $2,000 against a $1,000 budget, it shows as 200%, indicating an overspend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
Over-budget expenses are typically indicated in red, while expenses within budget (e.g., $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget, showing 33%) are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The summary section provides a complete overview, including the total budgeted expense, total expense incurred, the difference between the two, and the overall percentage of budgeted expense spent (e.g., 59% spent if $3600 is incurred out of $6100 budgeted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Booking Travel Expenses

Expenses are classified under three main categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
Quick addition buttons are available for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Adding a New Expense

1.  **Select Category:** Choose the relevant category (e.g., "Travel") and click the corresponding "add travel expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This automatically adds a new expense entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  **Add Description:** Input a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
3.  **Enter Trip Info:** Specify the trip information (e.g., "trip to Paris"). This detail can be edited via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  **Select Account:** Choose the specific account for the expense, such as "train" for a travel expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  **Enter Amount:** Input the monetary value of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it will reflect in the expenses summary. If a budgeted amount is set for that expense (e.g., $200 for train), the tracker will show the percentage of the budget used (e.g., 50%) and indicate it in green if within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This template helps in understanding your spending and planning future expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

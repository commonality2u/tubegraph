This guide details how to utilize a [[using_notion_for_detailed_travel_expense_management | travel expense tracker]] within Notion to manage and plan travel-related expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system is designed by Anath Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker Structure

The tracker is divided into three main sections:
*   **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of accounts, expenses, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Accounts View**: Used to set up different expense categories and their [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeted amounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Expenses View**: Details total incurred expenses against budgeted amounts for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts (Categories and Budgets)

The initial step in [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] is to set up your expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under broad categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Adding Expense Sources

To add a new specific expense source (e.g., Metro, Train), click the "Add Expense Source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This automatically adds a new source to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Editing Expense Source Details

After adding, click the pencil icon next to the new expense source to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Here, you can:
*   **Rename the source**: For example, change "Expense Source" to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Set the budgeted amount**: Input the expected cost, for instance, $1,500 for Metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Moving Expense Sources Between Categories

If an expense source needs to be moved to a different category (e.g., from Travel to Meals), click the three dots next to the expense source and drag it to the desired section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. You can also edit details directly after moving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Adding New Categories or Editing Existing Ones

*   **Adding a new category**: Click the plus sign on the right side of the Accounts view to create an entirely new group, separate from the existing Travel, Meals, and Lodging categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Editing an existing category**: Click on the existing group name (e.g., "Travel") to start editing its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Understanding the Expenses Summary

The "Expenses" section provides a detailed view of each expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For each expense source, it displays:
*   The total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   The [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeted expense]] set for that source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

For example, if a flight expense is $2,000 against a budgeted $1,000, it will show 200% and be highlighted in red, indicating that the budget has been exceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Conversely, a breakfast expense of $100 against a $300 budget will show 33% and be in green, indicating it's within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This provides a quick visual overview of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary Section

The "Summary" section offers a complete overview of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It shows:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   An overall percentage, which is the total expenses divided by the total budgeted expense, indicating how much of the overall budget has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For instance, 59% suggests 59% of the total budget has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Booking Travel Expenses

Expenses are classified under the same three categories as in the Accounts view: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Adding an Expense Entry

Use the quick addition buttons (e.g., "Add Travel Expense") to add a new expense under the relevant category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A new entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Entering Expense Details

For each new expense entry, you can input the following details:
*   **Description**: A brief note about the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Trip Info**: Details about the trip this expense relates to (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Account of the Expense**: Select the specific expense source from the pre-defined accounts (e.g., Train, Bus, Metro, Flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it immediately updates the "Expenses" summary, reflecting the incurred amount and percentage against its budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If no [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeted amount]] is set for a specific expense source, it will not reflect ideal values until a budget is assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | expense tracker]] template helps users understand their spending and effectively plan their [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

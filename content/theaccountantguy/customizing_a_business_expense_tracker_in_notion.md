A Business Expense Tracker in Notion is designed to help businesses keep track of all their expenses under a single General Ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tracker offers sections for defining expense categories, an overview of spending, and a transaction entry system, all contributing to effective [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Expense Categories

This section allows users to define the different types of expenses a business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The tracker comes with some predefined categories, but these can be fully customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Customizing Categories

*   **Modifying Existing Categories**: Users can click directly on a category name to modify or change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories**: To change a subcategory, simply click on the pencil icon associated with it and edit the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A "new" button allows users to add entirely new categories of their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts

For each expense category, a budgeted amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[budgeting_business_expenses_using_notion | budgeting business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any changes made to these budgeted amounts will automatically reflect in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, changing a budget for "advertising" from $100 to $5,000 will instantly update the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   Budgeted expenses set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   A percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if spending remains within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

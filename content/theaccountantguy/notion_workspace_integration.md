Wizzygen is a platform designed to assist in creating AI-generated content directly within a Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers two primary methods for content generation: through a Notion database or a Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Content Generation on Notion Pages

A Notion page is a simple, blank page created within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. To generate AI content on a Notion page using Wizzygen:
1.  Name the connection being built, for example, "notion page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Select "notion page" as the content type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  Copy the URL of the specific Notion page where content is to be generated and paste it into the URL section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  Click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
5.  Input the desired AI prompt, such as "write me a block of 100 words on Notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
6.  Once the prompt is entered, the AI will generate and populate the content directly onto the specified Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Content Generation on Notion Databases

A Notion database is structured in rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Wizzygen can populate AI-generated content into specific fields or rows within a database. The process for generating content on a Notion database is similar to that for a page:
1.  Name the connection, for example, "notion database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
2.  Select "notion database" as the content type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the desired Notion database, copy its URL, and paste it into the Wizzygen URL section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This process is part of [[setting_up_the_wizzygen_connections_database_in_notion | setting up the Wizzygen connections database in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  Click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
5.  Provide a prompt, such as "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This prompt will instruct the AI to generate content for each row based on its respective topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
6.  The AI will then generate and populate the content into the blank fields of the database, with each row being captured and content generated accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

This article details the process of [[generating_boarding_pass_pdfs_using_notion | generating boarding pass PDF documents]] using Notion, leveraging a dedicated database and a [[creating_and_using_notion_templates_for_pdfs | boarding pass template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Components Needed

To generate boarding pass PDFs, you will need:
*   A **boarding pass database** that contains a list of all the necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A [[creating_and_using_notion_templates_for_pdfs | **boarding pass template**]] from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Generation Process

1.  **Initiate PDF Output**: Begin by typing "boarding pass" into the connection details for the PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database**: Select and connect the "boarding pass database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Select Template**: Choose the [[creating_and_using_notion_templates_for_pdfs | boarding pass template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: The system will then load all information from both the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once the information is loaded, click "export" to start generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Outcome

Upon successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   You can preview a sample to verify that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The generated files can be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Multiple PDF outputs can be generated, each with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This method allows for efficient [[generating_boarding_pass_pdfs_using_notion | generation of PDF documents]] using Notion's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

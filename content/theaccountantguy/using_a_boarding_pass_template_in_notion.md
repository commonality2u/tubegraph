Notion can be utilized to [[generating_boarding_pass_pdfs_using_notion | generate boarding pass PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This process involves connecting a dedicated database with a pre-designed template to output customized PDF files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To generate boarding pass PDFs, you need two main components in Notion:
*   A **boarding pass database** containing all the necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   A **boarding pass template** from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Generating PDF Documents

The process for generating boarding pass PDFs using [[using_pdf_output_templates_in_notion | Notion's PDF output feature]] involves several steps:

1.  **Initiate PDF Output**: Begin by typing "boarding pass" into the connection details for the PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database**: Select the "boarding pass database" to connect the data source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  **Select Template**: Choose the "boarding pass template" that will be used for the PDF layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: After selecting the template, the system will begin loading all information from the database and the chosen template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once all information is loaded, initiate the export process to generate the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Post-Generation

After the export is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   **Preview Sample**: You can preview a sample to ensure the boarding pass has been generated correctly with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Download Files**: The generated PDF files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These files can include multiple PDFs, each with different names and contexts, as seen in an example where three separate files were generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This method allows for efficient generation of PDF documents directly from Notion databases and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

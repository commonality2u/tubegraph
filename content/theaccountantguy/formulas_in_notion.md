This article details how to [[using_formulas_in_notion | use formulas in Notion]] to find the difference between two numbers within a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two methods will be discussed: using the subtract operator and using the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Creating a Database
To begin, create a database by typing a forward slash and selecting "database" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The first property in the database should be a title property, which indicates the purpose of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Assign number properties to two different columns where the numbers will be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Finding the Difference
Two different formulas can be used to find the difference between two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Using the Subtract Operator
A formula utilizing the subtract operator can be used to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if "Number 1" and "Number 2" are provided as inputs, the formula will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign
Similarly, a minus sign (`-`) can be used directly in a formula to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Using either of these methods allows for calculating the difference between two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

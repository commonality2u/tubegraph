This Notion template is designed to track house rental payments and manage related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Summary Section Overview

The template features a summary section with four primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

1.  **Basic Information Addition**: This view allows for the addition of tenants and the classification of properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   **Property Classification**: Properties can be classified under different types, such as "apartment" and "duplex", with the option to add other classifications as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   **Tenant Management**: Tenants can be added by clicking an "ADD tenant" button, which automatically creates a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New tenant entries can then be moved to their respective property [[defining_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] and details can be added by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
2.  **Property Section**: This section displays different property classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Underneath each property, you can view:
    *   The name of the tenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   The total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
    *   The rent amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   The balance rent amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   Any advanced rent that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Rental History**: This view shows the rental history for all tenants who have made payments, based on the [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] booked at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
4.  **Overall Summary**: This final summary section provides an overview of the total amount due, the amount paid, outstanding rent, and the percentage of rent collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] section offers three distinct views in addition to a view showing all [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

*   **Rent Paid**: Displays all [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] for which rent has been paid, along with the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Rent Due**: Shows information for rent that is due and has not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Checking a box in this view will move the rent entry to the "Rent Paid" [[defining_expense_categories_in_notion | category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Summary**: Provides a quarterly breakdown of rental payments, collections, and the balance due for every month within each respective quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

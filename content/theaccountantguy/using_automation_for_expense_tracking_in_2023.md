This guide demonstrates a method for [[tracking income and expenses effectively | effectively tracking]] and managing recurring subscription payments by setting up automated reminders directly on WhatsApp. This system utilizes a Notion database to ensure timely payment notifications [00:00:05].

## Setting Up Subscription Payment Reminders

To set up a subscription payment reminder within the Notion database:

1.  **Create a New Template**: Click the dropdown menu and select the option to create a new template [00:00:23]. This action provides an option for "setting up the subscription reminder alert" [00:00:28].
2.  **Enter Subscription Details**: Specify the name of the subscription (e.g., Spotify) and its corresponding amount (e.g., $150) [00:00:32]. Confirm by clicking "background" [00:00:41]. A new template will be added to the database [00:00:43].
3.  **Configure Repetition**:
    *   Click on the three dots next to the newly added subscription [00:00:48].
    *   Select "repeat" [00:00:50].
    *   Choose the desired repetition mode, such as "every month" [00:00:52]. This ensures the subscription payment of the specified amount (e.g., $150) is repeated each month [00:01:00].
    *   A new window will appear, allowing you to specify the exact time and start date for the reminder [00:01:11]. For example, a reminder can be set for 11:56 AM on the 23rd of every month [00:01:20].
    *   Click "Save" [00:01:38]. A repetition arrow will indicate that the reminder is set to automatically repeat monthly [00:01:40].

Once configured, the system will automatically add a new line item in the Notion database at the specified time and date each month [00:01:52].

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Following the line item addition in Notion, an automatic notification alert will be sent to WhatsApp [00:02:01].

*   The notification will include a payment reminder for the subscription and its amount (e.g., "payment reminder of 45 150 for Spotify") [00:02:13].
*   These notifications will recur monthly on the set date [00:02:24].
*   The WhatsApp message also includes a "pay now" link, allowing for direct payment of the subscription amount [00:02:31].
*   The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is fully customizable to meet individual requirements [00:03:00]. The template download includes instructions for setting up this automation and customization [00:03:12].

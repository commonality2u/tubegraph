This article explains how to utilize a business budget template to [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | keep track of budgeting for a business]], specifically focusing on operational, administrative, and marketing expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template features a business expenses summary at the top, divided into three main sections: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section

In the Account section, users can set up different head of expenses under operational, administration, or marketing categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   To add a new category, scroll to the right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Budgeted amounts can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The Expenses section allows users to view current expenses in comparison to budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This section automatically updates as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   The difference between both amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that was set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is used for [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | booking expenses]] under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Currently, under the operational category, expenses are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Adding Expenses

To quickly [[adding_and_managing_expenses | add an expense]]:

*   Clicking a button will add an expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Users can then add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Associate the expense with relevant accounts added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   A "quick button" at the top allows [[adding_and_managing_expenses | adding a different expense]] under each head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   A "new" icon can quickly [[adding_and_managing_expenses | add an expense]] under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, clicking "new" under the operation category allows inputting details and budgeted amounts for a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

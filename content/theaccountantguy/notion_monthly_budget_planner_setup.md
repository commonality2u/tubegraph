### Expenses Overview

This view details specific expense categories such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether you have exceeded or are under your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview

This view presents all your expenses in a monthly format, with months categorized for easy viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Yearly Overview

Similar to the monthly overview, this view displays the same information but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Summary

The summary section provides a complete annual expense overview, consolidating all expenses to give insight into your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For general information on tracking expenses, refer to [[notion_expense_tracker_overview | Notion expense tracker overview]].

## Utilizing the Expense Details Database

To use the planner, you will enter all your financial information into the `expense details database` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database automatically calculates and populates all the expense views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

Transactions in the expense details database are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, so the latest month appears at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click the "new" button within the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Enter the date**: For example, "February 1, 2024". The system automatically adjusts the month based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  **Enter the expense detail**: This is the description of the expense, such as "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  **Select the period**: Choose the corresponding month and year, for example, "Feb 2024". You can also add new periods if they are not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
5.  **Select the year**: Choose the relevant year, such as "2024 year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  **Select the category**: Choose the type of expense from pre-defined categories (e.g., Utilities, Food, Shopping, Entertainment). You have the option to add your own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  **Enter the expense code**: This code helps segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  **Enter the expense amount**: Input the actual amount spent in the `expense amount` column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Setting a Budget

The `budget amount` column is used at the beginning of the month to set a budget for a specific expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

To set a budget for a specific expense:
1.  Select the date, typically the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the `expense name` (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the `period` (e.g., February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the `year` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Select the `category` (e.g., "Food"). For budget entries, the `expense name` and `category name` should typically be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
6.  Set the `expense code` (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  Enter the budgeted amount in the `budget amount` column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once you enter the budget, the figures in the main overview sections will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. As you continue to add expense information, all the top views will automatically update, providing more information on your monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Your Finances

After booking all your expenses, you can extract various insights from the planner:
*   **By Period**: Clicking on a specific `period` (e.g., "Feb 2024") will open a new window showing all transactions for that period, including amounts and whether they were budget or actual expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **By Year**: Clicking on the `year` will show a similar view, detailing budgeted amounts, expenses, expense as a percentage, and the budget status for the entire year, along with all yearly transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **By Category**: You can view how much expense has been booked for a particular `category`, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, expense as a percentage, and status. It also shows a list of all transactions related to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **By Expense Code**: The `expense code` allows you to see how much has been booked for a specific category within a particular month, in comparison to its total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This system helps you track your finances through its four different views and gain valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. For general budgeting and saving tips, check out [[budgeting_and_saving_with_notion | Budgeting and Saving with Notion]].

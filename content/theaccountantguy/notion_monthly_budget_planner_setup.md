This guide outlines how to set up and utilize a [[creating_a_minimalistic_budget_planner_using_notion | Notion]] monthly budget planner to manage finances for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The planner, introduced by An Biswal, "the accountant guy," helps users track their spending and compare it against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Overview of the Planner Views

The [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | Notion budget tracker template]] features four primary views to help visualize financial data:

*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>: This view provides a summary for different expense categories such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: All expenses are categorized by month, allowing for a quick glance at spending patterns within each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: Similar to the monthly view, this provides the same information but presented in an annual format, aiding in [[using_notion_for_yearly_financial_overview | yearly financial overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: This section offers a comprehensive expense overlook in a yearly format, grouping all expenses to give an overall performance summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To begin [[notion_expense_tracker_setup | tracking expenses]], users interact with the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. All expenses are categorized into months, sorted in descending order so that the latest month appears at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click on the "New" button in the expense details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The month will automatically adjust based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  Select the "Period" (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the "Year" (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the "Category" of expense (e.g., "Utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  Add an "Expense Code," which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the "Expense Amount" in the corresponding column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Setting a Budget

At the beginning of each month, users can set a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
1.  Select the date (e.g., the first day of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the "Period" and "Year," similar to entering an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Choose the "Category" (e.g., "Food"). The expense name and category name should remain the same for budget entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
5.  Set the "Expense Code" as the category followed by the month and year (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  Input the budgeted amount in the "Budget Amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Setting a budget automatically updates the figures in the main overview sections for the respective months and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Finances

After booking expenses, users can analyze their financial situation through various interactions within the planner, supporting [[budget_management_with_notion | budget management with Notion]] and [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | personal finance management]]:

*   **Period Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including details like amounts and whether they were budget or expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Year Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>: Clicking on a year provides a similar view, showing the budgeted amount, expense amount, expense as a percentage, and the budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>: Users can view how much has been spent for a particular category, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status, along with related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Expense Code Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: This allows users to see booked amounts for a specific category and month, compared to the total budget for that combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

It covers using a sales receipt tracker template, likely within Notion, and a dedicated online tool called PDF Output.com for single and [[generating_payment_receipts_pdf_in_bulk | bulk PDF generation]].

## Sales Receipts Tracker Template

A sales receipts tracker template allows users to keep track of sales information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It typically features a database to store all relevant sales data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Key Database Fields

The sales receipts database includes fields crucial for tracking sales:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method**: Offers several options for clearing payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Business Name and Address**: Users can input their own business details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Customer Details**: A relational property linked to another database containing client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Description**: Details what is being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Quantity of Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

For each row, multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale, allowing for various items sold within one receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Financial Calculations and Summaries

The template automatically computes financial data:
*   **Subtotal Column**: Sums the total amount of individual items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate**: Applied to the subtotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Total Amount**: Automatically calculated based on subtotal and tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Notes Column**: For any related notes regarding payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Additional columns may be linked to other databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary

A summary section provides an overview of sales performance:
*   **Total Sales**: Drawn from the sales value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units Sold**: Based on the quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Formulas for subtotal and total amount may need updating if more description or quantity columns are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Average Sales Value**: Calculated by dividing total sales by units sold, providing key performance indicator (KPI) information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Client Summary

A client summary breaks down sales by customer:
*   **Total Sales for Each Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   **Total Quantity of Sales** made to each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   **Average Sales Price** for every client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>

The Notion Net Worth Tracker, developed by Sanat Biswal (The Accountant Guy), helps individuals, freelancers, and small business owners [[managing_finances_using_notion | manage their finances using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This tracker specifically enables users to track their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and set specific financial goals.

## Net Worth Goal Section

One of the primary financial goals you can set in this Notion template is your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This goal is specified in the "Get Started" section of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### How to Set Your Net Worth Goal

1.  Navigate to the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Net Worth Goal" entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
3.  Click on the displayed amount (e.g., "$10,000") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
4.  Edit the value to your desired net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For example, you can change it to $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> or $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
5.  Upon changing this value, the entire database automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Tracking Progress Towards Your Goal

The "Summary" section of the tracker provides an overview of your financial performance, including your net worth progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Under the "Net Worth" view, you can find several statistical figures related to your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>:

*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target you initially set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between your Net Worth Goal and your Total Net Worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The increase in your net worth from the opening balance to the current closing net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal you have accomplished, expressed as a percentage of your total net worth relative to your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

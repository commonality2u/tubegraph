This guide outlines how to utilize a business budget template to effectively track and manage business expenses, with a focus on [[setting_and_managing_business_expense_categories_in_notion | setting up and managing expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The template is designed to help businesses stay within their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template begins with a "Business Expenses Summary" at the top, divided into three key sections: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section: Setting Up Expense Categories

In the Account section, users can [[customizing_categories_for_expense_tracking | set up different heads of expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
Common pre-defined categories include:
*   Operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

#### Adding and Editing Categories
*   **Adding a New Category**: To add a new category, scroll to the right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: To edit an existing category, click on any of the current categories and begin editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Once categories are set up, a budgeted amount can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Expenses Section: Tracking Against Budget

The Expenses section provides a view of current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section: Overall Financial Picture

The Summary section provides an overview, reflecting:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   The percentage of budgeted expense set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Transaction Section: Booking Expenses

The transaction section at the bottom allows users to book expenses under each of the different heads of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Expenses
*   **Quick Add Buttons**: Users can quickly add an expense using the buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For instance, clicking the "operational expense" button will add an expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Adding Details**: After adding an expense, users can input a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, associate the expense to relevant accounts previously added at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, and enter the desired amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Changing Dates**: If an expense was added on an incorrect date, it can be changed by clicking on the date and selecting the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The system will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Accounts
A quick button at the top, labeled "adding an expense source," allows for adding a new expense under an existing head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Alternatively, the "new" icon can be used to quickly [[adding_and_managing_expense_sources | add an expense]] under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, to add a new account under the operational category, click the "new" button, enter the details, and set the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

This comprehensive approach helps in [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customizing expense categories and budgeting in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, ensuring all expenses are tracked and kept within the required budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

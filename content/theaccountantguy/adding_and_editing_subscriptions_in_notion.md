## Subscription Overview Section

The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

    *   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   The percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Quick Action for Adding Subscriptions

A quick action button allows you to "add subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Clicking this button automatically adds a new subscription, which initially appears under a "note subscription" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Moving Subscriptions**: You can move it to any classification of your choice by clicking the three dots and selecting a category (e.g., "active mode") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Editing Subscription Details**: Use the pencil icon to edit the details of the newly added subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction" section is where you [[entering_transactions_in_notion | feed]] all the details to book subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Views**:
    *   "Active Subscriptions" view: Shows all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   "Cancel Subscription" view: Shows canceled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Monthly Bifurcation**: Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each month is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Entering Subscription Transaction Details

To enter details for a subscription:

1.  **Status**: Click the checkbox to mark the subscription as currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: Select the subscription account from a list pulled from all subscriptions added in the top section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the billing period set at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Choose the payment date for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Input the amount of the subscription expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
6.  **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the payment date and the set billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

    *   For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period will show an October 30 renewal date, calculating exactly a month from the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### [[viewing_and_canceling_subscriptions_in_notion | Canceling a Subscription]]

To cancel a subscription, simply click the checkbox next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This will automatically change its status to "cancel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, which is reflected in both the transaction section and the overview section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Quick Add Subscription Transaction

You can quickly add a subscription transaction by clicking the "space subscription" button, allowing you to quickly input all details as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

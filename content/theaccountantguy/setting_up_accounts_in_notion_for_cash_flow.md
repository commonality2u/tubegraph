This guide provides an overview of how to utilize a Notion template to [[using_notion_for_financial_management | track business cash flow]], focusing specifically on setting up and managing accounts within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The template is designed to help users track cash inflow and outflow, providing a clear financial picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The cash flow template includes a summary section on the left, displaying the opening cash balance, total cash inflow, total cash outflow from transactions, and the closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These balances update automatically as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Account Section

On the right side of the template, three main sections are visible: "Account section," "Quarterly overview," and "Business activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The "Account section" is where you set up and manage different financial accounts under various categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This is crucial for [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | managing accounts and transactions in Notion]].

### Managing Account Categories

You can customize the accounts within the template based on your business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Assets:** Default asset categories include cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. You can add new assets or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Liabilities, Income, and Expenses:** The same principles for adding and editing items apply to these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

#### Adding and Editing Accounts

To edit an existing asset, click the pencil icon next to it and enter the preferred name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. To add a completely new item under any category, click the "New" button within that respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Account Properties

When setting up or editing an account, several properties can be defined:

*   **Opening Balance:** This is the starting balance of the asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Classifications:** These define how a specific item is categorized, e.g., a credit card as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. You can add new classifications or edit existing ones by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency:** Useful for income and expenses, this specifies how frequently payments are received or made for a particular item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, interest income might have a quarterly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Opening Units:** This is relevant for investments or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For example, an inventory item might have 10 opening units with an opening balance of $1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** This is relevant only for inventory or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Inventory items can be put under the "inventory asset class," and investments under the "investment asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

Once accounts are assigned, you can begin [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | adding transactions]] to track cash flow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The template offers different views for transactions, including Income, Expense, Asset, Liability, Investments, and Inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

To add an income transaction, for example, click "Add Income" on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. You can then specify the date, period (e.g., "January 2024"), description, and select the relevant account (e.g., "Sales Revenue") from the accounts you set up earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. You also select the payment mode (cash or bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, and cash activity type (operating, investing, or financing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The transaction type (inflow or outflow) is crucial for accurate cash flow tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

All data entered into transactions automatically updates the cash flow overview and business activity sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For example, if you change an income amount, the total cash inflow updates accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. If figures are slow to update, simply click on the sum/balance options to refresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

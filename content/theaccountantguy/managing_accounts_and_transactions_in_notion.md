This article focuses on how to use the Notion Net Worth Tracker to manage accounts and transactions.

## Net Worth Tracker Overview

The Net Worth Tracker template in Notion is structured into three main sections to help [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | calculate your personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> and track net worth:
*   **Get Started Section** This is where users specify their net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Account Section** Users can specify all accounts for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, including expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** This section provides an [[viewing_summary_of_transactions_in_notion | entire finances overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, displaying accounts with corresponding closing balances and their proportion of the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It also includes a net worth section that shows the net worth goal, total net worth calculation, the difference, growth, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Transactions View** This section allows users to feed in all income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities, which contributes to the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts

To begin, users need to [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_accounts_in_notion | set up accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal
The first step is to set a net worth goal in the "Net Worth Goal" view under the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This value can be edited at any time, and the database automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
To add a new account, scroll down within the "Account" section and click the "New" button displayed under each category (Income, Expense, Asset, Liability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When adding an account, fill in the following details:
*   **Name**: For example, "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: This is the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance, but asset and liability accounts can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Classification**: A tag to associate with the account, such as "bills" for groceries or "subscription" for Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Users can add new categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: How frequently the payment is expected (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Users can also set custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Used for [[tracking_investment_transactions_in_notion | investments]] to specify the starting number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Used for [[managing_asset_financials_in_notion | investments]] to classify them as "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This field should be left blank for other account types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Examples of Accounts

## Tracking Transactions

The [[how_to_add_and_track_transactions_in_notion | transactions view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> has four specific views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Summary and Net Worth Calculation

After entering all transactions and accounts, the "Summary" section computes the net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Finances View
This view shows all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities as of the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Net Worth View
This view provides five key statistical figures:
*   **Net Worth Goal**: The goal set earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: The difference between total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between the net worth goal and the total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The closing net worth value less the opening net worth, representing growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Opening net worth is derived from the opening balances specified for assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: The ratio of total net worth to the net worth goal, indicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, the net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

This article explains how to manage accounts and transactions within a Notion-based net worth tracker, designed to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners [[managing_finances_with_notion | manage their finances using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The tracker is a template available from "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker

The net worth tracker template features three main sections:
1.  **Get Started** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>: Where you specify your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Account Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>: Allows you to specify different accounts for personal finances, categorised as expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>: Provides an overview of your entire finances, displaying closing balances and proportions of each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This section also includes a net worth view, showing the net worth goal, total net worth calculation, difference, growth, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Finally, a **Transactions View** allows you to [[entering_transactions_in_notion | feed in all income and expenses]], along with details related to assets and liabilities, which helps in [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | calculating net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts in Notion

To begin, you first need to [[setting_up_accounts_in_notion | set up your accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal
Under the "Get Started" view, you can set your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This value automatically updates other database elements when changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For example, you can change the default $10,000 to $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
In the account section, you can add new accounts under each category (income, expense, assets, liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

To add a new income account:
1.  Scroll down to the income category and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
2.  A pop-up will appear for filling in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
3.  **Name**: Enter the name of the income, e.g., "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
4.  **Opening Balance**: Leave blank for income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This field is primarily for assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
5.  **Classification**: Assign a tag to the account, such as "other income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add new categories or use existing ones (e.g., "Bills," "Subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
6.  **Payment Frequency**: Specify how often you receive the income (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can add custom frequencies or use predefined options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
7.  **Opening Units** and **Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for investments and should be left blank for income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Managing Assets and Liabilities
*   **Assets**: For investments like Bitcoin, you can specify an opening balance (e.g., $100) and opening units (e.g., 10 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The asset class for investments should be set to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. For savings, the classification might be "savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: You can add debt payments and loans, setting their payment frequency as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

All accounts are customizable and can be edited anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. To edit an existing account, click on the pencil icon, which opens an edit window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Entering Transactions in Notion

The transaction section allows you to [[entering_transactions_in_notion | set up all financial transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. There are four different views: income, expense, asset, and liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. These views are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

To enter a specific transaction:
1.  Click the "New" button in the relevant view (e.g., Income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Select the transaction date; it automatically classifies the transaction into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Description**: Add a description, e.g., "Salary income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **Category**: This will automatically populate based on the view (e.g., Income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
5.  **Account**: Select the specific account you created earlier (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
6.  **Payment Mode**: Choose how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank account" for income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
7.  **Transaction Type**: This is crucial for [[tracking_expenses_and_income_in_notion | tracking money flow]]:
    *   **Inflow**: For income transactions or when you obtain more loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Also for selling assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: For expense transactions or loan repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Also for putting money into a specific asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
8.  **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount, e.g., $1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
9.  **Document**: Attach any receipts or bills by embedding a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Summary and Net Worth Calculation

After [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | adding all transactions]] and accounts, the final step is the calculation of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Finances Overview
The "Finances" view under the summary shows all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities as of the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This provides a complete overview of your finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Net Worth View
The "Net Worth" view presents five key statistical figures:
1.  **Net Worth Goal**: The goal you set earlier (e.g., $14,000, which can be adjusted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Changing this value updates calculations below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. For example, $6950 (assets) minus $1600 (liabilities) equals $5350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The gap between your net worth goal and your total net worth (e.g., $12,000 goal - $5350 total = $6650 difference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: The closing net worth value minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities specified in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your goal you have accomplished (e.g., $5350 total net worth / $12,000 goal = 45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As you continue [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | adding transactions and dealing with different items]], your net worth will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Features

The Notion tracker offers several customization options:

*   **Currency Change**: Notion supports changing the currency to over 30 different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Detailed instructions for this are available within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Changing Dashboard View**: You can alter the layout of your dashboard. For instance, the "other finances" view can be changed from a board view to a gallery view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. You can also group items by category (e.g., assets, expenses, income, liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Notion provides significant flexibility for view customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Device Support**: The tracker supports all types of devices and operating systems, including iOS and Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

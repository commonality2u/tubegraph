## Workflow for Using the Template

To utilize this template effectively, begin by [[using_databases_for_financial_tracking_in_notion | setting up accounts]] under different heads in the "Start Here" section and add any relevant opening balances for assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

This process automatically updates all summary information at the top, allowing for an immediate overview of business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This method simplifies [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]] and provides a complete financial picture of your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

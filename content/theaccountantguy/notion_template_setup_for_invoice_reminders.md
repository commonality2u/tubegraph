This article details how to use a Notion template to automate invoice payment reminders for customers, leveraging [[notion_templates_and_automation_features | Notion's template]] and automation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This setup helps in [[automating_invoice_payment_reminders_using_notion | automating invoice payment reminders using Notion]] for efficient financial management.

## Invoice Reminder Template Columns

The template used for this automation includes several columns to manage invoice information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Customer Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Email** of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Invoice Details** to specify related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Invoice Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Invoice Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   **Status** of the invoice:
    *   "Paid" indicates payment has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
    *   "Due" indicates payment is still pending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Due Date** of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

## Automated Reminder Message Example

The automated reminder message is customizable and pulls specific data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. An example message includes:
*   Sender Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Subject Line: "Invoice [Invoice Number] is due soon and action is required" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Customer Email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Body:
    *   Greeting with Customer Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Reminder of Invoice Number and Due Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Detailed invoice information: Invoice Number, service description (Invoice Details), Due Date, and Total Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   The invoice amount can be set to any preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Payment options (bank account details, Swift Code) can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   An attached invoice PDF, e.g., "Invoice 3.pdf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

5.  **Schedule the Trigger**: Configure the automation to trigger daily, checking the database for invoices with a "Due" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The time of day for this trigger can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
6.  **Connect Notion Database**: Link the Notion database (e.g., "DB - Invoice Payment Reminder") to Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Update the connection and allow Pabbly Connect access to your Notion workspace and the specific template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   Disable "Simple Response" before saving and sending a test request to capture all data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

This article details how to [[using_notion_for_expense_management | utilize a Notion monthly budget planner]] for [[organizing_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | organizing and categorizing expenses]], and [[tracking expenses and income in Notion | tracking transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system allows users to budget for each month and monitor their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four primary views to help manage finances:
*   **Expenses Overview** Displays total expense amounts, budgeted amounts, percentage of budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget for predefined categories like shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** Presents all expenses in a monthly format, categorizing months and showing expenses at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Shows the same information as the monthly overview but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Provides a complete expense overview in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to give a comprehensive view of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | Entering Transactions]]

All expense information is entered into the "Expense Details" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, meaning the latest month appears at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The system automatically adjusts for the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the expense [[creating_and_managing_categories_in_notion | category]] (e.g., "utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can add [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | custom categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  Add an "expense code" to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the "expense amount" in the designated column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This column is for recording the actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## [[setting_up_income_and_expense_tracking_in_notion | Setting a Budget]] for Expenses

At the beginning of each month, users can set a budget for specific expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

To set a budget:
1.  Select the date, typically the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Choose the [[creating_and_managing_categories_in_notion | category]] (e.g., "food category") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   For budget setup, the expense name and category name should be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
6.  Input the "budget amount" in the budget column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This column is used at the start of the month to set budget limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Once entered, these figures automatically update all related data in the planner's views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. As more expense information is added, the system automatically updates the top-level views, providing a real-time progress update for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Your Finances

After booking expenses, the system provides various ways to analyze financial data:
*   **By Period:** Clicking on a period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing all transactions for that period, including details of the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **By Year:** Clicking on a year displays budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expense as a percentage of budget, and budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **By Category:** This view shows expense amount, budgeted amount, expense as a percentage, and status for a particular category, along with all related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **By Expense Code:** Users can see how much has been booked for a specific category of expense and month in comparison to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views enable users to track financial performance through the four different overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

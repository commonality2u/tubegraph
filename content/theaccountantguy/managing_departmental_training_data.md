The employee training expenses tracker includes a comprehensive dashboard designed to manage employee training data, categorized by department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This system provides two main views: the training overview and the employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The [[creating_a_training_dashboard_in_notion | training dashboard]] offers insights into all scheduled trainings and individual employee progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Training Overview
This section provides a summary of all trainings, including:
*   The training date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   The number of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   The percentage of attendance for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   The associated training expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

All this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Employee Records by Department
The [[employee_details_management_in_notion | employee record section]] lists employees, organized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

#### Managing Departments
*   **Editing a Department**: To change a department's name, you can click on the department and start editing the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Adding a New Department**: A new department can be added by sliding a control to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

#### Managing Employees within Departments
*   **Moving Employees**: Employees can be quickly moved between departments by dragging their record to the desired department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, or by clicking the three-dot menu next to an employee's name and selecting a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **[[adding_and_editing_employee_categories_and_details | Adding New Employees]]**: New employee records can be added by clicking "add employee," which places them under a "No Department" view initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These can then be moved to the appropriate department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **[[adding_and_editing_employee_categories_and_details | Editing Employee Details]]**: Employee details can be edited by clicking the "edit" button and typing the new information, which updates the records automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Employee-Specific Training Tracking
For each employee, the system displays:
*   The total number of trainings attended versus the total assigned (e.g., "Steve has attended two out of three trainings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   A percentage of attendance for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   The "next training date," which can be set by clicking and selecting a date, showing the remaining days until the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Training Records and Attendance

The "training record" section allows for managing individual training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Setting Training Details**: For each training, users can set the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, add specific training details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, and select the employees supposed to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **[[tracking_employee_attendance_for_trainings | Tracking Attendance]]**: A checkbox allows users to indicate if employees have attended a specific training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This automatically updates the attendance percentage shown in the training records view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For example, if three employees are supposed to attend Training One, marking two as attended will show 67% attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, while one attended would show 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Adding Training Records**: New training records should be added using the "add training" quick action button, which creates a new entry for details to be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Training Expenses

The "training expenses" section allows for [[editing_and_customizing_training_expenses | managing financial aspects]] of trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Editing Expenses**: Users can edit the expense incurred for any training by clicking a pencil icon and entering the new amount, which updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization**: All currencies within the system can be changed. This can be done by accessing the property settings of the expense field and selecting a different currency format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Currency symbols in the dashboard's formula can also be directly customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Overall Expense Overview

On the left side of the dashboard, an "expenses overview" panel provides a summary of all training-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This includes:
*   The total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   The total number of trainings conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   The total number of employees registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   The average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

This overview updates automatically as new transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

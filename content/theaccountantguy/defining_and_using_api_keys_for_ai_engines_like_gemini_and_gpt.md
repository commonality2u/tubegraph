From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

To begin [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]], a platform designed to create AI-generated content on a Notion workspace, initial settings must be configured, including the definition of API keys for AI engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These settings can be accessed by clicking the gear icon on the home screen or the "settings" option in the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Configuring AI Engine API Keys

Within the settings tab, users need to [[configuring_api_keys_and_database_connections | define the AI engine]] connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] supports both Gemini and GPT as AI engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Obtaining a Gemini API Key

If Gemini is selected, its API key needs to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This key can be obtained by navigating to `AI studio.google.com` and clicking "Get API Key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. A new API key can be created or an existing one copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Obtaining an OpenAI (GPT) API Key

For users [[selecting_and_comparing_gpt_models | selecting GPT]], an OpenAI API key is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This key is generated by visiting `platform.openai.com`, going to the "API Keys" section, and clicking "Create new secret API key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Cost Considerations

It is important to note that Gemini offers free access to its engines with some usage limitations, whereas the OpenAI API key is a paid service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For those seeking a free option to test, Gemini can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Setting Up Notion Internal Integration Secret Key

Beyond the AI engine keys, the Notion internal integration secret key must be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This key facilitates a secure connection between [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] and the user's local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It is considered more secure than using a public key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

To [[setting_up_notion_api_keys_for_pdf_document_creation | create this key]]:
1.  Click the icon next to the Notion internal integration secret field in [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]]'s settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This will open the profile integrations page in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  Click "New integration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  Assign a name (e.g., "[[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] integration") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
4.  Select the desired Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  Ensure the type is "internal" and click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
6.  Click "Configure integration settings" to reveal and copy the internal secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
7.  Paste this key into the corresponding field in [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]]'s settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

This secret key is exclusive to the user's local workspace and should not be shared publicly, enhancing security and accessibility for Notion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Saving and Managing Settings

After defining all necessary API keys and the Notion integration, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. All entered settings are saved in the local storage, meaning they are not stored on an external cloud, ensuring data safety and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Users can clear all defined settings from local storage by clicking the "clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Connecting Notion to Wizzygen for AI Content Creation

Before generating content, it is crucial to [[integrating_notion_with_an_api_key_for_database_access | connect the Notion database]] (or page) to [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] using the internal integration created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is done by clicking the three dots in the top right of the Notion database/page, selecting "Connections," and choosing the [[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This connection needs to be done only once for each database or page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

[[using_wizzygen_to_create_aigenerated_content_in_notion | Wizzygen]] can create AI content on both [[using_notion_pages_for_ai_content | Notion pages]] and [[utilizing_notion_databases_for_ai_content | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Users begin with 10 free prompts and can upgrade for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

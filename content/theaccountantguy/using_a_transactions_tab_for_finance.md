A personal finance tracker, often implemented as a spreadsheet, helps in [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | tracking income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This tool typically features three main tabs: a dashboard, a [[detailing_the_transaction_section_in_notion | transactions tab]], and a budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Initial Setup: The Budget Tab

Before recording [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]], it is necessary to first set up the budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. In this section, you need to:
*   Feed in details related to income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Specify budgeted amounts for each month, whether for expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The "Goal Amount" column automatically totals the monthly entries for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This column is formula-driven, so when [[managing_business_activities_and_transactions | adding new line items]], the formula needs to be dragged down to copy it to new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. New rows can be added to the bottom of the tab as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Utilizing the Transactions Tab

Once accounts and budget estimations are set in the budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, you can begin to [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | add new transactions]] to the [[detailing_the_transaction_section_in_notion | transactions tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For each [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transaction]], you should enter:
*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   The [[entering_and_summarizing_transactions | details of the transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   The [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | category related to the transactions]] (which corresponds to the accounts set up in the budget tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   The amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

A formula-driven property in column E automatically classifies the entry as either an [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | income or expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Similar to the budget tab, this formula needs to be dragged down to new line items as they are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Dashboard Analysis

After [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | entering and summarizing transactions]] in the [[detailing_the_transaction_section_in_notion | transactions tab]], you can navigate to the dashboard section to view the [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | analysis of income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[00:02:44]</a>. The dashboard allows filtering by category, period, and type of reference to display:
*   Total income and expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
*   Net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   Overviews of different income sources and expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   A monthly personal finance overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   A status callout indicating if expenses have been exceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

This allows users to analyze specific details, such as total income for a particular period, or narrow down the view to individual sources of [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | income or expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

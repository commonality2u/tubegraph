This article details how to set up and utilize a small business bookkeeping template in Notion to manage financial transactions. The template is structured into three main sections: "Start Here," "Summary," and "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Template Sections

### Start Here Section

The "Start Here" section is where foundational business information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

#### Accounts Management
This section contains various accounts categorized under different heads:
*   **Expenses**: e.g., Purchase expense, Utility bills, Subscription, Salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: e.g., Accounts payable, Taxes payable, Accrued expenses, Credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

You can manage these accounts by:
*   **Editing**: Hover over an item, click the pencil icon, edit details, and click outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Deleting**: Click the three-dot icon next to an item and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

#### Account Details
For each added account, you can specify:
*   **Opening Balance**: For liabilities and assets, you can enter any carried-forward balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Classify items as per "bills," "debt," "savings," or other relevant options. This is especially useful for categorizing expenses, e.g., utility bills as "bills" or subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: For recurring payments, you can select a frequency like monthly, half-yearly, or quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: For inventory or assets, you can specify the starting units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

#### Setting Net Worth Goal
You can set a net worth goal at the top of the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This goal will be reflected and compared against your actual net worth in the "Summary" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

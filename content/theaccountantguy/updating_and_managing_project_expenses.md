This article explains how to track and manage business expenses for [[construction_project_expense_tracking | construction projects]] using a Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Template Overview
The Notion template features different categories of expenses defined at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each category, a [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | budgeted expense amount]] and the actual expenses are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The actual expenses are derived from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[dynamic_updates_of_expense_values_in_notion | Dynamic Expense Updates]]
Users can modify values in the bottom table, and the expense figures will update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Changes made in the table are reflected in the corresponding expense categories at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Managing Categories and Budgets
The template provides tools for managing expense categories and budgeted amounts:
*   **[[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | Editing Categories]]**: To edit an existing category or define a new one, click on the pencil icon associated with the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **[[adding_and_managing_expenses | Adding New Categories]]**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: To remove a category, click on the three-dot icon next to it and select delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **[[editing_and_managing_budgeted_amounts_for_travel_expenses | Modifying Budgeted Expenses]]**: New budgeted expense amounts can be defined by simply clicking on the existing budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Summary Section
A summary section offers an overview of the project's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section includes:
*   The total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses, pulled from the bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

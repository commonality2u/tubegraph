The savings funds tracker features a dashboard with two primary views to manage your savings goals: the [[tracking_savings_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view and the [[tracking_savings_and_investment_accounts | Savings Overview]] view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Savings Target View

The [[tracking_savings_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view is where you set up different saving funds and their corresponding target or goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This section comes with three default savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To edit an existing saving fund, you have a couple of options:
1.  **Using the Pencil Icon**: Click on the pencil icon next to the saving fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
    *   **Rename**: You can change the name of the saving fund, for example, from a generic name to "car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   **Adjust Goal Amount**: You can also set a new goal amount, such as changing it from $2,500 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Directly Clicking the Entry**: Click on the saving fund entry itself to open all editing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. From here, you can edit both the name and the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Any changes made in the [[tracking_savings_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view will automatically update in the [[tracking_savings_and_investment_accounts | Savings Overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

2.  Click the pencil icon or the new entry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Give the new fund a name, such as "new saving fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. By default, it will be added with a goal amount of $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
4.  You can then adjust the goal amount to your desired value, for example, $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

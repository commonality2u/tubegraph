An income tracker built in Notion can help individuals stay on top of their finances by providing a structured way to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | track income and expenses effectively]] and analyze earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This minimalistic Notion income tracker is designed with four key sections to facilitate comprehensive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Analytical Sections

The income tracker is organized into four main sections that provide different perspectives on income:

*   **Total Earnings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>: This section displays the overall earnings for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Sources of Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>: It breaks down earnings by categories like salary, side hustle, and other sources, showing the total earnings for each and its percentage of the total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>: This part reveals how often income is earned, calculating the total earnings and the number of sources for each frequency type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Overview Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>: This section presents monthly income, segregated into four quarters, along with the percentage of monthly earnings relative to the total earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Underlying Databases for Analysis

To build this income tracker, five interconnected databases are utilized, each playing a crucial role in enabling the analysis:

*   **[[setting_up_income_details_in_notion | Income Details Database]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>: This database stores the raw details of income earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It includes properties for `income details` (title), `period of income` (relation to period database), `income source` (relation to income source database), `frequency of income` (relation to frequency of income database), and `amount` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The sum of income earned during a period is also visible here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **[[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | Income Source Database]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>: This database analyzes different sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Key properties include `name` (e.g., salary, side hustle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, `earnings database` (relation to total earnings database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, `income details` (relation to income details database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, `actual income` (a roll-up property from income details that sums the amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, `total earnings` (a roll-up from the earnings database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, `frequency` (a roll-up from income details) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, and `earnings in percentage` (a formula calculating percentage of total earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Income Database** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>: Provides a comprehensive overview of earning frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It includes `frequency` (title property, e.g., monthly, annual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, `earnings associated to each frequency of income` (roll-up property summing earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, a relation to `income details` database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, and `sources of income` (a formula property indicating the number of sources for each frequency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Total Earnings Database** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>: Reflects the total earnings over a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It simply relates the total earnings from all three income sources and calculates the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Properties include `total earnings` (title) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, `income source` (relation to income source database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and a `total earnings` roll-up property that sums values from income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Period Database** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>: Shows periodical income earned throughout a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This database calculates monthly income and its percentage to total earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It has `month` (title) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, `income details` (relation to income details database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, `earnings` (roll-up from income details summing amounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, `total earnings` (roll-up from total earnings database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, and a `proportion of earnings` formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Presentation of Analytical Data

The primary dashboard provides a visual and organized presentation of the income data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>:

*   **Total Earnings Display**: The total income earned is presented as a linked view to the total earnings database in a list format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Sources of Income Display**: Presented in a three-column layout using a gallery format linked to the income source database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It showcases the actual income and percentage contribution of each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Frequency Display**: This section is derived from the frequency of income database, also in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. It shows total earnings and the number of sources for each earning frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Overview Section**: Linked to the period database and displayed in gallery mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It divides information into four quarters, detailing monthly earnings and their proportion to total earnings. Filters are applied to specify months for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

This comprehensive setup allows for effective [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]] and insightful [[summary_and_quarterly_payment_analysis | summary and quarterly payment analysis]], making it easier to analyze income sources and frequencies.

The Notion savings funds tracker provides a dashboard to [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | track saving goals and contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. It includes two main views: the Savings Target and the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09"></a>.

## Savings Target View

This view allows users to set different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>.

### Managing Saving Funds

*   **Editing Existing Funds**
    To edit an existing saving fund, click the pencil button next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36"></a>. From here, you can rename the saving fund (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a> and set or change its goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>. Changes made here automatically update in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>.
    You can also click directly on the fund to open its details and edit the name or goal amount from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35"></a>.

*   **Adding New Funds**
    To add a new savings fund, click the "add savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a>. A new entry will appear, which you can then name (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a> and set a goal amount for, such as $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24"></a>.

*   **Deleting Funds**
    To delete a saving fund, click the six dots on the left side of the fund's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03"></a>. A "delete" option will appear, which removes the fund from the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>.

## Savings Overview View

The Savings Overview provides a summary of total savings made, the overall targeted saving amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>.

## Tracking Savings Transactions

Savings contributions are added via the transactions panel at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38"></a>. This allows for [[managing_transactions_in_notion | managing transactions]] and linking them to specific saving funds.

### Adding Transactions

*   Click "add transaction" to create a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.
*   Transactions are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53"></a>.
*   You can set a different date using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06"></a>.
*   Enter information for the transaction, such as "saving for car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15"></a>.
*   In the "saving fund" column, select the specific saving fund the contribution is for (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a>.
*   Enter the saving amount contributed for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"></a>.
*   As soon as an amount is added, the total savings and percentage achieved for that fund in the Savings Overview are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>. For example, adding $1,000 to a "car fund" with a previous balance of $1,400 will show a new total of $2,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44"></a>, reflecting 80% of a $3,000 target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49"></a>.

## Customization

*   **Currency:** The tracker supports different currencies. To change the currency, click on any amount, then "edit property," and choose the desired number format from the options Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06"></a>. Assistance for setting up different currencies post-purchase is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20"></a>.
*   **Transaction Grouping:** The transaction view can be grouped by month, week, or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46"></a>. To change this, click the three dots, select "grouping," then "date," and choose the desired time frame (month, week, or year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"></a>. This makes the view dynamically change based on your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01"></a>.

This tracker is fully dynamic and customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16"></a>. For further questions, contact for_my_use@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a>.

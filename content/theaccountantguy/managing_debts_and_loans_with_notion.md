The Notion personal finance tracker provides a dedicated section for managing debts and loans, allowing users to track upcoming payments, monitor past payments, and gain an overview of their total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts
To begin tracking your debts in Notion, navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Under the "Liabilities" section, you can:
*   **Add New Debt**: Click the "New" button to create a new debt account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   Specify the name of the debt (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Enter an **opening balance** for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Classify the account under the "Debt" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   Set a **payment frequency** (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Modify Existing Debt**: Click the pencil icon next to an existing debt to open the edit window and make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Entering Debt Transactions
Once debt accounts are set up, head to the "Transactions" view and select the "Liability" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

To add a debt payment or new loan:
1.  Click "New" to open a new transaction window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
2.  Select the **date** of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
3.  Choose the relevant **debt account** (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
4.  Specify the **payment mode** (e.g., bank, cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
5.  Set the **transaction type**:
    *   **Outflow**: For debt repayments, as money is going out of your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Inflow**: If you are obtaining a new loan, as money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
6.  Enter the **amount** of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

The system will update the total loan amount based on these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments
The "Debt" section under the "Summary" view provides a detailed overview of your debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. It offers two main views:

*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows debts that are due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   Includes the next payment due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Reflects payments made in the past, and can highlight missed payments if the last recorded payment is older than expected based on the set frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

For each debt, you can see:
*   The total loan amount (sum of opening balance and any additional loans taken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   Total repayment displayed in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   The amount that has been paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Customizing the Debt View
You can change the layout of the debt view by clicking the three dots icon, then "Layout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Options include:
*   List view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>
*   Gallery view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>
You can also enable or disable desired properties to display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The default "Board View" groups by "Payment Status" (Upcoming and Past) and is sorted manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## [[Using Notion for financial management | Notion for Couples]]
Couples can effectively use this Notion tracker by splitting different categories of accounts under each financial head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For debts, this means denoting who is responsible for each loan or splitting shared liabilities to track individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

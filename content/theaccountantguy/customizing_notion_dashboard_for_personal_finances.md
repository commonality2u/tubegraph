This article discusses how to utilize and customize a Notion-based Net Worth Tracker to manage and monitor personal finances. The tracker is designed to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners maintain an organized overview of their financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker

The Notion Net Worth Tracker is structured into three main sections to facilitate the calculation and tracking of net worth:
*   **Get Started Section**: Here, users define their specific net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Account Section**: This section allows users to categorize and list all their financial accounts, such as expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: This provides an overview of all finances, displaying closing balances and proportions of each account. It also features a dedicated net worth section for tracking progress against goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Additionally, a **Transactions View** is available for recording all income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities, which feeds into the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up and Customizing Accounts

### Defining Your Net Worth Goal
To begin, set your net worth goal in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This value is easily editable; changing it automatically updates calculations throughout the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Accounts
The "Account" section comes with default accounts, but users can [[Customizing Notion dashboards and views | add new ones]] or edit existing entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   To add a new account, scroll to the desired category (e.g., Income) and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   To edit an existing account, click on the pencil icon associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

When adding an account, fill in details such as:
*   **Name**: E.g., "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: For assets and liabilities, this is the value at the start of the financial year. Income and expenses generally do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Classification (Tags)**: Assign tags to accounts (e.g., "groceries" under "bills", "Netflix" under "subscription"). Users can add their own categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This feature enables [[Customizing categories in Notion expense tracker | customizing categories in your Notion expense tracker]].
*   **Payment Frequency**: Specify how often payments are received or made (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income). Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Opening Units/Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for investments (e.g., Bitcoin), where "Opening Units" tracks the number of units and "Asset Class" is categorized as "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For other accounts, these fields are left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

All account values are fully customizable and can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Recording and Customizing Transactions

The "Transactions" section is divided into four main views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, with an additional "All" view to see all categories combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

To enter a transaction:
1.  Click "New" within the desired view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Select the transaction date, which automatically classifies it into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Description**: Provide a brief description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **Category**: This is automatically set based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
5.  **Account**: Link the transaction to one of your previously created accounts (e.g., "Salary Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
6.  **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank Account", "Cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
7.  **Transaction Type**: Specify if it's an "Inflow" (money coming in, like income or new loans) or "Outflow" (money going out, like expenses or loan repayments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
8.  **Amount**: Enter the numerical value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
9.  **Document**: Attach receipts or bills for record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Analyzing Your Financial Summary and Net Worth

### Net Worth View
This section displays key statistical figures related to your net worth:
*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target you set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as Assets minus Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between your net worth goal and your total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The increase in net worth from your opening net worth (calculated from opening balances of assets and liabilities) to your current closing net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows what percentage of your goal has been accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, your net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This provides [[Advanced features in Notion for financial tracking | advanced features in Notion for financial tracking]].

## Beyond Net Worth: Expanding Financial Tracking

While the Net Worth Tracker is robust, a more comprehensive template for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances in Notion]] is available, offering additional features for a complete financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This includes:
*   Debt payments tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>
*   Budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>
*   [[Dynamic views and customization in Notion savings tracker | Dynamic views and customization in Notion savings tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>
*   Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
*   Detailed investment tracking, including current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

This template can be accessed as an upgrade from the Net Worth Tracker, often via a navigation pane within the Notion setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

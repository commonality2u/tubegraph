The [[paycheck_budget_tracker_demonstration | paycheck budget tracker]] is designed to help users track paycheck payments and budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is comprised of several key [[components_of_budget_tracker_template | components]] or [[sections_of_the_paycheck_tracker_template | sections]] that facilitate [[budgeting_and_expense_tracking | budgeting and expense tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overview of Main Sections

The tracker is primarily divided into two main display areas: a summary section on the left and an account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Summary Section (Left Side)

The summary section provides a quick overview of financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Total expenses that have been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

### Account Section (Right Side)

Within the account section, users can categorize and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Expenses can be added under three default categories:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to customize these category names as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, a budgeted amount can be set for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[utilizing_transaction_section_for_budget_management | transaction section]] is where all individual financial transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Users can add all transactions related to every expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Data entered here automatically updates and reflects in the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, expenses incurred, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

For enhanced usability, the tracker includes quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction:** Clicking this button automatically adds a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to quickly input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source:** This button automatically adds an expense under one of the main expense heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. New expense sources initially appear under fixed expenses but can be easily moved to any other category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

These sections and features enable users to effectively track budgeted payments and manage their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

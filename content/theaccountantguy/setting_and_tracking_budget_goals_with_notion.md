This Notion template provides a comprehensive [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budgeting tracker]] designed to meet various [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]] requirements  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers an overview of different financial components and their tracking functionalities  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Template Components and Goal Setting
The [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budgeting tracker]] is built around five primary components: Income, Expense, Debt, Bills, and Savings  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

*   **Income**: Users can set a "goal amount" for each income component for each month  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Expense**: A "budget amount" can be set for expenses, which automatically updates as expenses are incurred  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Tracking Progress
The template provides detailed tracking for each financial component:
*   **Percentage Tracking**: It displays the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been incurred as an expense or achieved as income  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Budget Status**: A "budget status" indicates whether an expense has exceeded the budgeted amount or if it has stayed within the budget  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This explanation applies to all five components  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Overviews
The left side of the template provides overviews for each component  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. By selecting a component from a dropdown, such as "income overview", users can see all added income categories  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For each category, it shows the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved across all months  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Similarly, for expense sources, it shows the targeted amount and the expense incurred  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Users can add an unlimited number of categories for each component, and the display updates automatically  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Recording Transactions
Users input all transaction details in a dedicated section with quick buttons  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Clicking an "income" or "expense" button automatically adds an entry for the current date  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

For each transaction, the following details are required:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month**: The month of the transaction  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Users can add new months and years  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Year**: The year of the transaction  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the income or expense source (e.g., Salary, Side Hustle, Food, Entertainment, Shopping)  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Categories can be edited  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique code representing the source of income or expense for specific month-wise collation  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This helps in [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | tracking income and expenses]] across different specific months and sources  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: Set at the start of the month for each source  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense amount incurred  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

All data entered here automatically updates the main overview  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The currency can be changed from dollars to any other currency within Notion's number format settings  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Monthly Overview and Summaries
Below the transaction input section, there's a detailed month-wise summary  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For expenses, for example, it shows categories like Food, Entertainment, and Shopping, categorized by month (e.g., Jan 2024)  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. As new monthly data is added, such as a food expense for February, the summary automatically updates to include the new month and its associated elements  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The percentage of the budgeted amount incurred and the budget status (e.g., "under budget") are dynamically displayed for each category and month  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allows users to understand their [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]] performance  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering
The summary views can be dynamically filtered:
*   **By Year**: Users can add a filter to display data for a specific year (e.g., 2024)  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **By Month**: Filters can also be applied to view data for a particular month across all years, or a specific month within a specific year  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Funds Balance
A "Funds Balance" overview shows the income, spending, and the remaining balance at the end of each month  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Income is derived from income sources, while spending aggregates expenses, debt payments, bills payments, and savings  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the financial position at the close of each month  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> and can also be filtered by year and month  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This makes it a comprehensive [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracker]] and an effective tool for [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | setting budgets and recording transactions in Notion]] and [[using_notion_for_budgeting_and_savings | tracking income and expenses in Notion]].

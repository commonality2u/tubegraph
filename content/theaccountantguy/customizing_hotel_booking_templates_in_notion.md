From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

Notion provides a simple template for [[using_notion_for_hotel_booking_tracking|tracking hotel bookings]] that is highly [[customization_and_adaptability_of_notion_templates|customizable]] to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template allows users to monitor bookings and guest details efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, two main KPIs are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Bookings by Room Type**: Shows the number of bookings made for different room categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Below each room type, the number of guests who booked that specific room is indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**: Tracks how many guests require a free pickup service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It distinguishes between guests who have requested pickup ("Yes") and those who have not ("No") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These are small KPIs added for the database's specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Guest Booking Details Table

The bottom of the template features a simple table for entering detailed guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request**: A placeholder text can be edited to include any specific requests from the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date**: This column initially only includes the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Time can be added by clicking on the date property and selecting the "Include time" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: Similar to arrival date, time can be included in this column as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Room Type**: Guests can select from pre-defined room types or create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. New room types automatically get added as a category and are reflected in the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Guest Count**: Users can add the number of guests for each reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup**: A "Yes" or "No" option that updates the free pickup summary at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Customization Options and Adaptability

The template is designed to be entirely [[customization_and_adaptability_of_notion_templates|customizable]] for specific user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> [!INFO] Customization Examples
> *   **Adding Time to Dates**: Users can add time to the arrival and departure dates as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
> *   **Managing Room Types**: New room types can be easily typed in and added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The icon for a room type can also be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Changes to room types in the table are automatically synced and updated in the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
> *   **Integrating Guest Count into KPIs**: Although the guest count is not displayed in the top KPIs by default, it can be added through further [[customizing_databases_in_notion|customization]] of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The template functions by simply adding details at the bottom of the table, which then automatically reflect in the summary KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

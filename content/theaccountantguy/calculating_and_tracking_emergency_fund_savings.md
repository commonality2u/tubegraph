This guide explains how to utilize a template designed to track emergency funds. The template offers a comprehensive system to manage your savings, providing an overview of your progress towards your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

The template is structured into three main sections:

*   **Savings Overview**: Provides a summary of all savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: Reflects all savings and necessary contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The fund setup section allows you to categorize and define individual emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories

*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

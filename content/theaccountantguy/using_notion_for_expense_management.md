[[managing_business_expenses_in_notion | Notion]] can be effectively used to track and manage restaurant operation business expenses through a dedicated template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This template provides a quick and easy way to monitor finances in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Template Overview
The [[overview_of_notion_expense_tracker | Notion expense tracker]] template for restaurant operations organizes expenses into three distinct categories displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Key Features

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses
For each expense category, the template allows for a budgeted expense to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. To set or adjust a budgeted expense, users can click on the existing value and define a new budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A percentage indicator visually represents the proportion of actual expenses incurred in comparison to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates
All expense values within the template update dynamically as figures are inputted, ensuring real-time tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Managing Categories
The template offers flexibility in managing expense categories:

*   **Modifying Categories**: Categories can be modified by clicking on a pencil icon, and changes will automatically update across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This is part of [[using_notion_to_edit_and_update_expense_details | using Notion to edit and update expense details]].
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: Categories can be deleted by clicking on the three-dot menu and selecting the delete option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Summary Section
A dedicated summary section provides a concise overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section includes:
*   The total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The overall percentage of actual expenses incurred to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

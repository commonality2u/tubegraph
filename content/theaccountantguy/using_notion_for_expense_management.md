Notion offers a template designed to [[expense_tracking_using_notion | track business expenses]] specifically for construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template provides a quick and easy way to keep track of a construction project's expenses in one Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Template Overview
The template categorizes expenses at the top, displaying both a budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a modifiable table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. As values are changed in the table, the expenses update corresponding to their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Managing Categories
You can manage expense categories within the template:
*   **Edit Category** To edit an existing category, click on the pencil icon associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Add New Category** To add a new category, click on the "new page" option, which will add a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Delete Category** To delete a category, click on the three-dot icon and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Managing Budgeted Expenses
The budgeted expense amount for any category can be defined by simply clicking on the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Summary Section
The template includes a summary section that provides an overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section displays:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Total actual expenses (pulled from the table at the bottom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

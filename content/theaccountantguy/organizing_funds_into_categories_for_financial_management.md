This article outlines a template designed to help individuals track and manage their emergency funds by [[organizing_expenses_into_categories_like_travel_meals_and_lodging | organizing expenses into categories]] and monitoring contributions towards specific financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is divided into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Fund Setup**: Where emergency fund categories and individual funds are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview**: Provides a comprehensive look at all savings made to date across various funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Summary**: A top-level view of total savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Fund Setup and Categorization

The initial step involves setting up the emergency funds within predefined or custom categories, effectively [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | setting up expense categories and budgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Predefined Categories
The template includes three standard categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

### Customizing Categories
Users can modify existing category names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> or [[managing_and_editing_expense_sources_and_categories | add new categories]] to suit their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which aligns with [[creating_an_expense_categories_system | creating an expense categories system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Adding New Funds
New funds can be added with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Once added, a new fund appears under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, from where it can be moved to its respective category, for example, "Financial Safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Fund Details
Each fund can be detailed with the following information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
*   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The target savings amount for this specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date when contributions to this fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which the goal amount is intended to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
The system automatically calculates savings made to date based on the contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Contribution Tracking and Management

Once funds are set up, users can navigate to the "Contribution" section to [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | add and categorize expenses]] related to their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Monthly Contributions
Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For each contribution, users can enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>:
*   **Date**: The specific date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief detail about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year the contribution pertains to (e.g., March 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Selection of the specific emergency fund the contribution is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The actual amount contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Required Contribution
A crucial feature is the "Requirement" column, which indicates the monthly contribution needed to reach the fund's goal amount by the target end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If the actual contribution meets or exceeds the required amount, a tick mark appears, providing a quick visual cue of goal attainment for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Quick Action Button
A "quick action" button automatically adds a new line item for the current month and date, simplifying the entry process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview
The "Quarterly Overview" section provides a consolidated view of contributions across quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Users can see total savings and required amounts for each month within a quarter, along with a percentage indicating progress against savings requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Different colors are used to provide a quick visual snapshot of financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This view helps in [[using_filters_and_categories_to_manage_financial_data | using filters and categories to manage financial data]] and track progress.

For each fund, it displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
*   **Total Savings**: Sum of the starting balance and all contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

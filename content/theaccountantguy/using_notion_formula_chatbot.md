The Notion Formula Chatbot is a tool designed for Notion users who struggle to find the correct formulas for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This chatbot helps users derive the exact formulas they need within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin using the chatbot, you must first place your OpenAI API key into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. After entering the API key, you need to select your preferred GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Generating an OpenAI API Key

1.  Click on the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find a link that directs you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
2.  On the OpenAI platform, navigate to the "Open API Keys" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
3.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
4.  Provide details if prompted and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
5.  **Important:** Copy the generated key immediately, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
6.  Paste the copied key into the Notion Formula Chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. A message will confirm that the API key has been entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

When creating an OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit to test the chatbot, which is limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Selecting a GPT Model

The chatbot offers two GPT models for use:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo:** An older model that is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. It is suitable for users on the free OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **GPT 4106 Preview:** A newer model that provides better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This model is recommended for users on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

The entire video demonstration was performed using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Interacting with the Chatbot

The chatbot interface is divided into three sections: "Info," "Chat," and "Give" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Interaction primarily occurs in the "Chat" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

To start, you can type an initial message, such as "Hi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The chatbot will then generate a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Formula Examples

The chatbot can provide formulas for various Notion use cases:

*   **[[using_formulas_to_add_numbers_in_Notion|Adding Two Numbers]]**: When asked, "What is the formula to add two numbers in Notion?", the chatbot provides `propertyA + propertyB`, where Property A and B are the numbers to be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Calculating Time Difference Between Dates**: For finding the difference between a birth date and today's date in years in Notion, the chatbot suggests using the `dateBetween` formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Conditional (IF) Statements**: The chatbot is fluent with IF conditions. For example, if asked to output "number one" if it's greater than "number two," otherwise output "number two," it provides the corresponding `if` formula: `if(numberOne > numberTwo, numberOne, numberTwo)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

The chatbot responds instantly with explanations, identifying what needs to be input into the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Sometimes, clearer prompting with examples or references may be needed to help the chatbot generate the most accurate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Customization and Other Features

### Image Option

You can upload an image to change the user icon displayed during conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This is an optional feature for personalizing your interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Clicking the "X" button will revert the icon to the original user image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

### User Interface Customization

*   **Color Theme**: To change the color theme from dark to light, click the three dots on the right, go to "Settings," then "App theme colors and font," and select "Light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. You can also revert to "Dark" or use "System settings" to customize colors further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Font Family**: Within the settings, you can also change the font family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

If the left panel (where API keys and other settings are entered) is not visible, click the arrow on the left side of the chat window to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This is especially useful for smartphone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

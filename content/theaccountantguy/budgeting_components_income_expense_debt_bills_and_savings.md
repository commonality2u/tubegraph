The budgeting tracker template offers various options to fulfill [[budgeting_and_savings_strategy | budgeting]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview]] of the system upon download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Core Components
The budgeting tracker consists of five main components:
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Expense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

For each component, a targeted or budgeted amount can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   For [[tracking_income_and_expenses | income]], a goal amount can be set for each income component monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   For [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | expense]], a budget amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   A percentage indicates how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   A "budget status" shows whether expenses have exceeded the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Overview of Elements
On the left side of the tracker, an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview]] of all different elements for each component is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   A dropdown menu allows selecting different components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   For example, clicking on "income [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview]]" displays all income categories added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   For each category, the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved are shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   This provides an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview]] across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   A [[monthly_budget_setup | monthly overview]] is also available at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   When selecting different components from the dropdown, the targeted amount and incurred expense (for expense sources) or goal amount and met income (for income sources) are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Users can add as many categories as desired for each component, and the display will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Transaction Input
To input transactions, a section with "quick buttons" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Clicking on an "income" button automatically adds an income entry to the income window, dated to the current day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Required details for an entry include: detail, date, month, year, category, code, budget amount, and actual amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Months can be added for different years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Categories for income (e.g., salary, side hustle) or [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | expense]] can be fed in and edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A "code" represents the source of income or expense for the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This code, combined with month and year, helps to collate different sources of income and expenses for specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   At the start of the month, a budget amount can be set for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The actual amount is then entered as the month progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This input method applies to all different components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Currency can be changed from the default dollar to any other choice via the number format option in properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Monthly Summary
Below the transaction input section, a [[monthly_budget_setup | month-wise summary]] is provided, mirroring the top-level summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   For example, an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | expense summary]] shows categories like food, entertainment, and shopping, broken down by month (e.g., Jan 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   As new monthly entries are added, the summary dynamically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   When entering an expense, the budget amount set at the start of the month is displayed, and as actual expenses are incurred, the system calculates the percentage of the budgeted amount used and indicates if the user is under or over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This principle applies to all elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Filtering Options
The data can be dynamically filtered:
*   Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Filters can also be applied for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Funds Balance
A "funds balance" view shows the income and spending for every month, along with the remaining balance at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   This balance updates automatically when income and [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | expense]] entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Spendings are derived from all expenses, [[debt_payment_tracking_and_reporting | debt payments]], bills payments, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Income comes from specified income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   This provides a quick glance at the account balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   The funds balance can also be dynamically filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

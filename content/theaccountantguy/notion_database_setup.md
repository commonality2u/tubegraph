This article outlines how to calculate the product of two numbers within a [[creating_a_database_in_notion|database]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The process involves setting up a database with specific properties and then utilizing two different formulas to achieve the product calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Structure

To calculate the product, a database is set up with the following properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Operator Name** This property serves as the name of the operator (e.g., "multiply operator") and is assigned a `Title` property type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Number Properties** Two separate properties are created, each assigned a `Number` property type, to input the numbers for which the product needs to be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Formula Properties** Two distinct formula properties are used for calculating the product using different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Product Calculation Formulas

Two methods can be employed within Notion to calculate the product of two numbers:

### 1. Multiply Operator Formula

This formula utilizes a dedicated "multiply operator" to calculate the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The two numbers are provided as input to this formula to determine their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

*   **Example**: If the input numbers are 2 and 3, the multiply operator formula will return a product of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### 2. Multiply Symbol Formula

This formula provides a more direct approach by simply placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two numbers to multiply them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

By implementing either of these two formulas within your Notion database, you can effectively calculate the product of two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

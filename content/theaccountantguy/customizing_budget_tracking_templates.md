Budget tracking templates, such as the one used for [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | film production budget tracking]], are designed to help users monitor expenses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These templates are highly customizable to meet individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Template Components and Customization

A typical budget tracker template includes a table that lists all expenses, their respective categories, and the amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Key customizable elements include:

*   **Expense Categories**
    *   Users can [[customizing_expense_categories | define their own categories]] by clicking a pencil icon next to the category field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   New categories can be added via a "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Existing categories can be edited using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   Categories can be deleted by selecting the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Expense Values**
    *   The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Actual Expense Amounts**
    *   Users can enter the actual expense amount directly into the expense side of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

All updates made to these values are reflected instantaneously across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This ensures that the budget remains current and accurate.

## Summary Section

The template includes a summary section that provides an overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This section typically displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This summary provides a quick snapshot of the total expenses and how they compare to the initial budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This guide explains how to calculate the product of two numbers within a [[creating_a_database_in_notion | Notion database]] using different formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Database Structure Example

An example database is set up to demonstrate product calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This database consists of:
*   **Name of the operator**: This property has a title property assigned to it, representing the multiply operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Two numbers**: Each number has a number property assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Formulas**: Two different formulas are used to calculate the product of the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Calculating Product Using Formulas

Two methods are presented for calculating the product of two numbers in a [[creating_a_database_in_notion | Notion database]]:

### 1. Multiply Operator Formula
This method utilizes a "multiply operator formula" where the two numbers are provided as input to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For example, if 2 and 3 are provided as numbers, the product calculated using this formula is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Multiply Symbol Formula
Another formula simply multiplies the two numbers by placing the multiply symbol (`*`) in between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both formulas enable the calculation of the product of two numbers within a [[creating_a_database_in_notion | Notion database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The business expense tracker in Notion helps to [[managing_business_expenses_using_notion | keep track of all business expenses]] under one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A key component of this tracker is the ability to [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | define and manage expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Defining Expense Categories

The tracker comes with some predefined heads of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Users can also add new categories of their choice by clicking the "new" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Modifying and Updating Categories

To [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | modify or change an existing category]], simply click on it and then click "done" to save the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If you need to change a subcategory, click on the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Setting Budgeted Amounts for Categories

After defining your expense categories, you can set a budgeted amount for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This budgeted amount will automatically be reflected in the tracker's overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Expense Overview and Budget Tracking

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It displays:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Budgeted expenses that were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   A percentage indicating whether you have exceeded or are within your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

For example, if the budgeted amount for advertising is changed from $100 to $5,000, all related figures in the expenses overview will automatically update to reflect this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The summary on the left side of the tracker provides additional details, including the budgeted expense, total expense, the difference, and the percentage of the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

In the "transaction" section, you can input your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This involves:
1.  Choosing the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Adding a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Selecting or adding any predefined accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Entering the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The house rent payments tracker template allows users to keep track of house rental payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system facilitates the management of tenant information by organizing tenants under different property classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Property Classifications and Tenant Assignment

The template begins with a summary section that includes four distinct views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. One of these views is dedicated to adding basic information, such as tenants, categorized by the properties owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Currently, the template includes property classifications like "apartment" and "duplex," but users can add any other property types as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Adding New Tenants

To add a new tenant:
1.  Click the "ADD tenant" button located on the left side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  A new tenant entry will be automatically created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  Click on the three-dot icon next to the new tenant entry to place it under the respective property category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
4.  Click the pencil icon to add detailed information for the tenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Property Section Overview

The "property section" of the tracker displays different property classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Under each property, you can view:
*   The name of the tenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   The total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

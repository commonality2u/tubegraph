This article explores how a Notion template can be used to track [[hotel_booking_reservations_tracking_in_notion | hotel booking reservations]] and display key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The template is designed to provide a simple way to monitor booking data and can be [[customizable_notion_templates_for_hotel_data_management | customized]] for specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>.

## Overview of KPIs

The template features two main types of [[invoice_payment_summary_and_key_performance_indicators_kpis | KPI]] information prominently displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

*   **Bookings by Room Type:** This KPI shows the number of bookings made for various room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Below each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests:** This KPI tracks how many guests require a free pickup service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It presents a "yes" or "no" option, indicating the count of guests who have requested the service versus those who have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

These are specific KPIs added for the database's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Data Entry and Management

The core of the system is a simple table at the bottom, where detailed booking information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Inputting details into this table automatically updates the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:09">[03:00:09]</a>.

### Table Columns

The table includes the following fields for each booking:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request:** A placeholder text where any guest requests can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date:** This field captures the guest's arrival date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The option to include specific arrival times is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Departure Date:** Similar to the arrival date, a departure date can be set, with the option to include a specific departure time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Room Type:** Guests can be assigned a specific room type from a pre-defined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. New room types can also be typed in and automatically created as a new category, which then reflects in the top KPI summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Changing a room type automatically updates the top summary, ensuring a two-way sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Guest Count:** This numerical field allows for recording the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup:** A simple "yes" or "no" option that updates the free pickup KPI summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Customization and Extensions

The template is fully customizable to meet specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>. For example, while the "Guest Count" is currently not displayed in the top KPI summary, it can be added with certain template customizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:16">[02:30:16]</a>. Users can reach out to the creator for further customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a>.

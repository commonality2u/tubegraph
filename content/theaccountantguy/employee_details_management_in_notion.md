The [[setting_up_employee_schedule_using_notion | employee schedule template]] in Notion can be utilized to manage and track the schedules of employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template offers four distinct views to help oversee employee data and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Overview of the Employee Schedule Template

The template includes the following primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
*   **Employee Details**: Lists all employees and their associated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **[[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | Task Schedule]]**: Used for entering tasks for employees on specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Monthly View**: Displays monthly data, divided into quarters, showing hours worked or leave taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance**: Shows detailed performance information categorized by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Employee Details View

This section is the starting point for managing employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Adding New Employees
To add a new employee, click the "new" button and input the employee's name, employee ID, and contact information under the relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Additional details such as department, position, and email ID can also be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Managing Categories/Departments
The template comes with pre-defined categories such as operations, marketing, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add new categories by clicking the plus icon or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Quick Action Button
A "quick action" button labeled "add employee" on the top allows for automatically adding a new employee entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Integrating with Task Scheduling and Performance Tracking

Once employee details are added, the information flows into other sections of the template:

*   **[[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | Task Schedule]]**: After adding employee details, users can move to the [[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | task schedule]] section to enter task-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This section categorizes tasks by shifts (first, second, third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. When an employee is selected, their respective department, set in the employee details, is automatically displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The system also automatically computes the hours worked on specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Employees can mark their attendance (present, on leave, day off) and update task statuses (in progress, completed, not started, not applicable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Monthly View**: This view provides an overview of performance, showing total hours worked and total hours on leave for specific months, which are divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance**: For individual employee performance tracking, this section displays hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

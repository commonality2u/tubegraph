## Sales Receipts Tracker (Notion Template)

A sales receipts tracker template can be utilized to keep track of sales. It includes a sales receipts database with relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Database Information
The database includes columns for:
*   Receipt number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Receipt date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Payment method (with several options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Business name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Business address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Customer details: This is a relational property linked to another database containing client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Customer address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Description of items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   Unit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale across different rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The subtotal column sums up the total amount of individual items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A tax rate is applied, and the total amount is computed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. A 'notes' column is available for additional information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary
At the top, a sales receipt summary displays key metrics:
*   **Total sales**: Drawn from the sales value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units sold**: Represents the quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Average sales value**: Calculated as total sales divided by units sold, providing key business information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   *Note*: If adding more columns for descriptions or quantities, update the formulas for subtotal and total amount calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Client Summary
A client summary section shows:
*   Total sales for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Total quantity of sales made to each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Average sales price for every client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

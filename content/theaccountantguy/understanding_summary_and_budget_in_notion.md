The [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | Notion expenses tracker]] is a tool designed to help users manage all their expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This versatile [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | template]] can be used for tracking any kind of expense, whether personal or business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is also entirely customizable to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Categories Section

The [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | expense tracker]] includes a categories section at the top, which initially features three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each category can be customized to personal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Managing Categories

*   **Renaming Categories:** Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Clicking this icon allows users to rename the category as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. After renaming, pressing enter saves the new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Editing or Deleting Categories:** To edit or delete a category, click on the three dots next to it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** A new category can be added by simply clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses within Categories

For every category, there is a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The "budgeted expense amount" can be set by clicking on it within the category section, allowing users to define their budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   The "actual expense amount" updates automatically as expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Expense Tracking and Updates

Below the categories, three different categories are defined, and expenses are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. As amounts are entered into the expense list, all related categories are updated in real-time with the respective expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides a concise overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

This section displays:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount:** This figure reflects the total budget set across all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, if categories sum up to a $10,000 budget, this will be reflected here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount:** This figure is computed from the expenses entered in the table below the categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Difference:** The numerical difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Expense Spent:** This indicates how much of the budget has been utilized so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

All these figures in the summary section update automatically as new budgeted amounts are set or expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This allows users to [[budget_management_with_notion | track your expenses]] and requirements effectively in one unified [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

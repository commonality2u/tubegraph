A Notion-based [[using_notion_for_business_expense_tracking | business expense tracker]] template is available to help consolidate and manage all business expenses under one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This tracker allows users to define, monitor, and manage their business expenditures efficiently, including [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | setting and managing budgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Key Components of the Tracker

The tracker is structured with several key sections to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed management of finances:

### Expense Categories
This section allows users to define different types of expenses a business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Predefined Categories:** The template comes with some predefined heads of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Modification:** Categories can be modified or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Subcategories can also be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** New expense categories can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This budgeted amount is automatically reflected in other parts of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, if the budgeted amount for advertising is changed from $100 to $5,000, all related overviews update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

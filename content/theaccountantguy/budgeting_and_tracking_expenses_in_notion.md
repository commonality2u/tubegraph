## How to use Notion for expense management

### Setting Up Income and Expense Accounts

To begin [[expense_tracking_using_notion | tracking income and expenses]], first navigate to the "account section" under the "get started view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This section lists all income and expenses linked to your personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Examples of income include "salary" and "side hustle," while expenses might include "groceries," "utility bills," and "Netflix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

To add new income or expenses, click the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Existing entries can be modified using the "edit" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When setting up expenses, you can classify them into categories like "bills," "subscriptions," "savings," or "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. You can also specify the payment frequency (e.g., "monthly," "annually") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Entering Income and Expense Transactions

After setting up accounts, go to the "transactions view" to record income and expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The transactions view offers five sub-views:
*   **All View** Shows all types of transactions (assets, liabilities, income, expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Category-Specific Views** Separate sections for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities to input transactions under their respective heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

To add an income transaction, navigate to the "income section" and click "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Select the date, add a description (e.g., "salary income"), choose the account (e.g., "salary"), select the payment mode (e.g., "bank," "cash"), and set the transaction type to "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Finally, enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

For expenses, the process is similar, but the transaction type will be "outflow" since money is leaving the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Tracking Income and Expenses in the Summary View

Once transactions are entered, [[managing_business_expenses_using_notion | tracking income and expenses]] can be done in the "summary view," specifically under the "finances view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This view classifies accounts under four heads: income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

It displays the total amount of income earned and total expenses incurred, along with the percentage contribution of each account to the respective totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Any changes to transaction figures automatically update the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Tracking Debt Payments

To track debt, first set up debt accounts under the "liabilities" part of the "account section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. New debts can be added by clicking "new," providing a name, an opening balance, classifying it as "debt," and setting a payment frequency (e.g., "monthly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Existing debts can be edited via the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

To record debt payments, navigate to the "liability section" under "transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Add a new transaction, select the date, choose the debt account (e.g., "home loan"), specify the payment mode (e.g., "bank"), and set the transaction type to "outflow" for repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. If obtaining a new loan, the transaction type would be "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The total loan amount will automatically update with repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

The "debt view" under the "summary section" provides an overview, categorized into "upcoming payments" (due in the future) and "past payments" (missed or recently paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It shows the total loan amount, repayment percentage, and the amount remaining unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The view can be customized (e.g., list, gallery) via the layout options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Budgeting for Personal Finances

To budget, first ensure all income and expense transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Then, go to the "summary view" and click on "budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This section outlines all incurred expenses and income, showing how much has been spent as a percentage of the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

You can click on any expense or income item to adjust its budgeted amount, which will instantly update the reflected percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. If a "budgeted amount" property is not visible, it might be hidden and can be revealed by clicking on the property and searching for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Tracking Savings

To track savings goals, navigate to the "account section" and go to the "asset part," as savings are considered assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Create new savings funds (e.g., "car fund") and classify them under the "savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Specify a "goal amount" for each fund by editing the account entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

To add transactions for savings, go to the "asset section" under "transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Create a new transaction, provide a description (e.g., "car fund savings"), select the specific savings account (e.g., "car fund"), choose the payment mode (e.g., "bank"), and set the transaction type as "outflow" as money is moving from your general account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Enter the amount, and it will be reflected in the savings section, showing progress towards the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Icons can also be added to savings accounts for visual distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### Setting Up and Tracking Bills

To manage bills, categorize relevant expenses under the "bills" classification in the "expenses" part of the "account section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Set a payment frequency for each bill (e.g., "monthly" for Wi-Fi bills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

To record bill payments, use the "expense part" under "transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. Enter the date, description, bill account, payment mode, and set the transaction type as "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

The "bills part" of the "summary section" organizes payments into "upcoming payment" and "past payment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments** are bills due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Past Payments** are bills that were due in the past and might have been missed or recently paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Tracking Subscriptions

[[Creating an Expense Tracker with Notion | To track subscriptions]], specify expense accounts under the "subscription" classification in the "account section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Set the payment frequency (e.g., "annual," "quarterly") for each subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

Record subscription payments in the "expenses view" under "transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Similar to bills, enter the date, select the subscription account, payment mode, and set the transaction type as "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

The "subscription view" under the "summary" section displays "upcoming payments" and "past payments," helping to identify due dates and any missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. It also shows the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### Tracking Net Worth

Net worth is calculated as the difference between assets and liabilities at the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

To track net worth:
1.  **Set a Net Worth Goal:** In the "net worth goal section," specify your target net worth for the financial year (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
2.  **View Net Worth Summary:** The "net worth section" under "summary" reflects your current net worth (assets less liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.
    *   It shows the difference between your goal and current net worth, indicating how much you are "lagging behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
    *   A percentage indicates the portion of the net worth goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
    *   "Total growth" is calculated as the closing net worth minus the opening net worth, which is derived from the initial opening balances set for assets and liabilities in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Specific Transaction Views

To view transactions related to a specific account (e.g., salary income), click on that account name in the "finances" section of the "summary view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. A "view transactions" option will appear at the bottom, which, when clicked, will automatically filter and display all transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

## Couples Using the Tracker

For couples, the dashboard is equally applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. In the "account section," different categories can be split to denote ownership or responsibility for income, expenses, assets, or liabilities (e.g., "salary by him," "side hustle by her") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This allows for individual tracking within a shared system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

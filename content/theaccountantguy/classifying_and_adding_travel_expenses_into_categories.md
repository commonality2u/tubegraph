This article outlines how to utilize a Notion-based travel expense tracker to categorize, manage, and plan travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tracker features a summary section, an accounts view for setting up expense types, and a section for recording individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories
The first step involves [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | setting up the different expenses]] or "accounts" that will be incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are generally classified under main categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Any expense booked will fall under one of these [[setting_and_managing_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources
To quickly add a new expense source within an existing category:
1.  Click the "Add Expense Source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This automatically adds a new source, initially under the "Travel" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon next to the newly added source to [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | edit its details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, it can be renamed to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  Set the [[editing_and_managing_budgeted_amounts_for_travel_expenses | budgeted amount]] for this expense source, e.g., $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Moving Expense Sources to Different Categories
If an expense source needs to be moved to a different category, such as "Meals":
1.  Click the three dots next to the expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  Select the desired category, like "Meals," to reclassify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Creating New Custom Categories
To add an entirely new expense category (group) not already designated:
1.  Click the plus sign on the right side of the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  This prompts the creation of a new, separate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Modifying Existing Categories
To edit an existing main category group (e.g., Travel, Meals, Lodging):
1.  Click on the category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
2.  Start [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | editing the details]] directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Understanding the Expense Summary
Once accounts and [[editing_and_managing_budgeted_amounts_for_travel_expenses | budgeted amounts]] are set, the "Expenses" section provides an overview:
*   **Total expenses incurred:** Shows the amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Budgeted expense set:** Displays the allocated budget for that expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Percentage of budgeted expense:** Indicates how much of the budget has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   If expenses exceed the budget, the percentage will be over 100% and shown in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   If expenses are within budget, the percentage will be under 100% and shown in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The overall summary shows the total budgeted expenses, total incurred expenses, the difference, and the overall percentage of total expenses to total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Adding Travel Expenses
Individual expenses are classified under the same three main categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### How to Add an Expense
1.  Use the quick addition buttons, e.g., "Add Travel Expense," "Add Meal Expense," or "Add Lodging Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Clicking a button will automatically add a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  Fill in the details for the new expense:
    *   **Description:** A brief note about the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info:** Details about the specific trip, e.g., "Trip to Paris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   **Account:** Select the specific [[categorizing_expenses_in_notion | expense source]] (sub-category) from the list that was set up earlier, such as "Train," "Bus," "Metro," or "Flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Amount:** Enter the monetary value of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Impact on Summary
Once an expense is added and linked to an account, it immediately impacts the "Expenses" summary. For example, if $100 is booked for "Train," this amount will reflect under the "Train" expense source in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a [[editing_and_managing_budgeted_amounts_for_travel_expenses | budgeted amount]] was set for "Train" (e.g., $200), the summary will show the incurred amount ($100) and the percentage spent (50%), often highlighted in green to indicate it's within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

This system for [[utilizing_notion_features_for_detailed_travel_expense_management | utilizing Notion features for detailed travel expense management]] allows users to keep track of spending and plan expenses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

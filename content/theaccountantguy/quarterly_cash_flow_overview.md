The [[cash_flow_template_overview | business cash flow template]] includes a [[quarterly_summary_and_balances_overview | quarterly overview]] section, located on the right side of the cash flow overview, alongside the account section and business activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">00:00:28</a>.

## Purpose and Structure
The [[quarterly_summary_and_balances_overview | quarterly overview]] provides a summary of the cash flow movement for each month, organized into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">00:03:08</a>. The template is structured with four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">00:03:16</a>.

For each month within a quarter, it displays:
*   **Inflow:** The total amount of cash that has entered the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">00:03:23</a>.
*   **Outflow:** The total amount of cash that has left the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">00:03:27</a>.
*   **Net Balance:** The difference between inflow and outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">00:03:30</a>.

This section offers a quick monthly cash flow overview, divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">00:03:31</a>. For example, in Quarter 3 for August 2023, the inflow was $380, outflow was $720, and the net balance was $2080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">00:03:37</a>.

## Updates
The values in the [[quarterly_summary_and_balances_overview | quarterly overview]] automatically update as transactions are added to the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">00:03:49</a>. If figures do not update immediately, clicking on the sum or balance options within the template will refresh them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">00:11:21</a>.

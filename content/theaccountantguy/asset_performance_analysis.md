The asset planner template includes a dedicated section for [[asset_operational_management | operational management]] which provides insights into the performance of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This section allows users to track and analyze asset performance from the moment an asset is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Key Components for Analysis

The overall performance analysis is supported by various integrated sections within the template:

### Asset Details
Under the [[asset_operational_management | operational management]] section, users can record comprehensive asset details, including the asset ID, asset name, and asset type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These details are categorized to cover a wide range of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

A dedicated [[maintenance_tracking_for_assets | maintenance section]] tracks all details related to asset upkeep, including maintenance IDs and asset IDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This information contributes to understanding an asset's operational efficiency and longevity.

### Financial Details

This financial data is essential for a comprehensive asset performance assessment.

The template also features sections for regulatory management and documentation, which indirectly support performance analysis by ensuring compliance and providing easy access to relevant asset-related documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. All required documents related to an asset can be added in the documentation section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## User Reviews

A reviews section allows users to provide feedback and opinions on the assets being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These qualitative insights can complement quantitative performance data.

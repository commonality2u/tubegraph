To calculate the product of two numbers within a database in Notion, two distinct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Database Setup

A typical database for this calculation consists of the following properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
*   **Name of the Operator**: A title property, specifically for the [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Number Properties**: Two separate properties, each assigned a "number" type, to hold the input numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Formula Properties**: Properties dedicated to the [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] that will perform the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

This method involves providing the two numbers as input to a specific [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator formula]] to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Example**: If the numbers `2` and `3` are provided as input, the [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator formula]] will yield `6` as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol

Another approach is to simply multiply the two numbers directly using the multiplication symbol (`*`) placed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Both of these [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] allow for the calculation of the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

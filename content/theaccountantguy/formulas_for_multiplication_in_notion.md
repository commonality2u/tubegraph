To [[calculating_product_of_two_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a database in Notion, two different formulas can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Database Setup

A typical database for this calculation would include:
*   An operator name property (set as a title property) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two number properties for the input numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Formula properties to display the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

For example, if numbers 2 and 3 are provided as input, the product would be 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Formula Methods

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

One method involves using the specific [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In this approach, the two numbers are provided as input to the formula to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol

Alternatively, the product can be calculated by simply placing the [[using_symbols_in_notion_formulas | multiply symbol]] (e.g., `*`) in between the two numbers within a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both of these formulas can be used to calculate the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Within a Notion database, it is possible to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] using [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Two distinct formulas can be used to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup
To calculate the product, a database is typically structured with at least the following properties:
*   A "Title" property for the name of the operator, often labeled as the [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Two "Number" properties, each assigned to one of the numbers intended for multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication

### 1. The Multiply Operator Formula
This method involves using a dedicated [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator]] formula. The two numbers are provided as inputs to this formula to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate their product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

*   **Example**: If the input numbers are 2 and 3, the [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator]] formula will yield a product of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol
Another formula allows for direct multiplication by placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This method is similar to [[using_excelstyle_formulas_in_notion | Excel-style formulas]].

Both of these [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] can be employed to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

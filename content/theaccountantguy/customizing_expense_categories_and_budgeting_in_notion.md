This article details how to customize expense categories and manage budgets within a Notion credit card expense tracker template, designed to help users track credit card payments and monitor spending against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system provides overviews by credit card, month, and year, along with detailed expense tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Customizing Expense Categories

The Notion tracker allows users to [[customizing_categories_and_filters_in_notion | customize categories and filters]] for their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Assigning Categories to Expenses
When booking an expense under the "expense details" section, users can assign a specific category to each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This involves selecting from existing categories or creating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Adding New Categories
Users can [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | add new categories]] in several ways:
*   By typing a new category name while assigning it to an expense in the "expense details" section, which prompts the creation of a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Directly from the "expenses overview" section, by clicking on the category field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   By using the "new" button to add a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, or by editing existing categories using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of all expenses by category, showing the total incurred expense amount against the set budgeted amount for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Users can click on a category to see all relevant details and expenses associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This feature supports [[setting_and_managing_business_expense_categories_in_notion | setting and managing business expense categories in Notion]] or personal ones.

## Budgeting in Notion

The tracker allows users to manage budgets for different expense categories, facilitating [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting and tracking expenses in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Setting and Managing Budgets
In the "expenses overview" section, users can [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | set a budgeted amount]] for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. To set or modify a budget, simply click on the "budget amount" column and enter the desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Tracking Budget Status
Once a budget is set, the system automatically compares the total incurred expense against the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   If expenses are within the set budget, the status will show "under budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   If expenses exceed the budget, the status will show "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

For example, if a budget of $5,000 is set for a category and expenses reach $5,300, the status will display as "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This provides clear [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budget and actual expense tracking in Notion]].

The Notion template is [[customizable_templates_for_personal_or_business_expenses_in_notion | customizable to personal needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Users can [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | customize budget templates in Notion]] and other sections to suit their specific requirements for [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

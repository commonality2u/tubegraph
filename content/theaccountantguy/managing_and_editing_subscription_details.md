This article demonstrates how to utilize a [[overview_of_subscription_expenses_tracker_in_notion | subscription expenses tracker]] to track and manage all your subscription [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Subscriptions are divided into "Active" and "Canceled" [[organizing_subscription_categories | categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Underneath each category, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The total [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] incurred for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The billing period for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Changing Billing Periods
You can change the billing period by clicking on the current one and selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While it's possible to change the name of the billing period, it is recommended not to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Organizing Subscription Categories

The [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] section further divides subscriptions into different sections, such as "Infotainment," "Education," and "Music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Managing Groups
*   **Adding a New Group**: You can add a new [[organizing_subscription_categories | group]] by clicking the plus (+) icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Editing an Existing Group**: Existing groups can be edited by clicking on them and changing their name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Underneath each classification, you'll see the subscription's name, total [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]], and its percentage towards the total subscription [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Adding Subscriptions

A quick action button allows you to "Add Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Clicking this button automatically adds a new subscription, which initially goes under a "Note" subscription category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

To manage a newly added subscription:
1.  Click on the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
2.  Move it to any classification of your choice, such as "Active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The [[tracking_subscription_transactions | transaction]] section is where you input all details to record subscription [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It offers views for "Active Subscriptions" and "Canceled Subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Subscriptions are bifurcated into different months, with the most recent month appearing at the top, showing the total sum of [[adding_and_managing_expenses | expenses]] for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

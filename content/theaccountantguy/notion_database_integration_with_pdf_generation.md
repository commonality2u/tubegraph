This article explores the capabilities of tracking product orders within Notion and the separate functionality of an external PDF generation tool, with a focus on future integration plans for [[connecting_notion_database_and_template_for_pdfs | connecting Notion databases directly for PDF output]].

## Product Order Tracker (Notion Template)

A "products order tracker" is a simple Notion template designed to help businesses keep track of all customer product orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

This template includes a database with key information:
*   **Product Details** Product names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Customer Information** Customer name, billing address, phone number, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Payment Sources** Specifies how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Available sources include debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Gift Item Indicator** Notes whether the product is being sent as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Order Amount** The total amount for the particular order placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The template also provides an order summary at the top, displaying:
*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Number of orders placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Number of customers who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Percentage of customers requesting gift items (e.g., 67%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This percentage dynamically changes as values are updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Breakdown of payment sources, showing the number of customers and respective percentages for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This template is fully customizable to meet specific business needs, allowing for the addition of metrics like average order value and other necessary KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The database can also be expanded to include more items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## PDF Output Tool

A separate solution available at PDF output.com allows users to [[creating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | create PDF documents]] for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Single PDF Generation
Users can select a template (e.g., an invoice template) and currency (e.g., USD, Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. By filling in the required details, the PDF document is automatically populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Once details are entered, a PDF can be downloaded instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Currency selection can be changed, and the invoice will update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Bulk PDF Generation
For exporting multiple PDF documents, a "bulk export mode" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In this mode, users fill in a database with invoice details (e.g., invoice number, date, and other fields consistent with the single PDF mode) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Columns in this database can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. After entering the information, clicking "download all PDF" generates documents one by one based on the filled data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Individual PDFs can also be generated for specific rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Planned Notion Database Integration

Currently, the PDF output tool supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, a significant upcoming feature is the integration with [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This will allow users to input details directly into their Notion database and then [[using_notion_with_pdf_output | export documents]] from the PDF output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

New templates are expected to be added in the future, and users can submit requests for specific template needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Feedback regarding desired features is also welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

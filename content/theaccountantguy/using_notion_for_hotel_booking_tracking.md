This article describes a simple [[Using Notion for Financial Tracking | Notion]] template designed to track hotel bookings. The template provides a clear overview of booking information and key performance indicators (KPIs) for hotel management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The template features two main KPIs displayed at the top for quick insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Room Type Bookings**: This KPI shows the number of bookings made for different types of rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**: This KPI indicates how many guests require a free pickup service (Yes/No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It shows the count of guests who have requested this service and those who have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

These are specific KPIs integrated into the database for tracking purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Booking Details Table

The core of the tracker is a table at the bottom where all booking details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It includes the following columns:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request**: A placeholder text field where any specific requests from the guest can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date**: By default, this field includes only the date, but it can be configured to include a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: Similar to the arrival date, this field can also include a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Room Type**: Users can select from predefined room types or create new ones by simply typing them in the field, which automatically adds them as a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The icon for a room type can also be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Count**: This column records the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While not displayed in the top KPIs by default, it can be integrated with further [[Customizing hotel booking templates in Notion | customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup**: A Yes/No option to indicate whether the guest requires a free pickup service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This selection automatically updates the free pickup summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Notion Sales Receipts Tracker Template

The Notion template features a `Sales Receipts Database` which contains comprehensive information for tracking sales. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

The database includes the following columns:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method** – Offers several options for clearing payments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Business Name** – Customizable to your business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Customer Details** – A relational property linked to another database containing client information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Description** – Details what is being sold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Subtotal** – Automatically sums the total amount of individual items sold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   **Tax Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Total Amount** – Computed automatically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   **Notes** – For any related payment notes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

### Sales Receipt Summary

Located at the top of the template, the `Sales Receipt Summary` provides an overview of sales data:
*   **Total Sales** – Drawn from the sales values. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   **Units Sold** – Based on the quantity of sales. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   If additional columns for descriptions and quantities are added, the formulas for subtotal and total amount will need to be updated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   **Average Sales Value** – Calculated by dividing total sales by units sold, providing key performance indicator (KPI) information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### Client Summary

The `Client Summary` section displays sales information broken down by client:
*   **Total Sales per Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **Total Quantity of Sales per Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   **Average Sales Price per Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>

This summary can be customized as needed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> For further customization assistance, you can contact notionformyuse@gmail.com. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

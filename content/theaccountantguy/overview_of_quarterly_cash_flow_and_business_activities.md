This article provides an overview of the key sections within a business cash flow template designed to help users [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | track their cash flow]]. It covers the summary cash flow, [[understanding_quarterly_rental_summaries | quarterly overview]], and business activity sections, which all update automatically based on entered transactions.

## Cash Flow Overview Summary

Located on the left side of the template's dashboard, the summary section offers a quick glance at your current cash position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

It displays:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Total Inflow:** The total cash received from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Cash Outflow:** The total cash spent through all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Closing Balance:** The end cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

These balances automatically update as new transactions are entered into the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The [[generating_quarterly_summaries_for_receivables_and_payables | quarterly overview]] section, found on the right side of the dashboard, provides a breakdown of cash flow movement across different quarters of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Monthly Breakdown:** Shows the cash flow movement for each month, grouped into four distinct quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Financial Metrics:** For each month within a quarter, it displays:
    *   **Inflow:** The total cash that has come into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   **Outflow:** The total cash that has left the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   **Net Balance:** The difference between inflow and outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** As you continue to add transactions, these figures automatically update to reflect the latest financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, Quarter 3 in August 2023 might show an inflow of $380, an outflow of $720, and a net balance of $2080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

This section provides a quick, [[monthly_and_quarterly_contribution_breakdown | monthly and quarterly contribution breakdown]] for assessing cash flow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Business Activity

The business activity section, located below the quarterly overview, categorizes cash flow based on the nature of business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It helps in [[analyzing_income_and_expenses_with_the_dashboard | analyzing income and expenses]] by distinguishing between core operations, investments, and financing.

It breaks down activities into:
*   **Operating Activities:**
    *   Relate to the core day-to-day operations of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   Examples include salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   This section shows the inflow, outflow, and net balance specifically for operating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Investing Activities:**
    *   Pertain to cash flows from the purchase or sale of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

    *   Displays the inflow, outflow, and net balance for investment-related cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. For instance, an inflow of $700 and an outflow of $1200 result in a net negative balance of $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Financing Activities:**

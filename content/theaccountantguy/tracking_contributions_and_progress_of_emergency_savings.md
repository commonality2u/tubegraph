This article explains how to utilize a Notion template to track emergency funds, contributions, and overall progress towards financial goals. The template is divided into a summary section, savings overview, and fund setup [00:00:09].

## Fund Setup
The "Fund Setup" section is where you define and organize your emergency funds [00:00:26].

### Categories
Emergency funds can be organized into predefined categories such as:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

You can edit existing categories or add new ones as needed [00:00:35].

### Adding and Customizing Funds
To add a new fund, click the "Add Fund" button [00:00:51]. New funds initially appear under a "No Classification" tab and can then be moved to a relevant category [00:00:57].

For each fund, you can customize the following details:
*   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount of money already in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted amount of savings you aim to achieve for this specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date you begin contributing money to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to reach your goal amount for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the savings made to date based on contributions [00:01:42].

## Contributions Tracker
The "Contributions" section is where you record monthly contributions to your emergency funds [00:02:17].

### Monthly Organization
Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top [00:02:35]. Each month shows the total number of contributions made for that period [00:02:41].

### Contribution Details
For each contribution entry, you can input:
*   **Date**: The specific date of the contribution [00:02:45].
*   **Description**: A brief explanation of the contribution [00:02:46].
*   **Period**: The month and year the contribution pertains to (predefined for 2023, customizable for other years) [00:02:47].
*   **Fund**: Select the specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made [00:03:16].
*   **Amount**: The monetary amount of the contribution [00:03:25].
*   **Requirement**: This column automatically calculates and displays the required monthly contribution to meet the fund's goal by the targeted end date [00:03:35].

If the entered `Amount` meets or exceeds the `Requirement`, a checkmark will appear, indicating the monthly target has been met for that fund [00:04:00].

### Quick Action Button
A "quick action button" can be used to automatically add a new line item for the current date and month, simplifying the entry process [00:04:31].

## Quarterly Overview
The "Quarterly Overview" provides a consolidated view of all contributions across different months within each quarter [00:05:09]. This section allows for a quick assessment of monthly and quarterly contribution performance against requirements [00:05:30]. It uses color-coding to offer a snapshot of financial progress for emergency funds [00:06:29]. The total savings for each quarter are also displayed [00:06:41].

## Savings Overview
Located at the top of the template, the "Savings Overview" section provides a detailed breakdown of each emergency fund under its respective classification [00:06:58].

For each fund, it displays:
*   **Total Savings**: The sum of the starting balance and all contributions made to date [00:07:09].
*   **Targeted Savings**: The goal amount set for the fund [00:07:35].
*   **Achievement Percentage**: The percentage of the targeted savings that has been achieved [00:07:46].
*   **Targeted Savings Date**: The end date set for reaching the goal [00:07:50].
*   **Months Left**: The number of months remaining until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date [00:08:05]. This value updates dynamically [00:09:01].
*   **Contribution Required Per Month**: The average monthly contribution needed to meet the target by the end date [00:08:31].

This section offers a comprehensive overview of individual fund progress [00:08:47].

## Summary Section
The top-level "Summary Section" provides an overall financial snapshot of all emergency funds [00:09:17]. This is part of the [[summary_and_analysis_of_emergency_fund_savings | summary and analysis of emergency fund savings]].

It includes:
*   **Total Savings**: The cumulative sum of opening balances for all funds and all contributions made across all funds [00:09:20].
*   **Savings Required**: The total sum of all targeted savings amounts across all emergency funds [00:09:33].
*   **Difference**: The total savings minus the total required savings [00:09:42].
*   **Percentage**: The overall percentage of total targeted savings that has been achieved [00:09:51].

This provides a high-level summary of your overall progress in [[setting_financial_goals_and_net_worth_tracking | setting financial goals]] and building emergency funds [00:09:59].

The entire template is customizable to fit individual requirements [00:10:16]. This system helps in [[tracking_saving_goals_and_contributions_in_notion | tracking saving goals and contributions in Notion]].

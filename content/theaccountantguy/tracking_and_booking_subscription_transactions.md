This article demonstrates how to utilize a dedicated [[subscription_expenses_tracker_overview | subscription expenses tracker]] to efficiently [[tracking_subscriptions_and_bills_using_notion | track all subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Categories View
Subscriptions are categorized under "Active" and "Cancel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
Under each category, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   The billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

The billing period can be changed by clicking on the respective field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Expenses Section
The "Expenses" section divides subscriptions into different types, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   You can add a new group by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Existing groups can be edited by clicking on them and changing the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Underneath each classification, you'll find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   The percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

A "quick action button" allows you to add a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Newly added subscriptions initially appear under a "not subscription" category and can be moved to any desired classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Details of a subscription can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction" section is where you [[tracking_and_managing_transactions_for_cash_flow | feed all details]] to [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | book subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Views
This section includes:
*   An "Active Subscriptions" view showing all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   A "Cancel Subscription" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Transactions

1.  **Status**: Click the checkbox to indicate the subscription is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: Select the subscription account, which pulls from the subscriptions added in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the billing period set at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Choose the date of payment for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Enter the subscription expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
6.  **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the billing period set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, if Netflix was paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period, the next renewal date would be October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The system also supports annual and weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Cancelling Subscriptions

This will automatically set its status to "cancel" and reflect in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For instance, a YouTube subscription marked for cancellation will appear in the "Cancel" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

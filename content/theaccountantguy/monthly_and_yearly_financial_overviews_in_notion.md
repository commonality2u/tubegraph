An Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to utilize a monthly budget planner in Notion to [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budget for each month]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This system allows for [[using_notion_for_financial_management | managing finances with Notion]] by providing comprehensive overviews.

## Overview Sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

The budget planner features four primary views to help users [[using_notion_to_monitor_financial_summaries_and_net_worth | monitor financial summaries and net worth]]:
*   Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Summary of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
This view breaks down expenses into categories such as shopping, entertainment, food expenses, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For each expense category, it displays:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Status (indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
This section presents all tracked expenses in a monthly format, with months clearly categorized, allowing for an at-a-glance view of expenditures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
Similar to the monthly overview, the yearly overview provides the same financial information but aggregated and presented in an annual format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Summary Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
The summary offers a complete financial overlook in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to provide a comprehensive view of overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Data Input: The Expense Details Database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
To populate these overviews, users enter all financial information into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This is crucial for [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]] and calculating daily incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Entering Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
Transactions are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

7.  Add an expense code, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

After booking expenses, users can [[using_notion_to_analyze_financial_data | analyze financial data]] further by interacting with the overviews:

### Drilling Down into Periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
Clicking on a "period" (e.g., Feb 2024) opens a new window showing:
*   All transactions for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   Details of the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>

### Drilling Down into Years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
Clicking on a "year" provides a similar detailed view for the entire year, including:

### Using Expense Codes for Granular Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
The expense code allows users to see how much has been booked for a particular expense category within a specific month, compared to the total budget for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This detailed tracking makes it a powerful tool for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances in Notion]].

The primary dashboard for a Notion bills tracker provides a comprehensive overview of financial obligations and payments. It is organized into several key sections to help users manage their bills effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section presents a quick snapshot of bill statuses, divided into three subsections:

*   **Upcoming Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>
    This subsection displays all bills that are yet to be paid. It includes the amount due, the due date of the bill, the number of days remaining until the due date, and the current payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Clicking on a bill's status updates it to "paid," which then moves the bill to the "Bills Paid" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Past Due Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>
    This area highlights bills that have passed their due date. It shows the expense amount, the original due date, the number of days past due, and the current payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Bills Paid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>
    This section lists all bills that have been successfully paid on time, showing the amount, due date, and status of the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Bills Distribution Sections

The dashboard also features several sections for distributing and analyzing bills based on different criteria:

*   **By Priority** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>
    Bills are classified by priority: low, medium, or high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This section displays the incurred expenses for each priority level and the percentage of bills paid within each respective head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   **By Category** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>
    Bills are categorized into six main types: entertainment, food and groceries, utility bills, travel and transportation, loans and debts, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Each category shows the total amount paid and the percentage of bills paid within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **By Period** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>
    Bills are distributed based on their payment frequency: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, annually, and one-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. For each period, the dashboard reflects the budgeted expenses, actual expenses, the change observed between them, upcoming bills, the number of bills paid, and the percentage of bills paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

The data presented on the primary dashboard is primarily derived from a main "Bills Database" and several supplemental databases, with information often "rolled up" using Notion's relational properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This dashboard functions as the central hub for managing and visualizing bill payments in Notion.

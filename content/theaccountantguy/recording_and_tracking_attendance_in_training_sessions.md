The employee training expenses tracker includes a training dashboard that offers two primary views for monitoring and managing employee training and [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | attendance]] records: the training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows for comprehensive [[how_to_use_notion_for_employee_training_tracking | employee training tracking]] and expense management.

## Training Overview

The training overview provides a summary of all scheduled trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each individual training, the following details are displayed:
*   **Training Date** The date when employees were scheduled to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Employees Count** Indicates the number of employees expected to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Percentage of [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Attendance]]** Shows the proportion of employees who actually attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Training [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | Expense]]** The cost associated with each training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

All this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Employee Records

The employee records section lists individual employees, categorized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This section provides a quick overview of each employee's training engagement:
*   **Total Number of Trainings Attended** Reflects how many trainings an employee has completed out of the total scheduled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, "Steve" might show attending two out of three trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Percentage of [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Attendance]]** An individual percentage indicating an employee's training attendance rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Next Training Date** Users can specify the next training date for an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Days Remaining** Automatically calculates the number of days until the next scheduled training from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

[[adding_and_managing_employee_records | Employee records]] can be added or edited, and employees can be moved between departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Expense Overview

On the left side of the dashboard, an [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expenses]] overview section details the total incurred expenses for all trainings, the number of trainings conducted, the total number of employees registered, and the average [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expense]] per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This information automatically updates as [[transaction_tracking_and_management | transaction details]] are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Managing Training and Employee Records

Below the main dashboard, there are three detailed views for managing data: training records, [[adding_and_managing_employee_records | employee details]], and training [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Employee Details

This section allows for the [[adding_and_managing_employee_records | addition]] and editing of [[adding_and_managing_employee_records | employee records]] by department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. New employees can be added using a quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Training Records

The training record section displays all training sessions attended by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Users can:
*   **Set Training Dates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Add Training Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Select Employees** Assign specific employees to a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Update [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Attendance]]** Use a checkbox to indicate if assigned employees have attended a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For example, if three employees are assigned to "Training One", checking boxes for two of them will update the [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | attendance]] to 67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Unchecking will adjust the percentage accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Tag Multiple Employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Training Expenses

This section allows for the editing of [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expense]] information for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Changes automatically update the overall [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expense]] overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The view can be switched to a table format for easier editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Customization

The dashboard allows for currency changes in the [[calculating_and_editing_training_expenses | expense]] fields by editing the number format property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Currency signs in dashboard formulas are also customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

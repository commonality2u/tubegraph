A business cash flow template offers a comprehensive way to [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | track]] and manage a business's financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool provides a quick overview of cash movements, helps in setting up accounts, and categorizes business activities for better financial insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template features a cash flow overview section on the left, summarizing key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Opening Balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   **Total Inflow** (cash received from all transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Total Outflow** (cash spent on all transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Closing Balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These balances automatically update as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Account Management

The "Account" section allows users to set up and manage different financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Accounts are categorized under various heads, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

*   **Assets:** Such as cash, bank accounts, receivables, and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Users can add new assets or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance:** The starting balance of an asset when using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   **Classifications:** Define how specific items are categorized (e.g., a credit card as a debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. New classifications can be added or existing ones edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency:** Specifies how often payments are received for an item, useful for income and expenses (e.g., quarterly interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units:** Relevant for inventory or investments (e.yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]g., 10 units of inventory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Asset Class:** Used for inventory (inventory asset class) or investments (investment asset class) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

The same principles for adding and editing items apply across all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The "Quarterly Overview" section provides a monthly summary of cash flow movement, broken down into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For each month within a quarter, it displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
*   **Inflow:** Cash coming into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Outflow:** Cash going out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Net Balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

These figures automatically update as transactions are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Business Activity Categories

The "Business Activity" section classifies cash flow based on the nature of the activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   **Operating Activities:** Relate to the core operations of the business, such as salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Investing Activities:** Involve investments made by the business, like stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Financing Activities:** Pertain to raising funds (loans, debt) or loan repayments for business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Each category shows its respective inflow, outflow, and net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

The template supports entering various types of transactions through different views: Income, Expense, Asset, Liability, Investments, and Inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

2.  **Date:** Can be changed using a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
3.  **Period:** Specify the month and year (e.g., January 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
4.  **Description:** Describe the income (e.g., "sales revenue") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
5.  **Account:** Select the relevant income account (e.g., "sales revenue account") from previously set up accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

7.  **Amount:** Enter the monetary value of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
8.  **Type:** Categorize the cash flow under Operating, Investing, or Financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Sales revenue typically falls under "Operating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
9.  **Transaction Type:** Indicates cash flow direction. Income transactions are "Inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Expenses are "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. For asset/liability transactions, assess if cash is coming in (inflow) or going out (outflow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
10. **Documents:** Option to attach relevant documents like sales receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Managing Investments and Inventory

*   **Investments:** In the "Investments" section, users can specify units and prices of investments purchased or sold (e.g., Apple stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This allows for tracking investment value and calculating profit/loss on sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Inventory:** The "Inventory" section allows tracking total inventory value, units, and prices for both purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This helps in automatically calculating profit or loss on inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

If figures don't update immediately, clicking on a sum or balance field and re-selecting "sum" or "balance" can refresh the calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

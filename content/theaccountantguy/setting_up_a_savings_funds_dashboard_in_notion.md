The [[Creating a Sinking Funds Tracker in Notion | savings funds dashboard]] in Notion provides a comprehensive overview of your savings targets and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is designed with two primary views: the "Savings Target" and the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Dashboard Components

*   **Savings Target**: This section allows you to define different saving funds and set their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview**: This view provides a summary of your total savings, showing how much has been saved against the set targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Transactions Panel**: Located at the bottom, this panel is where you record individual savings transactions, which then update the overall savings figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Managing Savings Targets

The Savings Target section comes with three default savings entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

You can modify any existing saving fund's name or goal amount:
1.  **Direct Editing**: Click on the pencil button next to the savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
    *   Rename the fund (e.g., changing "Emergency Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   Adjust the goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Changes made here will automatically update the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Detailed Editing**: Click anywhere on the savings fund entry itself to open a detailed view with all editable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. From here, you can edit the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings goal:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon for the new entry to give it a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  Set the desired goal amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

If you need to remove a savings fund:
1.  Click the six dots that appear on the left side of the specific saving fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

The "Transactions Panel" at the bottom is crucial for inputting savings contributions.

### Adding New Transactions

1.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will automatically be added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   Transactions are grouped by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  You can change the date by clicking on the date field and selecting a new date from the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "Saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund this transaction contributes to (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
5.  Enter the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Automatic Updates

As soon as you add an amount to a transaction, the corresponding saving fund's total in the "Savings Overview" will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This includes recalculating the percentage of the targeted amount achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Customization

### Currency

The currency used in the tracker can be changed:
1.  Click on any amount field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Click "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
3.  Under "Number Format," you can select from various currencies supported by Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Transaction Grouping

The transaction view can be dynamically changed to group transactions by different time periods:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the transaction view title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Go to "Group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  Select "Date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
4.  Choose to group by "Month" (default), "Week," or "Year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This will alter how your savings history is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This [[Creating a Sinking Funds Tracker in Notion | savings funds tracker]] is fully dynamic and customizable to fit individual preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

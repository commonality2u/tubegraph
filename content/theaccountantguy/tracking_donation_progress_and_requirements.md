This article explains how to utilize a charity donation tracker to manage and monitor all your contributions towards various charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your donation funds, recent transactions, and overall progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Tracker Structure

The charity donation tracker is organized into three main sections in its "Donation Funds Overview":
*   Fund Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Donations Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Additionally, it includes detailed sections for "Recent Donations" and a "Quarterly Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section allows you to define and manage the charitable funds you wish to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Categories
Donations are initially divided into broad categories such as Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These existing categories can be edited, or new categories can be added by using a slider and a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Funds
Under each category, you can set up specific funds like American Red Cross, WHO, Care funds (under Health); Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, The Rainforest Foundation (under Environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

To add a new fund:
1.  Click the "add funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Once created, it appears without classification; use the three dots to move it to an existing category (e.g., Education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon to edit fund details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Fund details include:
*   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Opening balance**: The amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted donation**: The desired donation amount for this specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Start date**: When you began donating to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Target date**: The end goal date by when you aim to achieve the targeted donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Funds can also be deleted by clicking the three-dot icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Recent Donations

The "Recent Donations" section provides a chronological, month-wise split of all your donations, with the latest months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

For each donation entry, you can record:
*   **Date**: When the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. New periods can be created as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Select the specific fund from your established list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

A "Recommended" figure is displayed, indicating the monthly contribution needed from the start date to reach the targeted donation amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This figure helps estimate how much to contribute each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

In the "Amount" section, you input the actual donation made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. A checkmark appears if your contribution exceeds or meets the "Recommended" amount, while a crossmark indicates a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This provides a quick visual cue on whether you are contributing enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

New donation entries can be added automatically with the current date by clicking the "add donation" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The "Quarterly Overview" section provides a summary of all donations categorized by quarter (Q1: January-March, Q2: April-June, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

For each month within a quarter, it shows:
*   Total donations made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Donation requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   Percentage of requirement met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Color coding indicates progress:
*   **Red**: Donation is falling short of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Green**: Enough donations have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Blue**: The total donation is equal to the donation requirement, or no donations have been made for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Total donations for the entire quarter are also calculated and displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Donations Overview (Fund-Specific)

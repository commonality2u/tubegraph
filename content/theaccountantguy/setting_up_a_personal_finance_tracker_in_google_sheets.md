A personal finance tracker in Google Sheets allows users to monitor their income and expenses using a spreadsheet format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This tool is designed to help track financial details and provide analysis of spending and earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Structure

The personal finance tracker spreadsheet is typically organized into three main tabs, in addition to an initial instruction tab:
*   **Start Here**: Provides all necessary instructions for using the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Budget**: Used to define income and expense accounts and set financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Transactions**: Where individual income and expense transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Dashboard**: Displays an analytical overview of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Budget Tab Configuration

The first step in setting up the tracker is to configure the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
1.  **Feed Account Details**: Input details for all income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Specify Monthly Amounts**: Assign a budgeted amount for each account for each month, whether it's for expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Categorization**: Categorize each account as either "Income" or "Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
4.  **Goal Amount Column**: The "Goal Amount" column automatically calculates the total for each account across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If new line items are added, the formula in this column needs to be dragged down to cover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
5.  **Adding Rows**: Users can add new rows to the tab by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Transactions Tab Usage

After setting up accounts and budget estimations in the Budget tab, transactions can be added to the Transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
1.  **Enter Transaction Details**: For each transaction, record the date, a description of the transaction, and select its category from the accounts set up in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Income/Expense Identification**: Column E automatically identifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This formula should be dragged down for new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Specify Amount**: Input the monetary amount for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Dashboard Section for Analysis

The Dashboard section provides a comprehensive financial overview and analysis of all added income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This section can be customized using various filters:
*   **Category**: Filter by specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Period**: Select a specific time frame, such as an entire year (e.g., 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Reference**: Choose the type of financial data to view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Dashboard Components:
*   **Summary View**: Displays total income, total expense, and the net balance for the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Income Overview**: Details different sources of income for the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Users can customize the view on the Dashboard to analyze specific details, such as total income for a period or an individual source of income like "salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This flexibility allows for detailed financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

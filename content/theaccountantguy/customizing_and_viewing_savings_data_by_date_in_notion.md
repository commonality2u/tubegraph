The Notion savings funds tracker features a dashboard with two primary views: the "Savings Target" and the "Savings Overview." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> The "Savings Target" view allows users to set specific saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of savings progress, showing how much has been saved relative to the targeted amounts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

## Managing Savings Funds

### Editing Existing Savings Targets
To modify an existing savings fund, click the pencil icon next to its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> or click directly on the fund entry to open all options. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> From here, you can rename the saving fund, for example, changing it to "car fund," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> and adjust the goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> Any changes made are automatically reflected in the savings overview. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

### Adding New Savings Targets
New savings funds can be added by clicking the "add savings" button. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> This action automatically creates a new entry, typically with a default goal amount of $1,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> Users can then rename the fund (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and set a desired goal amount, such as $10,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

### Deleting Savings Funds
To delete a savings fund, click the six dots located on the left side of the entry and select the "delete" option. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>

## Tracking and Viewing Savings Transactions

### Adding Savings Transactions
The "transactions panel" at the bottom of the dashboard is used to add new savings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
1.  Click "add transaction." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
2.  A new transaction is automatically added with the current system date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
3.  Click on the entry to set a different date using the calendar. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
4.  Enter details for the transaction, such as "saving for car fund." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
5.  Select the relevant saving fund (e.g., "car fund") from the "saving fund" column. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
6.  Input the saved amount; this will automatically update the total savings for that fund in the "Savings Overview." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

### Customizing Data Views by Date
The transaction view is dynamically grouped by month by default, with the most recent months appearing at the top. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> To change this grouping:
1.  Click the three dots within the transactions panel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
2.  Select "Grouping." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
3.  Click on "date" to reveal options for grouping by:
    *   **Month** (default) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   **Week** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
    *   **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
Changing this setting will dynamically adjust how your savings transactions are displayed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

### Currency Customization
The Notion savings tracker allows for the use of different currencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> To change the currency, click on any amount field (e.g., with a dollar currency), select "Edit property," and then choose the desired number format from the list of Notion-supported currencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

This tracker is fully dynamic and customizable to suit individual needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> For assistance with [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | setting up the template]] in a different currency or any other questions, users can reach out for support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

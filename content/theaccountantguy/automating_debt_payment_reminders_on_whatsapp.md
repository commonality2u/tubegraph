Sanam Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guide, demonstrates how to [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | set up debt payment reminders]] that arrive as [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] notifications [00:00:05] [00:00:08]. These reminders alert users on the due date of a loan payment [00:00:10].

## How it Works

The system sends a [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp notification]] on the due date of a loan payment [00:00:10].

> [!example] Car Loan Reminder
> A typical message might state: "Hi there this is a reminder for payment of car loan which is due on September 23 for an amount of three thousand dollars" [00:00:26].
>
> These messages can also include a [[integration_of_pay_now_links_in_whatsapp_notifications | payment link]], such as a "pay now" button [00:00:34]. Clicking this button redirects the user to their bank portal or a service like PayPal, enabling instant loan repayment [00:00:39] [00:00:46]. Any relevant payment link can be added [00:00:51].

The messages are completely modifiable and can be used for various purposes [00:00:56] [00:01:02].

## [[steps_for_scheduling_payment_reminders_with_repetition | Setting up Payment Reminders with Repetition]]

To receive [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | debt payment reminders]] on [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp]], the first step is to create a [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] for each loan [00:01:07] [00:01:12].

### Creating a Template

1.  Click on the "new template" option from a dropdown [00:01:32] [00:01:34].
2.  Input loan details, such as "car loan" and the repayment amount (e.g., three thousand dollars) [00:01:36] [00:01:38] [00:01:40].

### Configuring Repetition

Once a new [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] is added, there is an option to set its repetition [00:01:48] [00:01:50] [00:01:52]. Repetition automatically populates all values within the [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] for a specific period [00:01:54].

*   **Frequency:** Users can set the repetition on a monthly basis, meaning the information will appear each month [00:02:01] [00:02:03] [00:02:05].
*   **Day and Time:** Specify a particular day of the month (e.g., the 16th) and a specific time for the reminder to occur [00:02:08] [00:02:10] [00:02:16]. This ensures that the line item automatically gets added to the database on that recurring date [00:02:24] [00:02:27].

### Adjusting Notification Timing

The system allows customization of when the [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | notification]] is received relative to the actual due date [00:02:37].

*   **Early Notification:** To receive a [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | notification]] a certain number of days *before* the due date, specify the number of days (e.g., 7 days) [00:02:44] [00:02:49] [00:02:53]. For instance, if the due date is September 23rd, and 7 days are set, the reminder will be sent on September 16th [00:02:38] [00:03:03].
*   **On Due Date Notification:** To receive the [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | notification]] on the exact due date, simply set the "days before" value to 0 [00:03:10] [00:03:14].

## Automation and Scalability

Once a recurring [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] is set for each loan, such as a car loan, it will repeat every month on the specified date [00:03:26] [00:03:30] [00:03:31]. This repetition automatically triggers an automation that sends the [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | debt payment notification]] message to your [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] [00:03:37] [00:03:39] [00:03:41].

This system can be automated for any number of loans [00:05:00] [00:05:35]. As new loans are automatically added based on the [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] schedule, a [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | payment alert]] is triggered on [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] [00:04:07] [00:04:09] [00:04:42] [00:04:45] [00:05:16] [00:05:18].

> [!info] Customization
> Users can also create a custom message as per their specific needs, making the reminders fully [[customizing_and_automating_loan_repayment_notifications | customizable]] [00:04:47] [00:05:47] [00:05:50].

## Managing Reminders

Once a loan has been repaid, users can simply delete the corresponding [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] to prevent further recurring notifications [00:06:03] [00:06:04] [00:06:06] [00:06:07].

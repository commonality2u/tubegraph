Sanat Biswal, known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to [[setting_up_bills_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | set up bills payment reminders on WhatsApp]] that recur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An example of a reminder displayed shows a Wi-Fi bill for $3,000 due on September 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the bill, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, for instance, $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Configuring Recurring Reminders

To set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis:
1.  Click on the dropdown menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Choose the recurrence frequency (e.g., "every month") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day for the notification to be received (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This setup will cause the reminder to repeat monthly on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation and Notifications

This recurring reminder system utilizes automation, specifically with the help of Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for setting up the entire automation workflow in Pabbly Connect is included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once the automation is configured and a template is set for recurring payments, notifications will be automatically sent to your WhatsApp every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For instance, if a Mobile bill was set for 11:55 AM on September 20th, it would automatically be added and a notification would be sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Notifications are delivered quickly, usually within a minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

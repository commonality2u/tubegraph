This article discusses how to track [[personal_finance_tracker | personal finances]] and financial goals using a Notion-based setup, focusing on [[tracking_savings_and_net_worth | net worth tracking]]. The tracker allows users to specify net worth targets, manage accounts, and view financial summaries at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## [[structure_of_a_net_worth_tracker | Structure of a Net Worth Tracker]]
The Notion-based financial tracker is organized into several key sections:
*   **Net Worth Target** Users can set a financial year target for their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section** This is where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified, including opening balances, payment frequencies, and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Provides an overview of finances, including debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** All transactions related to income, expenses, assets, or liabilities are fed into this section, affecting all other views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The tracker aims to help users track everything from income and expenses to [[tracking_assets_liabilities_and_net_worth_in_a_business | net worth valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses
The first step in [[tracking_personal_finances_for_beginners | tracking personal finances]] involves setting up income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Account Setup
Under the "Account" section, users can define income sources (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expense categories (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Accounts can be modified by clicking an edit button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   New income or expense accounts can be added via a "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   Expenses can be classified into categories like "bills," "subscriptions," or "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   Payment frequencies (e.g., monthly, annually) can be set for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Income and expense accounts generally do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Transaction Entry
Transactions are entered in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   There are five transaction views: "all" (for all categories) and specific views for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   When entering a transaction:
    *   Select the date, which automatically groups transactions by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   Link to the relevant income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   Specify the payment mode (bank or cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Set the transaction type as "inflow" for income (money coming in) or "outflow" for expenses (money going out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Summary Overview

*   It shows the total amount earned or incurred for each income or expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   Percentages indicate the contribution of each category to the total income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Changes in transaction amounts are quickly reflected in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Debt Tracking
Tracking debt involves setting up liability accounts and recording payments.

### Account Setup
Under the "Account" section, navigate to "Liabilities" to add or modify debt accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

*   For debt repayments, the transaction type is "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   If taking on a new loan, the transaction type would be "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   The total loan amount and repayment amounts are updated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Summary Overview
The "Debt" section in the "Summary" view shows upcoming and past debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Upcoming payments**: Debts due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## [[tracking_savings_goals_with_a_sinking_funds_tracker | Tracking Savings Goals with a Sinking Funds Tracker]]
The tracker enables setting up specific funds for savings and monitoring progress.

### Account Setup
Savings funds are set up as "assets" in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   Create a new asset account (e.g., "Education Fund," "Car Fund") and classify it as "savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   Specify a "goal amount" for each savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This goal amount will be reflected in the savings summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### Transaction Entry
Transactions for savings are added under the "Asset" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   When saving, the money is typically flowing *out* of a main account (e.g., bank) and *into* the savings fund, so it's recorded as an "outflow" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   The amount saved is entered, and the progress towards the goal amount is updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Bill Management
Bills are tracked similarly to other expenses with specific categories and payment statuses.

### Account Setup
Bills are set up as expense accounts under the "Account" section, classified as "bills" with a set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

### Transaction Entry
Bill payments are entered under the "Expense" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   Enter the date, description, account, payment mode, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   Transaction type is "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Summary Overview
The "Bills" section in the "Summary" displays upcoming and past bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Upcoming payments**: Bills due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Past payments**: Bills that were due in the past and might indicate missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   The view automatically updates based on the last payment date and the set frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

## Subscription Tracking
Subscriptions are a specific type of bill that can also be tracked.

### Account Setup
Subscription accounts are set up under "Expenses" in the "Account" section, classified as "subscriptions" with a defined payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Transaction Entry
Subscription payments are added to the "Expense" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   Similar to bills, payments are recorded as "outflow" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

### Summary Overview
The "Subscription" view in the "Summary" section shows upcoming and past subscription payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
*   It indicates the next due date based on the last payment and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   Users can easily see if any subscription payments are due or missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
*   A "subscription status" can be set for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Net Worth Calculation and Goals
The core of the tracker is to calculate and monitor net worth.

### Setting a Net Worth Goal
Users first set a net worth target for the financial year in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This target can be easily adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### Net Worth Overview
The "Net Worth" section under the "Summary" view provides a complete overview of the [[monthly_net_worth_overview | monthly net worth overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   **Difference to Goal**: Shows how much the user is "lagging behind" their set net worth target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved**: Represents the total net worth divided by the net worth goal, showing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: Calculates the growth from the opening net worth (sum of opening asset balances minus opening liability balances) to the current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Tracking Investments (FAQ)
The tracker includes a section for monitoring investments such as stocks and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### Investment Account Setup
Investment accounts are set up as "assets" in the "Account" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   Specify an opening balance and opening units if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
*   Classify the investment (e.g., "stocks," "crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
*   Crucially, set the "asset class" property to "Investments" for proper calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

### Transaction Entry for Investments
Investment transactions are recorded under the "Asset" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Purchases**: Always record the investment at its *cost price* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales**: When selling an investment, record the *cost value* of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This allows the tracker to correctly compute profit or loss on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

### Investment Summary
The "Investment" tab shows the total investment amount, number of units, and the profit or loss from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. It also displays the investment percentage, showing the proportion of each investment within the total investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

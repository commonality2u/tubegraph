The [[introduction_to_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] is designed to assist [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion]] users who have difficulty finding the correct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This chatbot aims to help users derive the exact [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] they need when [[using_formulas_in_notion | using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Getting Started with the Chatbot

Before interacting with the chatbot, users must input their OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Generating an OpenAI API Key
To generate an OpenAI API key:
1.  Click on the question mark icon in the chatbot interface, which will provide a link to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  Once redirected, navigate to "Open API Keys" on the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  Fill in the details (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  **Crucially, copy the generated key immediately**, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
6.  Paste this key into the designated field in the chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A message confirming the API key entry will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

New OpenAI accounts typically receive a $5 free credit, which can be used for testing the chatbot with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Selecting a GPT Model
After entering the API key, users can select their preferred GPT model from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Two models are available:
*   **GPT-3.5 Turbo:** This is an older model and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It is suitable for testing on a free plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The demonstration video was entirely tested using GPT-3.5 Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT-4-106 Preview:** This model offers better and more accurate results for prompts and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It is recommended for users on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Interacting with the Chatbot

The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections: Info, Chat, and Give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Chat Section
In the chat section, users can start interacting with the bot by typing messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The chatbot can provide [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion]]-[[using_formulas_in_notion | related formulas]] and explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

**Examples of Formula Generation:**
*   **Adding Two Numbers:** When asked "What is the [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] to add two numbers in [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion]]?", the chatbot responded with `property A + property B` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Time Difference Between Dates:** For finding the difference between a birth date and today's date in years, the chatbot suggested using the `dateBetween` [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **IF Condition:** When prompted for an `IF` condition (e.g., if number one is greater than number two, output number one, otherwise output number two), the chatbot provided the correct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] and explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The chatbot provides instant responses and explanations for the [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For more complex questions, better prompting, including examples or references, may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Additional Features

*   **Image Option:** Users can upload an image, which will update the user's display icon within the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This is an optional feature for personalizing the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Clicking the cross icon will revert to the original user image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Clear Chat History:** A "Clear Chat History" button is available to reset the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

For feedback or issues, users can contact `notionformyuse@gmail.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Give Section

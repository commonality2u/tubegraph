A monthly budget planner in Notion can be utilized for [[Expense Tracking in Notion | expense tracking]] and budgeting for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system features several different views to help users understand their financial situation.

## Main Views of the Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner includes four primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

1.  **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>: This view provides a summary of different expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. For each category, it shows the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
2.  **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>: All expenses are displayed in a monthly format, with months categorized to allow a quick glance at expenses for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
3.  **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>: Similar to the monthly overview, but presents the information in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
4.  **Summary of All Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: This section offers a complete [[Tracking income and expenses in Notion | expense overlook]] in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to provide an overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Expense Details Database

To use the planner, all expense information is entered into the `expense details database` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database helps calculate daily expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. All expenses are categorized by month, with months sorted in descending order (later months appearing at the top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

To add a new transaction:
1.  Click on "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024), which will automatically adjust to the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024"). Users can add new periods if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

8.  Input the expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The "budget amount" column is used at the start of the month to set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

4.  Choose the category (e.g., "food"). For budgets, the expense name and category name remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
5.  Set the expense code to reflect the category and month/year (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  Input the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data Through Views

After booking all expenses, the data can be analyzed through various views to gain insights into financial performance. This is helpful for [[Using Notion for personal and business expense tracking | personal and business expense tracking]].

*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including details like amount and whether it's a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Similarly, clicking on a year shows a comprehensive view including budgeted amount, expenses amount, expenses as a percentage, budget status, and all transactions for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This is useful for [[Business expense tracking with Notion | business expense tracking with Notion]].
*   **Category View**: This view displays how much expense has been booked for a particular category, showing the expense amount, budgeted amount, expenses as a percentage, and status. It also lists category-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. [[Credit card expenses tracking in Notion | Credit card expenses tracking in Notion]] can also be done using this view by categorizing them appropriately.
*   **Expense Code View**: This allows users to see how much has been booked for a specific category of expense for a particular month compared to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views make it easy to track finances, allowing users to understand their progress throughout the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> and helping them with [[Using Notion for Expense Management | expense management]] and [[Creating a Notion expense tracker | creating a Notion expense tracker]].

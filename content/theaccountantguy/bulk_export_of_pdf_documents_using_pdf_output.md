[[generating_and_exporting_pdf_documents_for_business | PDF Output]] is a tool designed to [[using_pdf_output_for_document_generation | create PDF documents for business]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[03:09]</a>. It allows users to [[customizing_and_exporting_pdf_documents | customize and export PDF documents]] based on various templates, such as invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23">[03:23]</a>.

## Bulk Export Mode

Beyond [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents | generating individual PDF documents]], [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF Output]] offers a bulk export mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40">[04:40]</a>. This feature enables users to [[steps_for_downloading_and_exporting_pdfs | export multiple PDF documents]] simultaneously by filling in a database within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>.

### Process for Bulk Generation

1.  **Switch to Bulk Export Mode**: Click on the "bulk export mode" option within the [[setting_up_pdfoutput_for_document_generation | PDF Output]] interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>.
2.  **Fill the Database**: Input the necessary details into the provided database table. The fields in this database correspond to those found in the single PDF mode, such as invoice number, invoice date, and other relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28">[05:28]</a>.
3.  **Generate PDFs**: Once the database is filled, click "Download all PDF" to start generating PDF documents one by one, based on the information provided in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>.

### Output and Features

*   **Format Consistency**: PDFs generated in bulk mode maintain the same format as those created individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[05:57]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization**: The currency selected (e.g., Euro) will automatically be reflected in the generated bulk PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>.
*   **Individual Row Export**: Users can also choose to [[exporting_and_downloading_pdfs | download a PDF for a specific individual row]] from the database, even when in bulk mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>.

### Future Developments

The platform currently supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>. Future plans include integrating with Notion databases, allowing users to add details in Notion and export documents directly through [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF Output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10">[06:10]</a>.

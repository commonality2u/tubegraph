PDF Output offers various features and subscription options to manage PDF document generation.

## Subscription Tiers and Watermarks

Under the free plan, exported documents will include a "Made with PDF output Watermark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31">[07:31]</a>. Users can remove this watermark and eliminate limits on PDF document generation by upgrading to any of the available subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[07:34]</a>. After choosing a plan, the subscription needs to be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38">[07:38]</a>. This falls under [[pdf_output_software_features_and_upgrades | PDF output software features and upgrades]].

## Core Features and Settings

PDF Output provides several features and settings for [[managing_pdfoutput_settings_and_subscriptions | managing PDF output settings and subscriptions]]:

*   **Page Format** By default, the page format for generated PDFs is set to A4 for correct paging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49">[07:49]</a>. This can be found under the "Settings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48">[07:48]</a>.
*   **Adding Multiple Databases and Templates** After the initial database and template are added, additional databases and templates can be integrated via the "Settings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[07:54]</a>.
*   **Managing Existing Connections** The "Connections" option on the right sidebar displays previously created connections, such as a "purchase order" connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>. Clicking on a connection automatically loads the associated database and template in the first step of the generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09">[07:09]</a>. This eliminates the need to re-enter database and template information each time documents are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>.
*   **Custom Templates** Users can create and use [[custom_pdf_document_solutions | custom templates]] from scratch, rather than relying on predefined ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>. Instructions for this are available in the "Help" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a>.
*   **Mobile Interface** The interface can be minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>. On mobile or smaller devices, a "T icon" is visible, which can be clicked to start generating documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50">[08:50]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Relational Database Access** If using relation properties within a Notion database, it is crucial to grant access to all related databases when connecting to PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>. This ensures that all elements are correctly reflected in the generated PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17">[09:17]</a>.
*   **Feedback and Support** Users can provide feedback or report difficulties and issues through the dedicated "Feedback" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a>. Direct assistance is available by reaching out via email at notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26">[09:26]</a>.

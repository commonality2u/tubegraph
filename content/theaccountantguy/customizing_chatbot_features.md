The [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] is designed for Notion users who find it challenging to create formulas for specific use cases. It helps users derive the exact formulas they need within Notion [00:00:04].

## Getting Started: API Key and GPT Model

Before interacting with the chatbot, users must place their OpenAI API key and select a GPT model [00:00:16].

### Generating an OpenAI API Key
To begin using the chatbot, an OpenAI API key is required [00:00:18].
*   Click the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find the link for generating an OpenAI API key [00:04:05].
*   This link redirects to the OpenAI platform [00:04:11].
*   On the OpenAI platform, locate and click on "Open API Keys" in the left-hand navigation [00:04:17].
*   Select "Create new secret key" [00:04:21].
*   Fill in the necessary details and click "Create secret key" [00:04:25].
*   **Important:** Immediately copy the generated key, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed [00:04:41].
*   Paste this copied key into the designated area in the chatbot window [00:04:51]. A message will confirm that the API key has been entered, allowing you to proceed [00:04:57].

**Note on Free Credit:**
When you create an OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit which can be used to test the chatbot [00:05:06]. This free credit is generally limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model [00:05:13].

### Selecting a GPT Model
After entering the API key, you need to select a GPT model [00:00:30]. The chatbot offers two models via a dropdown menu:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo:** This is an older model and is less accurate compared to GPT-4 [00:05:43]. It is available for free accounts and was used for the demonstration [00:06:00].
*   **GPT 4 (106 preview):** This model offers better and more accurate results, especially with complex prompts [00:05:55]. It is available for users on OpenAI's paid plans [00:05:49].

## Interacting with the Chatbot
The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections: **Info**, **Chat**, and **Give** [00:00:37]. Users primarily interact with the bot in the **Chat** section [00:00:42].

### Basic Formula Queries
Users can start by typing simple messages, such as "Hi" [00:00:45]. The chatbot will generate an immediate response [00:00:51].
Examples of formula-related questions and responses:
*   **Adding Two Numbers:** Asking "What is the formula to add two numbers in Notion?" yields the response `property A + property B`, explaining that Property A and B are the input numbers [00:01:00].
*   **Time Difference Between Dates:** When asked for the formula to find the difference in years between a birth date and today's date, the chatbot provides the `dateBetween` formula, specifying the use of "years" for the unit [00:01:58].
*   **IF Condition:** For a more complex query like "If number one is greater than number two, I want to generate number one as the output; otherwise, I want to generate number two as the output," the chatbot fluently provides the correct IF condition formula and a detailed explanation [00:03:08].

### Prompting Tips
The chatbot responds instantly and provides explanations along with formulas [00:02:22]. For more precise results, the chatbot sometimes requires better prompting, such as giving proper examples or references to what you are trying to accomplish [00:03:38].

## Chatbot Interface and Customization Options

### Sections of the Chatbot
The chatbot is divided into three panels:
*   **Info Section:** Contains details related to the chatbot, including an embedded video explanation [00:08:35]. It also provides contact information for feedback or issues (notionformyuse@gmail.com) [00:08:43].
*   **Chat Section:** The primary area for user interaction [00:08:49].
*   **Give Section:** Allows users to donate to support product improvement [00:09:07].

### User Icon Customization
The user icon displayed next to your questions can be customized [00:06:17].
*   You can upload an image from your files [00:06:28].
*   Once uploaded, the user icon will update to your chosen image, adding a personalized touch to your interactions [00:06:42].
*   Clicking the cross icon will revert the user image back to its original default [00:06:58].

### Theme and Font Customization
The chatbot's appearance can be customized:
*   **Changing Color Theme:**
    *   Click the three dots on the right side of the window [00:07:30].
    *   Go to "Settings" [00:07:32].
    *   Under "App theme colors and font," click the dropdown menu [00:07:36].
    *   Choose between "Light" for a light background or "Dark" to return to the default dark theme [00:07:40].
    *   "System settings" allow for active theme editing and changing all colors to suit specific requirements [00:07:54].
*   **Changing Font Family:**
    *   Within the "Settings" menu, you can also change the font family [00:07:58].

### Clearing Chat History
In the **Chat** section, there is a "Clear chat history" button [00:08:53]. Clicking this will clear all past conversations and refresh the chat, starting a new interaction [00:08:57].

### Conversations Counter
The chatbot also includes a "conversations counter" which tracks the number of interactions you've had with the chatbot [00:09:03].

### Window Display
If the left panel (for API key and GPT model input) is not visible, click the arrow icon on the left side of the chat window to open it [00:08:11]. This is particularly useful for users on smartphones or other devices [00:08:22].

## Support and Donation
If you wish to support the development and improvement of the chatbot, you can click on the "Donate" button in the "Give" section [00:07:09]. For any feedback or issues, you can contact the developer at notionformyuse@gmail.com [00:08:43]. If any errors occur, simply click the "refresh" button to reset the chatbot [00:09:16].

This article details how to effectively manage and track personal finances, specifically focusing on income and expenses, using a developed Notion-based tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The system provides a comprehensive overview of financial activities, allowing users to gain insight into their financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Personal Finance Tracker Overview

The personal finance tracker features three main sections for financial management:
*   **Net Worth Target** Allows users to specify a net worth goal for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section** Where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are defined, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This section is crucial for [[setting_up_accounts_for_income_and_expenses | setting up accounts for income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Provides an at-a-glance view of all finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Additional sections within the tracker include debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and a net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. All financial activities are fed into a central [[tracking_and_managing_transactions_for_cash_flow | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts for Income and Expenses

To begin [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | tracking finances expenses and investments]], navigate to the `Account` section under the `Get Started` view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Here, you can define both income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Accounts
*   **Modifying Existing Accounts** Click the "edit" button next to an existing account to open a modification panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Adding New Accounts** Click the "new" button to set up a new income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

When creating a new account, specify the name, and for expenses, categorize them (e.g., Bills, Subscriptions) and set a payment frequency (e.g., Monthly, Annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

After [[setting_up_accounts_for_income_and_expenses | setting up accounts for income and expenses]], proceed to the `Transactions` view to input financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The transaction section offers five different views, including an "All" view and specific views for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Adding Income and Expense Transactions

9.  **Amount:** Enter the monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses

Once transactions are recorded, the `Summary` view under the `Finances` section provides a comprehensive overview of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Finances View
This view categorizes all accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, showing the total amount and percentage contribution of each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For example, it displays the total income earned from specific sources like salary and side hustles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Changes made in transaction amounts automatically update the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Budgeting
The `Budget` section within the `Summary` view allows users to [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_against_set_budgets | set up a budget]] for estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, and [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | track actuals against budgeted expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   It displays total incurred expenses and their percentage of the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   Users can modify budget amounts directly in this section, and the percentages will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Estimated income can also be tracked against actual earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This feature is key for [[managing_budget_and_actual_expenses | managing budget and actual expenses]].

### Detailed Tracking for Accounts
To view all transactions related to a specific income or expense account directly from the summary, click on the account name (e.g., Salary). A "View Transactions" option will appear, populating all associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

### Tracking Recurring Expenses (Bills & Subscriptions)
*   **Bills:** In the `Account` section under `Expenses`, bills can be classified and given a payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. The `Bills` section in the `Summary` view categorizes these into `Upcoming Payments` and `Past Payments`, similar to debt tracking, indicating payment due dates and any missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Subscriptions:** Similar to bills, subscriptions (e.g., Netflix) are classified under `Expenses` in the `Account` section, with an annual or monthly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The `Subscription` view in `Summary` also shows `Upcoming Payments` and `Past Payments`, along with subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

The net worth is calculated as the difference between assets and liabilities after all transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal:** Set a financial goal in the `Net Worth Goal` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Summary:** The `Net Worth` section under `Summary` displays the current net worth, the difference from the goal, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. It also shows total growth (closing net worth less opening net worth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## Investments

The tracker includes an `Investment` tab to track investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. Investments are classified as assets and recorded at cost price for purchases and cost value for sales to accurately reflect profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

## Application for Couples

This dashboard is also applicable for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities can be split and denoted per individual (e.g., "Salary by him," "Side Hustle by her") to track personal contributions within shared finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

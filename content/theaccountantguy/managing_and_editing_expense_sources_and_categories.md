A travel expense tracker helps users to [[managing_and_tracking_income_and_expenses | keep track of all travel expenses]] and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The system includes sections for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories and Sources

Initially, expenses are classified under broad categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Within these main categories, specific expense sources are created and [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted amounts]] are set for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources

To quickly [[modifying_and_adding_new_expense_categories_in_notion | add a new expense source]] within an existing category:
1.  Click on the "add expense source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This automatically adds a new source to the "Travel" category initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  [[modifying_and_adding_new_expense_categories_in_notion | Edit the details]] of the new expense source by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  Rename the source (e.g., "Metro") and set its [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted amount]] (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Moving Expense Sources Between Categories

An expense source can be moved to a different existing category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, to move an expense source to the "Meals" category, click on the three dots next to the source and select "Meals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The details can also be edited directly at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Categories (Groups)

To [[adding_or_deleting_categories_in_a_notion_expense_tracker | add a new category]] that is separate from existing ones (like "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging"):
1.  Click the plus sign on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  This prompts the user to "create a new group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Editing Existing Categories or Sources

*   **Editing an existing group (category)**: Click on the group name and begin [[modifying_and_adding_new_expense_categories_in_notion | editing its details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Editing an existing expense source**: Click the pencil icon next to the source to [[modifying_and_adding_new_expense_categories_in_notion | edit its details]], such as the name or [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting an expense source**: To [[adding_or_deleting_categories_in_a_notion_expense_tracker | delete an expense source]], the presenter briefly demonstrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Expense Tracking and Summary

Once expense accounts are [[creating_an_expense_categories_system | set up]], the "Expenses" section displays:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | Budgeted expense]] for that particular source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Percentage of actual spending relative to the [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Expenses exceeding the [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted amount]] are typically indicated in red, while those within budget are in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A "Summary" section provides an overview of all [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted expenses]], total incurred expenses, and the difference between them, along with a total percentage of spending against the overall budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | Adding and Categorizing Expenses]]

Expenses can be [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | booked]] under the three main categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Quick addition buttons are available for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

To [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | add an expense]]:
1.  Click on the relevant quick addition button (e.g., "Add travel expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  A new entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | Add a description]] and "trip info" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The trip info can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
4.  Select the specific account (expense source) for the expense (e.g., "Train" for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | booked]], the "Expenses" summary updates, reflecting the incurred amount against the [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted expense]] for that specific source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If no [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | budgeted expense]] was set for a source, it will not reflect ideal values until one is assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

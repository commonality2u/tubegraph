[[using_notion_to_track_product_orders | Tracking product orders]] in Notion can be streamlined using a simple template designed to [[using_notion_for_client_management | keep track of all products customers are ordering]] for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template helps [[organizing_resources_and_contacts_in_notion | organize customer data]] and order specifics efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Database Structure

The core of the template is a database that contains detailed information about each order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Payment Details**
    *   Payment sources (how the customer will pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Order amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   **Order Type**
    *   Indication if the product is a gift item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

## Order Summary and Analytics

At the top of the template, an order summary provides key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Number of Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers** who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Gift Recommendation Percentage**: This percentage indicates how many customers are ordering products as gift items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This value dynamically changes when details in the database are updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Payment Source Breakdown

The template also includes a section detailing payment sources, showing how many customers are paying through various methods like debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Each payment source reflects the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Customization

This template is fully customizable to meet specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Users can add additional metrics such as average order value or other necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The database can also be expanded to include more items and details as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This template is useful for [[using_notion_to_track_product_orders | tracking all product-related orders]] placed by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

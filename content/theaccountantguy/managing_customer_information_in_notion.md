A Notion template can be utilized as a product order tracker to help keep track of all products a customer is ordering for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template provides a database to manage various customer details.

## Key Customer Information Stored

The database includes specific fields for comprehensive customer tracking:
*   **Customer Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Billing Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Customer Phone Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Customer Email** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

## Order and Payment Tracking

Beyond basic contact details, the template also records information related to orders and payments:
*   **Payment Sources**: Specifies how the customer intends to pay, including options like debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Each payment source reflects the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Gift Items**: Indicates whether the product is intended as a gift item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A percentage indicator shows how many customers are looking to place orders as gift items (e.g., 67%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This percentage updates dynamically if values are changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Order Amount**: The total amount for the particular order placed by the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Order Summary and Analytics

At the top of the template, an order summary provides an overview of customer activity:
*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Number of Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers who Placed Orders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

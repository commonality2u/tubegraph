The business cash flow template offers functionalities to track and manage both business investments and [[inventory_classifications_and_management | inventory]]. This allows for a comprehensive overview of these asset classes within the broader financial management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Tracking Investments

The template allows users to specify and track various details related to business investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Adding and Viewing Investments
Users can add their own investments within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Examples include "Apple stock purchase" and "Apple stock sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
When navigating to the investment section, the template automatically displays the investments made, along with the units and price of each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Users can allocate their own units and prices, and the system will automatically pick up these values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Key Investment Details
*   **Units**: Quantity of investment units purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Price**: Price per unit of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Investment Value**: The price at which the stock or investment was purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Sale Value**: For sale transactions, users can enter the sale value of units and their price to show the total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Calculation**: The template automatically calculates profit or loss on both purchase and sale transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Classification of Investments
Investments are typically classified under the "investment asset class" within the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. They fall under [[operational_management_of_assets | investing activities]] in the business activity overview, which includes activities related to stock investments, mutual fund investments, and any other investments made for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The investment section provides an inflow, outflow, and net balance specific to these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Tracking Inventory

The template also allows for detailed tracking of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Setting Up Inventory
When initially setting up accounts, an "opening units" field is available, which is relevant for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For example, an opening unit of 10 and an opening balance of 1300 can be specified for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Key Inventory Details
When managing [[inventory_tracking_for_small_businesses | inventory]], users can specify:

*   **Sale Price**: The total value of inventory sold at its sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Classification of Inventory

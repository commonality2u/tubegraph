The employee schedule template is a tool designed to [[adding_and_managing_employee_records | keep track of employee schedules]] and performance within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This customizable template helps manage various aspects of employee information and work activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Template Views

The template is organized into four distinct views to provide a comprehensive overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
*   **Employee Details:** Lists all employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule:** Allows entry of tasks for employees based on specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Monthly View:** Shows monthly performance divided by quarters, including hours worked and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance:** Displays detailed performance information for individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Employee Details Section

This section is where new employees are added and their information is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Adding Employees:** New employees can be added by clicking "new" and entering details under relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A quick action button on top also allows automatic addition of a new employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Categories:** Examples of categories include Operations, Marketing, and Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. New categories can be added using the plus icon, and existing ones can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Information Captured:** When adding an employee, key details include their name, employee ID, contact information, department, position, and email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Task Schedule Section

Once employee details are entered, the task schedule section is used to assign and manage employee tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Shifts:** Tasks are organized into different shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Task Entry:** For each task, users can enter a desired start and end date/time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Employee Assignment:** Employees are assigned to tasks, with their respective departments automatically populated from the employee details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Hours Worked:** The template automatically computes the hours an employee has worked on a specific task based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **[[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Attendance and Task Status]]:** Employees can mark their attendance (present, on leave, day off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. They can also update the task status (in progress, completed, not started), or mark it as "not applicable" for days off or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Monthly View

This view provides an overview of employee hours over different months, divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   It displays the total hours worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   It also shows the total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   A combined total of working and leave hours is provided, offering a quick overview of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Employee Performance Section

For a more detailed look at individual contributions, the employee performance section shows the same information as the monthly view but broken down per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Users can see individual employee data for hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

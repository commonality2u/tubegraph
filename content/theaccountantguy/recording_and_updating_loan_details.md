This article demonstrates how to utilize a debt payment tracker to manage and pay off debts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system integrates various features to streamline debt tracking, including a comprehensive overview, customizable repayment categories, and automated progress updates.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debts and displays essential details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key information tracked for each debt includes:
*   **Debt Details**: The specific name or description of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount**: The total original amount of the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount**: The amount to be paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The specified interest rate for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first date an installment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date indicating when the debt will be fully paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Initially, debts are divided into categories like annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Customizing Repayment Categories

Users can add new repayment categories or "groups" beyond the default annual and monthly options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   To add a new group, click the "add a group" button and specify the installment period, such as "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Clicking "save" will automatically insert the new [[repayment_schedule_management | repayment schedule management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The system comes with pre-added schedules, including quarterly and weekly repayments, which can be viewed by clicking "three hidden groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules by dragging and dropping them into the desired category (e.g., moving a debt under "quarterly" will update its [[repayment_schedule_management | repayment schedule]] accordingly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Managing Debt Entries

The system allows for easy addition and modification of loan details:
*   **Adding New Debt**: To quickly add a new debt, click the "added details" button. This will add it to a "no payment frequency" column, from which it can be moved to an appropriate frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Loan Details**: To edit existing loan details, simply click on the debt field and type in the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Updates automatically apply across all related columns and descriptions in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments (Transaction Section)

The transaction section allows users to record and monitor their debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It displays a "paid installment section" that reflects all payments made, bifurcated by month, with a summation of EMIs paid for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Key features in the transaction section:
*   **Payment Status**: A column indicates if an amount has been paid or not. Ticking or unticking this box automatically updates the debt's status in either the "paid installment" or "unpaid" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Payment Date**: Users can input the specific date of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan Details Selection**: Users can select the specific loan for which the payment is being recorded from a list of previously added loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment**: The amount of the installment paid can be entered here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule**: The system automatically calculates and displays the next repayment schedule based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a monthly student loan payment made on September 30th will show October 30th as the next payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Similarly, an annual [[mortgage_payment_tracking | home loan]] payment made on September 27, 2023, will show September 27, 2024, as the next due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Adding New Debt Payments**: Clicking the "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Users can then fill in details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Automatic Progress Updates

The [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | debt payoff progress]] section provides a summary that updates automatically as payments are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This summary includes:
*   **Total Repaid Amount**: The sum of all EMIs paid for specific loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: The percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By Date**: A quick reference to the projected debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount Paid**: The total interest paid as part of the repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount Repaid**: The portion of the repayment that went towards the principal amount of the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Every payment made is split into interest and principal components, which are reported at the bottom of the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Changes made to payment amounts instantly reflect in the [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | debt payoff progress]] summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This comprehensive [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracking]] tool ensures all debt details are kept current.

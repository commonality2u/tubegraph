This guide outlines how to set and track sales targets using a dedicated sales performance system, typically integrated within a platform like Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The system provides a [[sales_performance_tracking_using_notion | sales performance OS]] that allows for detailed oversight of sales data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Sales Performance Dashboard Overview

The core of the system is the [[components_of_a_sales_dashboard | sales dashboard]], which offers three primary components for tracking sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

1.  **Salesperson Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
    *   Tracks sales made by individual salespeople per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Displays achieved sales, [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals | targeted sales]], percentage of target achieved, and target achievement status (e.g., "Target achieved" if sales exceed target, "Target not achieved" otherwise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

2.  **Sales Channel Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   Represents sales made from various sources (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Allows for custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   Similar to salesperson tracking, it shows achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

3.  **Sales Location Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   Shows sales made to different geographical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Tracks sales using the same characteristics as salesperson and channel performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

All three components are divided by month, offering a comprehensive view of sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Sales Overviews

Beyond monthly breakdowns, the system provides broader overviews:

*   **Salesperson Overview**: Displays total sales made by each individual, sale units sold, and average sales per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview**: Shows total sales, sale units, and average sales for each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview**: Provides total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These overviews help to [[tracking_business_activities | track]] and summarize business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Entering Sales Transactions

The sales dashboard is dynamically updated by [[setting_up_a_sales_receipts_database | sales transactions]] entered into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Sales Transaction Details

When entering a transaction, you provide the following information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:

*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Account Details**: Information about the salesperson involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Sales Detail**: What was sold and any additional information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Month and Year**: For categorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Detail**: Specific salesperson responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Client Detail**: To whom the sale was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Client information (address, city, state) can be entered via a dedicated dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Code**: A unique code specific to each salesperson, month, and year (e.g., `jcore_december23` for James Carter in December 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Sales Amount**: The monetary value of the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Sales Unit**: The number of units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Setting Sales Targets

Before entering daily transactions, [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals | sales targets]] can be set for the start of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Individual Salesperson Targets**: Assign a specific sales target for each person responsible for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Targets**: Set targeted sales goals for each sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Targets**: Specify targeted sales amounts for each individual location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

> [!tip] Quick Action Button
> A "Sales Target" quick action button on the left panel allows you to automatically assign targets for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

As sales are made, the [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | sales amount]] is entered, and the system automatically updates the percentage of target achieved and the status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Customization and Filtering

The [[sales_performance_tracking_using_notion | sales dashboard]] is fully customizable to your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>:

*   **Currency**: You can change the currency displayed throughout the dashboard to your preferred choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This can be done by clicking on an amount, selecting "edit property," and changing the number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: Individual salesperson details, channel names, and location names can be edited or new ones added directly from the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. You can also set cover images for individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Creating New Months/Years**: The system allows for the creation of new months and years for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Filtering Data**: Use filters to view sales data for specific periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>:
    *   **Filter by Year**: Add a filter for "year" to display data for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **Filter by Month**: Add a filter for "month" to see data for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   **Combined Filters**: Use a combination of month and year filters to refine your view, for example, all months within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

These features allow for a detailed and flexible approach to [[tracking_completion_status_in_business_plans | tracking sales performance]] and ensuring targets are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

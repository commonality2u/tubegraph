Sanat Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to set up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp using [[finance_templates_in_notion | Notion templates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system allows you to receive automatic notifications for upcoming bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder in Notion:
1.  Click on the main drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Recurring Payments and Notifications

After creating the bill template, you can set it to repeat on a recurring basis:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat, for instance, "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time you wish to receive the notification, such as 11:55 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Set the specific day of the month for the notification, for example, the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
6.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   This will automatically send notifications to your WhatsApp at the specified time and day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

To enable these WhatsApp notifications, the system requires integration with an automation tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for setting up this automation are included when you download the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once the automation is configured and the template is set to recur, you will receive notifications automatically each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Notifications typically arrive within a minute of the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

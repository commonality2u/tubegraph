[[managing_and_exporting_pdfs_with_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] offers a solution for businesses to create and [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_process | generate PDF documents]] in bulk, streamlining the [[workflow_for_exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | document export process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01">[03:09:01]</a>. This platform allows users to manage and export multiple PDF documents efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:40">[04:40:40]</a>.

## Accessing Bulk Export Mode

To begin [[exporting_bulk_purchase_order_documents | exporting bulk purchase order documents]], or any other PDF documents, users can switch from the single PDF mode to the "bulk export mode" by simply clicking the designated option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:40">[04:40:40]</a>.

## Filling the Database

In the bulk export mode, a database is provided where users can fill in details for multiple PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:27">[04:46:27]</a>. The fields available in this database are identical to those found in the single PDF mode, such as invoice number and invoice date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:09">[05:23:09]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:46">[05:28:46]</a>. This allows for [[generating_bulk_pdfs_with_database_integration | generating bulk PDFs with database integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>.

## Generating Bulk PDFs

Once the database is populated with the necessary information, users can initiate the [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_process | bulk PDF generation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:09">[05:38:09]</a>. By clicking "Download all PDF," the system will generate individual PDF documents one by one, based on the entered data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:09">[05:45:09]</a>. These documents will maintain the same format as those generated in the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:04">[05:57:04]</a>. The currency selected will also be reflected in the generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:44">[06:01:44]</a>.

## Individual Row Export

Within the bulk export mode database, there is also an option to export a PDF document for a specific row individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:42">[06:22:42]</a>. This allows for flexibility in generating single documents even when operating in bulk mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:06">[06:24:06]</a>.

## Future Developments

[[pdfoutput_for_bulk_document_generation | PDFOutput]] currently supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:14">[06:08:14]</a>. Future updates are planned to include integration with Notion databases, enabling users to add details in Notion and export documents directly from [[using_pdf_output_for_document_export and preview | PDFOutput]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:04">[06:10:04]</a>. Users can also request new templates or provide feedback through designated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.

The Notion Books Freelancers OS is a comprehensive dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their income, expenses, and client interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This setup is available for download and provides a centralized system for tracking various aspects of a freelancing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard features two main navigation windows:
*   **[[managing_finances_for_freelancers_using_notion | Finance Section]]**: Dedicated to tracking all financial details, including income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **[[client_management_strategies_in_notion_for_freelancers | Client Section]]**: A portal for all aspects of [[client_management_strategies_in_notion_for_freelancers | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Quick instructions are available on the dashboard to guide users on how to change currency and utilize the [[setting_up_a_finance_tracker_in_notion | finance setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Finance Section Details

The [[managing_finances_for_freelancers_using_notion | Finance section]] allows freelancers to book income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Adding Client Income**: Income related to a client can be added and classified as "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Users can also create their own income classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. For example, to add new client income, select "New Income," enter the income name (e.g., "Client Income"), and classify it as "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Workflow Integration**: All income transactions classified under "client" in the Finance section will automatically reflect in the Client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

For a comprehensive tutorial on using the [[how_to_set_up_and_use_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | finance setup]], a linked video demonstration is available on the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Client Section Details

The Client section provides a detailed system for [[client_management_strategies_in_notion_for_freelancers | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is navigable from the Finance section by clicking "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Upon entering the Client section, users will find several key areas:
*   Invoicing Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

#### Client Details

The Client Details section helps track clients through different stages:

    *   **Hourly Basis**: By specifying estimated hours and actual hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **Invoicing Basis**: By comparing the total project value to the total value of invoices assigned to that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

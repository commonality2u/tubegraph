This article explains how to utilize a monthly budget planner in [[Using Notion as an expense tracker | Notion]] for [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting and tracking expenses]] on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system allows users to categorize expenses, set budgets, and monitor their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Overview of the Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four main views to help users understand their financial situation:

*   **Expenses Overview** This view provides a summary of various expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the budget incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or remains under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** This section presents all expenses in a monthly format, allowing users to see categorized expenses for each month at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Similar to the monthly view, this provides the same expense information but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary** This view offers a complete overview of expenses in a yearly format, combining all expenses to provide insight into overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This section can help with [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budget and actual expense tracking in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Entering Expense Details

To use this budget planner, all financial information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The expenses within this database are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the most recent months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Booking an Expense Transaction

To add a new expense:
1.  Click on the "new" button within the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
3.  Provide a description for the expense (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant period (month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Choose the appropriate category for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Pre-defined categories include shopping, entertainment, food expenses, and utilities, but users can add their own to allow for [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customizing expense categories and budgeting in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This flexibility contributes to the [[benefits of tracking expenses in Notion | benefits of tracking expenses in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
6.  Assign an expense code, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
7.  Enter the amount of the expense in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Setting a Budget

At the beginning of each month, users can set a budget for specific expenses:
1.  Select the start date of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the name of the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Choose the expense category (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For budget entries, the expense name and category name should generally be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  Input the budget amount into the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once an expense or budget is entered, all figures in the overview sections are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

After [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses in Notion]] through the expense details database, users can further analyze their finances:

*   **Period and Year Analysis** Clicking on a specific period (month) or year will open a new window that displays all transactions booked for that timeframe, including the amounts and whether each entry was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Category Analysis** Users can view how much expense has been booked for a particular category, showing the expense amount, budgeted amount, expense as a percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all transactions related to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for [[setting_and_managing_business_expense_categories_in_notion | setting and managing business expense categories in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Expense Code Analysis** The expense code allows users to track how much has been booked for a specific category within a particular month, comparing it against the allocated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, the Notion template provides real-time updates across all four views, allowing users to monitor their financial progress throughout the month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The template can be customized to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

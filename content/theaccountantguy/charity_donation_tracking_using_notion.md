Anat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," introduces a charity donation tracker designed in Notion to help users track their donations towards charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Tracker Overview

The charity donation tracker is organized into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
*   Fund Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Donations Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These sections are complemented by a "Recent Donations" area and a "Quarterly Overview" for detailed tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section is where you define and manage the charities or funds you wish to donate to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Funds
Under each category, specific funds or organizations are listed (e.g., American Red Cross, WHO, Care funds under Health; Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy under Environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Currency Settings

The entire dashboard can be set up in any preferred currency, as Notion supports many different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. A separate video is available to guide users on changing the currency settings within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This specific mention of changing currency implies a broader utility of [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | Notion for financial tracking]], such as [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | tracking income and expenses]], [[how_to_track_income_and_expenses_using_notion | tracking income and expenses]], [[expense_tracking_using_notion | expense tracking]], or [[tracking_restaurant_expenses_with_notion | tracking restaurant expenses]]. More advanced uses might include [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | investment tracking]] or [[using_notion_for_tax_payment_tracking | tax payment tracking]], as part of a general [[summary_and_overview_of_donations_in_notion | summary of donations in Notion]] or a broader [[tracking_savings_goals_in_notion | tracking savings goals]] using Notion's flexible database features.

The summary section of the tracker provides a clear overview of financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It displays the:
*   Budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

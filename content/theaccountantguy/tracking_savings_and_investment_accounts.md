Notion offers a comprehensive setup for tracking personal finances, including dedicated sections for savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This system allows users to specify financial targets and manage various accounts, providing a clear overview of financial positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## [[tracking_sinking_funds_for_personal_saving_goals | Tracking Savings Goals]]

The personal finance tracker includes a "savings" section where users can input all savings related to their finances and monitor their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Setting up Savings Accounts

To begin [[tracking_sinking_funds_for_personal_saving_goals | tracking savings goals]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view and access the "Asset" part, as savings are considered assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Users can create new savings accounts, such as an "education fund" or a "car fund," and classify them under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
When setting up a new savings account, users can:
*   Input the account name (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   Leave the opening balance empty if starting new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   Classify the account under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   Specify a goal amount for the fund (e.g., $1200 for a car fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This will enable the display of the total amount saved and the percentage achieved towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

### [[adding_and_tracking_savings_transactions | Adding Savings Transactions]]

To record transactions related to savings, go to the "Asset" section under the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
When adding a new savings transaction:
*   Select the transaction date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
*   Add a description (e.g., "Car Fund Savings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   Choose the specific savings account (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
*   Select the payment mode (e.g., "Bank" if transferring from a bank account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   Set the transaction type as "Outflow," as money is moving out of the main account into the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   Enter the amount saved (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

These transactions will update the total saved amount and the percentage achieved towards the goal in the savings section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Icons can also be added to savings accounts for visual identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### Viewing Savings Progress

The "Savings" section under the "Summary" view provides an updated overview of how much has been saved and the remaining goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. It shows the total amount saved and the percentage indicating progress towards the set goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

## [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | Tracking Investment Accounts]]

The tracker includes an "Investment" tab to monitor investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. This tab displays the total investment amount, number of units, profit or loss, and investment percentage for each asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

### Setting up Investment Accounts

To set up investment accounts, go to the "Accounts" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   Investments are considered "assets," so specify an opening balance if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   Classify the investment (e.g., "Stocks," "Crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Users can create custom classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   Enter "Opening Units" to reflect the number of units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   Crucially, select "Investments" as the asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. This classification is vital for calculating the total investment value in the "Investment" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

### Adding Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded under the "Asset" section within the "Transactions" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
When recording investment transactions, specific rules apply:
*   **Purchases:** Any investment purchased should be recorded at its **cost price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   Example: 50 units of Apple stock purchased at $10 per unit, recorded as $500 (cost value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Sales:** When selling an investment, record the **cost value** of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
    *   Example: If 30 units (originally costing $10 each) are sold for $40 each, the amount recorded in the transaction should be $300 (the original cost of 30 units), not $1200 (the sale value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

### Calculating Profit/Loss

By recording sales at cost value, the system can automatically calculate the profit or loss on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. For instance, selling 30 units with a cost of $300 for a total of $1200 (sale value) will show a profit of $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. This functionality provides clarity on the actual gains or losses from investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. The "Investment" tab then displays the overall profit or loss from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.

## General Information

This personal finance tracker is designed for individuals and can also be adapted for couples by splitting accounts by individual (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

### Device and Cost

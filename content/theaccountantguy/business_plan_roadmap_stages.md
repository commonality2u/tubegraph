The business plan roadmap is a view within a [[utilizing_business_plan_templates | business plan template]] designed to organize the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This roadmap provides a structured approach to planning, moving from initial ideas to long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The template typically offers two main views:
1.  The Business Plan Roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
2.  The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

## Structure of the Roadmap

The business plan roadmap divides the planning process into various stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template presented includes 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, such as:
*   Conceptual Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Users have the flexibility to edit these stages by clicking on a pencil icon, allowing for customization of the roadmap to suit specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Key Components of Each Stage

Each stage within the business plan roadmap contains several critical elements to ensure comprehensive planning and tracking:

### Defining Objectives
For each stage, specific objectives can be set to clearly define what needs to be achieved during that phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, the "Planning and Structuring" stage might have an objective to "blueprint business plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### [[task_management_in_business_planning | Task Management]]
Within each stage, various [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] are associated to help break down the work required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, "Conceptual Research" might involve two distinct [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Each [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] includes:
*   **Deadline:** A specified date for when the [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] should be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox:** A checkbox to mark a [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Status:** An assignable status to indicate the current progress or state of the [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

New [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] can be added within any stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Completion Tracking
A key feature of the roadmap is its automatic completion percentage tracking. When a [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] within a stage is marked as complete, the overall completion percentage for that stage updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] and one is completed, the stage will show 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Completing all [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] will bring the stage to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This percentage is visible at the top of the stage view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Documentation
Each stage also includes a documentation section where objectives and [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]] can be specified in detail, providing further context and information for each planning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Integrating with the [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]]
The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] view complements the roadmap by displaying all planned activities, deadlines, and statuses in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This offers a quick overview of the entire plan, showing the timeline for each stage, its associated [[task_management_in_business_planning | tasks]], and their current statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Clicking on an arrow in the timeline will navigate to the specific date and show details for all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

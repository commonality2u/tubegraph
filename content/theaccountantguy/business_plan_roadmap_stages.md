The business plan template is designed to help in [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion|planning for your business]] by organizing the entire process into distinct stages through a "business plan roadmap" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Overview of the Business Plan Roadmap

The business plan roadmap divides the entire [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion|business planning]] process into different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template typically includes 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Key Components:
*   **Stage Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   **Objectives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   **Completion Percentage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

### Examples of Stages:
Stages in the roadmap can range from initial steps to advanced phases of business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Examples include:
*   Conceptional Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

### Editing and Defining Stages
You can edit the business plan roadmap to customize different stages as needed by clicking on a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For each stage, you can:
*   Set specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Specify which business plan corresponds to a particular stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Managing Tasks within Stages

Each stage in the business plan roadmap has associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, "Conception and Research" might have two distinct tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Task Details:
*   **Deadline:** A specific date by which the task should be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Completion Status:** A checkbox to indicate if a task is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status:** Allows assigning a status (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed") as per requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Adding and Documenting Tasks:
*   New tasks can be added to a specific stage by clicking a "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Detailed objectives and tasks can be documented at the bottom of each stage view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Tracking Progress

The template automatically tracks the completion percentage for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   When a task's completion checkbox is marked, the overall completion percentage for that stage updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   For instance, if a stage has two tasks, completing one task will show 50% completion for that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Completing both tasks will show 100% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Events Timeline

In addition to the roadmap, the template also provides an [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning|events timeline]] view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This view presents all planned stages, tasks, and deadlines in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The timeline displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The timeline set for specific stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Stage name and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Date and status of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

This provides a quick overview of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Clicking on timeline arrows allows you to navigate to specific dates and view details of stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

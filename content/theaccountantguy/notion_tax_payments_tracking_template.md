This Notion template helps users track all their tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It includes a [[tracking_quarterly_tax_payments_using_notion | quarterly tax payment]] section for tracking tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is divided into summary sections at the top and a transaction section at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Tax Payment Summary

The top of the template features a tax payment summary that displays key financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

#### Accounts

This section is for setting up all revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** Where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** Where input tax credit can be availed to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Users can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons, which automatically create new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The summary indicates the number of active revenue and expense sources, updating automatically as new ones are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

#### Financials

This section tracks the total revenue amount, expense amount, tax liability, and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Figures here update automatically once transaction details are fed into the transactions view at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

#### Quarterly Taxes

This part reflects all tax payments that need to be made for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes Payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Input Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax Liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

#### Profit/Loss Section

This section provides a summary of the total revenue earned from all transactions, expenses booked so far, and the total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Transaction Section

After setting up revenue and expense sources, users can scroll down to the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

#### Adding Revenue Transactions

Clicking "Add Revenue" automatically adds a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Users then select the period (e.g., Quarter 3), the relevant revenue account (e.g., Goods), input the amount, and specify a tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The template then automatically calculates the tax payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

#### Adding Expense Transactions

Similarly, clicking "Add Expense" adds a new expense entry for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Users fill in details like the period, the expense account (e.g., Purchases), the amount, and the tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The input credit is then calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

All data entered in the transaction section updates the summary sections automatically, including the quarterly taxes and profit/loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This article explores how [[tracking_expenses_with_Notion | Notion can be utilized for tracking expenses]], specifically demonstrating a film production budget tracker template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This template helps manage all expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Template Overview

The film production budget tracker template in Notion includes a table that lists all expenses individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Each expense is associated with a specific category and its corresponding amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Expense Categories

The template displays the category for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Users can define their own categories by clicking a pencil icon, and these updates will be reflected across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses

The template allows for updating budgeted expense values directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Once these values are entered, all related figures update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Expense amounts can also be entered on the expense side, which similarly updates the overall figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Summary Section

A dedicated summary section provides a comprehensive overview of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This section includes:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This summary offers a concise view of total expenses and how they compare to the current budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Managing Categories

Users have full control over managing categories within the template:
*   **Adding new categories**: Click on "new page" to add a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Editing categories**: Use the pencil icon to edit an existing category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Deleting categories**: Click on the three-dot icon and select "delete" to remove a category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

These options ensure complete flexibility in managing expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

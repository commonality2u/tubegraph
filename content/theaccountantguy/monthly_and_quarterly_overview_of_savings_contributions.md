The "Emergency Funds" template provides a structured way to track savings, offering [[monthly_view_and_performance_tracking | monthly]] and [[quarterly_financial_summaries | quarterly]] overviews of contributions to ensure users meet their financial goals.

## Contributions Section
The contributions section is organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top. It also indicates the number of contributions made for each specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Each contribution entry includes:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Period**: Predefined months for the current year (e.g., 2023) can be selected, or new months for other years (e.g., March 2024) can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Users can select the specific emergency fund (e.g., Car Repair Fund, Job Loss Fund) to which the contribution is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The amount of savings or contribution being made for the specific month towards a specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: This column displays the required monthly contribution for a specific fund to meet its targeted goal amount by the set end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   A tick mark or check mark appears if the contribution made for the month equals or exceeds the required amount, indicating the target has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A "quick action" button automatically adds a new line item for the current month and date, simplifying data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview
The [[quarterly_financial_summaries | quarterly overview]] provides a single-glance view of contributions across all months within each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Quarters are organized as: Quarter 1 (January, February, March), Quarter 2 (April, May, June), Quarter 3 (July, August, September), and Quarter 4 (October, November, December) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   For each month, it displays the total savings made and the required amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   It also shows the "savings requirement percentage," indicating how much of the monthly target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Different colors are used to provide a quick visual snapshot of financial performance related to emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   The total savings for each quarter are summed up and displayed at the top of the quarterly view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Savings Overview
The contributions made through the [[tracking_contributions_and_progress_of_emergency_savings | contribution entries]] feed into the overall "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This section categorizes savings by:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

For each emergency fund, the overview displays:
*   **Total Savings**: The cumulative amount saved, including the starting balance and all contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings**: The goal amount set for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved**: How much of the total savings requirement has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date**: The end goal date for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left**: The remaining time until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month**: The monthly contribution needed to meet the fund's target by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This value updates as time passes, guiding continued contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

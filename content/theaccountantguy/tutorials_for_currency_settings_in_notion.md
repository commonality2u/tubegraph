The creator of the Notion subscription expense tracker, Sanat Biswal (also known as "the accountant guy"), has included a tutorial within the tracker itself on how to customize currency settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Adjusting Dashboard Currency

A quick tutorial explaining how to change the currency displayed in the dashboard is provided underneath the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:51">[03:50:51]</a>. This allows users to set the dashboard to [[using_notion_savings_funds_tracker_with_different_currencies | different currencies]] as per their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

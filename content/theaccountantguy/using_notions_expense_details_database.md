The "expense details database" is a core component of a Notion-based monthly budget planner, serving as the primary location for entering and tracking all financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality

This database is designed to:
*   Help calculate and track day-to-day expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20">[01:20]</a>.
*   Categorize expenses by month, with months sorted in a descending format (later months appearing on top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[01:32]</a>.
*   Facilitate both the recording of actual expenses and the setting of monthly budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To add a new transaction:
1.  Click the "new" button within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Enter the transaction date; it automatically updates the associated month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>.
3.  **Expense Detail**: Input the specific expense, e.g., "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>.
4.  **Period**: Select the relevant month and year (e.g., "Feb 2024"). New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13">[02:13]</a>.
5.  **Year**: Select the corresponding year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25">[02:25]</a>.
6.  **Category**: Choose the type of expense. Pre-defined categories include "Shopping," "Entertainment," "Food expenses," and "Utilities," but custom categories can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30">[02:30]</a>.
7.  **Expense Code**: This code segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>.
8.  **Expense Amount**: Enter the actual amount incurred for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.

### Expense Amount vs. Budget Amount
The database contains two distinct columns for financial figures:
*   **Expense Amount**: Used for booking actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: Used at the beginning of the month to set a budget for a specific expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

## Setting a Budget

To set a budget for a specific expense category at the start of a month:
1.  Select the desired date, typically the first of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name, which should match the category for budget entries (e.g., "Food expense" for the "Food" category) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>.
3.  Select the corresponding period and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.
4.  Choose the relevant category (e.g., "Food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.
5.  Set the expense code to reflect the category and month (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>.
6.  Enter the allocated budget amount in the "budget column" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>.

Entering information into the [[using_notion_for_expense_tracking|expense details database]] automatically updates all associated figures in the overview sections of the budget planner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.

## Gaining Insights from the Database

The [[using_databases_in_notion_for_expense_tracking|expense details database]] can be used to analyze financial performance in various ways:

### Period Overview
Clicking on a "period" (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing:
*   All transactions booked for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.
*   Details of the amount, indicating whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>.
This provides a quick overview of monthly finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Clicking on a "year" provides a similar view for the entire year, displaying:
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>.
*   Expenses amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>.
*   Expenses as a percentage of the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.
*   Budget status (e.g., under or over budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>.
*   All transactions for the year, including their amounts and whether they were expenses or budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50">[05:50]</a>.

### Category Overview
Examining a "category" reveals:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>.
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.
*   Expenses as a percentage of the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10">[06:10]</a>.

*   All related expenses booked within that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>.

### Expense Code Overview
The "expense code" offers insight into the amount booked for a particular category within a specific month, compared to its total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, the Notion planner provides an automatically updated and comprehensive view of financial progress throughout the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>. This system allows for [[using_notion_for_expense_management|tracking expenses with Notion]] and maintaining an overview of financial health through its four distinct views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[06:47]</a>.

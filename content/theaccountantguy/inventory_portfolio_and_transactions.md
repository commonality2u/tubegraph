This article details a template designed to [[tracking_inventory_for_small_businesses | track inventory for small businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, focusing on its inventory portfolio management and transaction tracking capabilities.

## Inventory Portfolio

The template includes an inventory portfolio section with three distinct views:
*   Inventory Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Inventory Portfolio (display view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

### Inventory Setup and Classification

The [[inventory_setup_and_classification | inventory setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> view allows for the classification of inventory into three categories:
*   Raw Materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Work in Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Finished Goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

For each inventory item added, the following details can be specified:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units:** The initial quantity of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Principle:** Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WAC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users unfamiliar with these terms can leave this as default without affecting reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level:** The unit quantity at which a reorder of the inventory item is triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, a reorder level of 60 units for wheat and 10 units for corn was set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

New inventory items can be added by clicking the "add inventor" button, which places them in a "no classification" window, from where they can be moved to a specific category (e.g., Work in Progress) and their values entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Inventory Portfolio (View)

This view provides an overview of the inventory status after all transactions have been processed:
*   **Inventory Value:** The total value of inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available:** The quantity of units remaining after all purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level:** This feature alerts users when stock levels fall below the set reorder level. For instance, if wheat drops below 60 units, a "low stock" message appears, prompting a reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Conversely, if an item like corn has 70 units available against a reorder level of 10, it indicates a "surplus" and no immediate reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Inventory Status

This section tracks the current location or stage of inventory items:
*   **Status Categories:** Predefined statuses include "in transit," "in progress," and "not sent," which can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** It shows the count of items in each status. For example, a purchase of 50 units of corn might be "in transit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, while a sales item might be "not sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Items can be easily moved between statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[managing_inventory_transactions | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> of the template manages inventory purchases, sales, and tracks associated profit and loss.

### Purchases

Purchase transactions are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Key fields for a purchase entry include:
*   **Date:** Automatically populates with the current date, but can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Description:** A field for additional notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Account:** Allows selection of the specific inventory item (e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Number of Units:** The quantity purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Purchase Price:** The cost per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Total Amount:** Automatically calculated based on units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status:** Assigns a status (e.g., "in transit," "received") to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

A "buy inventory" quick action button allows for rapid addition of new purchase entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Sales

The sales section functions similarly to the purchases section, allowing users to record inventory sales and related details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit & Loss

This section helps calculate the profitability of sales:
*   Users input the sales price and the corresponding purchase price or manufacturing cost of the item sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   The template automatically calculates the profit or loss. For example, selling bread for $40 that cost $10 to produce results in a $30 profit per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If 30 units were sold, the total profit would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

This comprehensive approach allows businesses to efficiently track their inventory, manage transactions, and monitor profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This article details how to utilize a Notion template to track inventory for small businesses, focusing on inventory status and reorder levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Inventory Status

The "inventory status" view shows the current state of an inventory item, such as whether it is in transit or has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:15">[03:14:15]</a>.

Common statuses include:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>

Users can edit existing statuses or add new ones as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. For example, a purchase of 50 units of corn for $500, made on August 26th, might currently be in "in transit" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This status can be changed by moving it to a different category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Similarly, a sales transaction might be under "not sent" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This feature allows for quick tracking of inventory location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

The inventory status is also assigned to individual transactions within the [[tracking_inventory_transactions | transactions]] section, allowing users to track the status of specific purchases or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Reorder Levels

A "reorder level" indicates the threshold of units at which new inventory should be ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This level is set in the "Inventory Setup" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Examples:
*   Wheat: A reorder level of 60 units is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. If the available units drop below 60, a "low stock" message appears, indicating the need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. For instance, if 30 units of wheat are available after all transactions, reordering is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   Corn: A reorder level of 10 units is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. If 70 units of corn are available, it indicates a surplus, and no reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

This feature provides a quick overview of inventory levels across different categories, helping to determine if sufficient units are available or if reordering is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

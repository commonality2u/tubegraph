3.  Specify the bill amount, for example, fifteen hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

5.  Select the desired frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
6.  Set the specific time and day for the notification to be received, for instance, 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

The system relies on an automation platform, specifically [[Automating email reminders with Gmail via P Connect | Pabbly Connect]], to manage and send these reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Once the automation workflow is established in Pabbly Connect, notifications are sent automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. When a template is set on a [[Automation of recurring payment notifications | recurring basis]], such as every month, the user will automatically receive notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The system typically sends the notification within a minute of the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

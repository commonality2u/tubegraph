This article explains how to [[managing_debt_payments_and_statuses | track debt payments]] and manage budgets using a Notion-based personal finance tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The system is divided into key sections: Net Worth Target, Account Section (for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities), and a Summary Section for an at-a-glance financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments

The tracker provides a dedicated section for [[debt_payment_tracking_and_analysis | debt payment tracking and analysis]], showing upcoming and past payments, along with total debt and amounts paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Setting Up Debt Accounts
To begin [[debt_and_liability_tracking | tracking debt and liability tracking]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. All debts are categorized as liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Adding New Debt**: Click the "new" button, enter the debt name, and specify an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Classify the account as "debt" from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debt**: To modify an existing debt, click the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Entering Debt Payment Transactions
Once debt accounts are set up, enter transactions under the "Liability" section within the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Click "new," select the date, choose the debt account (e.g., home loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Select the payment mode (e.g., bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   For repayments, the transaction type is "outflow" as money is leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   For obtaining a new loan, the transaction type would be "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   Input the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This updates the total loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Tracking Progress of Debt Payoff
The "Debt" view under the "Summary" section allows for [[tracking_progress_of_debt_payoff | tracking progress of debt payoff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows debts due in the future, with their next payment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Lists payments made in the past, and can highlight missed payments if the last payment date is before the expected frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Debt Details**: Each debt card shows the total loan amount (opening balance + additional loans), the total repayment in percentage, and the amount remaining unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Customizing the View**: Change the layout (e.g., list, gallery, board) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, enable desired properties, and sort by payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

## Tracking Budgets

The budget section enables users to set up budgets for estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Setting Up Income and Expense Accounts
Before budgeting, set up income and expense accounts in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   Add or modify accounts like "Salary," "Side Hustle," "Groceries," "Utility Bills," and "Netflix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Expenses can be classified (e.g., "Bills," "Subscriptions") and assigned a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Income and expenses typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Entering Income and Expense Transactions
All transactions affecting income and expenses are entered in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Income**: Navigate to the "Income" section, click "new," select the date, enter a description, choose the income account (e.g., "Salary"), specify the payment mode (e.g., "Bank"), and set the transaction type as "Inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Follow the same process under the "Expense" section, but select "Outflow" as the transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Managing Budgets
The "Budget" view under the "Summary" section allows for [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget management and updates]] and [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | tracking expenses against budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   It displays total incurred expenses and income, and their percentage against the set budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   Budget amounts can be adjusted by clicking on the budget field for any expense or income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   If the budget amount is not visible, it might be hidden in the properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Click on the item, then access "31 more properties" and search for "budgeted amount" to enable its display and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## General Features & Tips

### Template Accessibility and Cost
The Notion template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. Notion is a free tool, requiring only an email ID to sign up, so there are no extra charges to use the template beyond its purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

### Currency Support
Notion supports multiple currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. To change the currency:
1.  Locate any field with a currency sign (e.g., dollar sign).
2.  Click on the field, then select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
3.  Go to "Number format" and choose your desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This will update all instances of that currency format across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

### For Couples
For couples, the dashboard is fully applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Account categories can be split by individual (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") to track finances separately within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

### Viewing Specific Account Transactions
To quickly view all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., "Salary" or a specific utility bill), navigate to the "Finances" section in the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. Click on the desired income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. A "View transactions" option will appear at the bottom of the right-side window, which when clicked, will automatically populate all transactions associated only with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

This Notion template is designed to help users track all their tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive view of tax liabilities and helps manage financial details across different sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Sections of the Template

The template organizes information into several interconnected sections:

### Tax Payment Summary

Located at the top, this summary displays three key areas: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts

This section is for setting up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are sources where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include services and goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These are sources where input tax credit can be availed to set off against tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons: "Add Revenue Source" automatically adds a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and "Add Expense Source" adds an expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Details can be entered using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The summary automatically updates to reflect the number of revenue and expense sources added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Financials

The Financials section allows you to track total revenue and expense amounts, along with corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, it shows total revenues earned from services and the total tax payable on those services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. All data in this section automatically updates once details are fed into the transactions view at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This section reflects all tax payments that need to be made for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it displays taxes payable, input tax, and the final tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Figures update based on transactions booked for specific quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Transactions

This is the detailed section where individual revenue and expense transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

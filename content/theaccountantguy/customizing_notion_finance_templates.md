[[notion_finance_templates | Notion Finance Templates]] offer a structured way to manage personal finances. The monthly budget planner, for example, is designed to help users budget for each month and track expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This guide demonstrates how to utilize and customize such templates for effective [[using_notion_templates_for_financial_management | financial management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Planner Template

The monthly budget planner features four distinct views for comprehensive financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview**: This view provides a summary of pre-defined expense categories such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is still under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview**: This section organizes all tracked expenses into a monthly format, allowing users to see all expenditures for a specific month at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview**: Similar to the monthly overview, this view presents expense information in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: This view offers a complete financial overlook for the year, consolidating all expenses to provide insight into overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

All data for these views is drawn from the "expense details database," where all transaction information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Entering Transactions and Setting Budgets in Notion

The template is designed for easy data entry and budget setting:

### Entering Transactions

To begin, users enter transactions into the "expense details" database. Expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

1.  **Add New Transaction**: Click "new" to add a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Date Entry**: Input the transaction date, e.g., February 1, 2024. The template automatically adjusts based on the month entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  **Expense Detail**: Enter the specific expense, such as "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  **Period Selection**: Select the relevant period (e.g., "Feb 2024"). New periods can also be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
5.  **Year Selection**: Select the corresponding year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  **Category Selection**: Choose an expense category (e.g., "utilities"). Users can also [[customizing_the_notion_expense_tracker_template | customize the Notion expense tracker template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> by adding their own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
7.  **Expense Code**: Input an expense code to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  **Expense Amount**: Enter the actual expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Setting a Budget for Specific Expenses

[[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | Customizing budget templates in Notion]] involves setting budgets at the beginning of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

1.  **Date Entry**: Select the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Expense Name**: Enter the name of the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Period and Year**: Select the period (e.g., "February") and year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Category Selection**: Select the relevant category (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   *Note*: For budgeting, the expense name and category name typically remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  **Expense Code**: Input the expense code (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  **Budget Amount**: Enter the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once budgeted and actual expenses are entered, the template automatically updates all figures in the overview sections, providing real-time financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This allows users to monitor their financial progress throughout the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

The template's various views allow for in-depth analysis of financial data:

*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a detailed view of all transactions for that period, showing both budgeted and actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Similarly, selecting a year displays the budgeted amounts, actual expenses, expense percentages, and budget status for the entire year, along with all associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View**: This view shows how much has been spent for a particular category versus its budget, including percentage and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all category-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: Users can check the amount booked for a specific category and month against its total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These analytical tools help users understand their financial situation by tracking every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The template is further [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> to suit individual [[using_notion_templates_for_personal_finance_management | personal finance management]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This guide provides a walkthrough of a Notion-based [[business_budget_template_setup_in_notion | business expense tracker]] designed to help businesses manage and budget their expenses efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It consolidates all business expenses in one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Setting up Expense Categories

The first step in [[using_notion_for_expense_management | managing business expenses using Notion]] is to define expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Predefined Heads** The tracker comes with some predefined heads of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Modifying Categories** To modify or change an existing category, click on it and then click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories** Subcategories can be edited by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories** Users can add new categories by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts** For each category, a budgeted amount can be set, which will be automatically reflected in the overall tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For example, if the budgeted amount for "advertising" is changed from $100 to $5,000, all related overviews will update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It displays:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   A percentage indicating whether actual expenses have exceeded or stayed within the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Recording Transactions

The "transaction side" allows for detailed entry of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Entering Details** To enter an expense, click to choose the date, which will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Description and Account** Add a description of the expense and select an account from predefined options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Amount** Finally, input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary and Customization

*   Budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

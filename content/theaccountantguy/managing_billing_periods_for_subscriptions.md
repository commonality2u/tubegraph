The subscription expenses tracker allows users to efficiently track all their subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is designed to manage various aspects of subscriptions, including their billing periods.

## Overview and Customization

The tracker features a "subscription overview" section, which provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Under the [[bills_distribution_categories_and_periods | categories view]], subscriptions are divided into "active" and "cancel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For each subscription listed, users can see:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   The [[bills_distribution_categories_and_periods | billing period]] for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

To change the [[bills_distribution_categories_and_periods | billing period]], users can click on the existing period to reveal all available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While it is possible to change the name of the billing period, it is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Users can select any billing period that suits their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Transaction Details and Automation

The "transaction section" is where detailed information for subscription expenses is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This section includes views for [[viewing_and_canceling_subscriptions_in_notion | active subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and [[viewing_and_canceling_subscriptions_in_notion | canceled subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, bifurcated by month with total expenses for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

When logging a new transaction:
*   Users can select the specific subscription account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   The [[bills_distribution_categories_and_periods | billing period]] is automatically pulled from the value set in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   A payment date can be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Upon entering the subscription amount, the renewal date is automatically calculated based on the selected [[bills_distribution_categories_and_periods | billing period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30th with a monthly billing period will automatically show an October 30th renewal date, calculating exactly one month from the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This automated calculation also applies to annual and weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The tracker also allows for changing the display currency within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

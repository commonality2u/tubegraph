The subscription expenses tracker provides functionality to manage and track the billing periods for all your subscriptions, which is crucial for [[subscription_expenses_tracking_in_Notion | managing subscription expenses]].

## Billing Period Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

In the subscription overview section, alongside the name of the subscription and total expenses incurred, you will find the billing period for each subscription displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This provides a quick glance at how frequently each service is billed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Changing and Selecting Billing Periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

The tracker allows for easy modification of billing periods:
*   **Modifying Existing Periods**: To change a subscription's billing period, you can click on the existing period, and a list of options will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Customization**: While it's possible to change the name of a billing period, it is recommended not to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Selection**: You can select any billing period that suits your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: The billing period selected in the overview section is automatically pulled into the transaction section, ensuring consistency across the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Automatic Renewal Date Calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

A key feature of the tracker is its ability to automatically calculate the renewal date based on the chosen billing period and the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

For instance, if a Netflix subscription payment was made on September 30th with a monthly billing period set, the tracker will automatically calculate the next renewal date as October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This demonstrates how it precisely calculates the next payment date—whether it's 30 days or a month—from the initial payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The tracker supports various billing frequencies, including annual and weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This aids in [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | tracking subscription transactions and payments]] effectively.

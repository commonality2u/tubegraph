Notion Books Freelancers OS is a comprehensive dashboard designed for freelancers to manage their entire finances, including income and expense details, as well as client management [00:00:12]. This system helps organize various aspects of a freelancing business in one centralized location [00:37:47].

## Dashboard Overview
Upon downloading the setup, users land on a central page that provides quick instructions, including how to change the currency [00:00:27]. The dashboard features two primary navigation windows:
*   **Finance Section** [00:00:48]: Primarily for tracking financial details like income and expenses [00:00:48].
*   **Client Section** [00:00:56]: Dedicated to client management, including invoices, projects, and services [00:01:04].

Navigating between these sections is done via a navigation bar [00:00:54].

### Finance Section Integration
The finance section is crucial for setting up the financial tracking aspect of the system. Any income related to clients should be classified as "client" income to ensure it reflects correctly in the client portal [00:01:44]. Users can also create their own income classifications [00:01:57]. Income transactions booked in the finance setup will automatically appear in the client portal, provided they are classified under "client" [00:02:45].

## Client Management Portal
The client management portal is a robust system offering several key functionalities:

### Main Components
The client section initially displays four main components:
*   Invoicing details [00:03:37]
*   Client details [00:03:39]
*   Project details [00:03:42]
*   Services section [00:03:45]

### Additional Tools
Below the main components, a "Tools" section provides:
*   Resources [00:03:54]
*   Contacts [00:03:59]
*   Goals [00:04:06]
*   Calendar for meeting schedules [00:04:14]

### Workflow Detail
At the bottom of the client section is a "workflow detail" area. This section is filtered to display only income classified under "client" from the finance section [00:04:25]. Users can apply custom filters to view other classifications as needed [00:04:40]. This ensures that only client-related income, and not salary or other non-client income, is displayed here [00:04:50].

## Managing Clients
The system organizes clients into three pipelines:
*   **Lead:** For potential clients [00:05:22].
*   **Negotiation:** For clients currently in discussions [00:05:27].
*   **Client:** For active clients [00:05:32].

Users can add new clients by clicking the "new" option within any category [00:05:39].

### Client Details
When a new client is added, the system allows for the input of various details:
*   Client Name [00:05:51]
*   Invoice Amount [00:06:00]: This amount is automatically pulled from linked invoices [00:06:07]. For example, if two invoices totaling $3,000 are linked to "Client A", this amount will be reflected [00:06:17].
*   Contract Value [00:07:01]: Manually entered by the user, this allows tracking of the total contract value and the percentage of work invoiced against it [00:07:04].
*   Company, Contact Details, Email Address, Position, Stage, and Website details [00:07:51].
*   Work-related details [00:08:11]: Shows linked invoices, their value, and status (e.g., draft) [00:08:13].

Clients can be easily dragged and dropped between pipelines (e.g., from 'Client' to 'Negotiating') [00:09:14].

## Managing Projects
Projects represent specific work orders or tasks performed for a client [00:10:10]. Projects can be categorized by priority:
*   Low Priority [00:10:36]
*   Medium Priority [00:10:38]
*   High Priority [00:10:39]

### Adding Projects and Details
To add a new project, users click the "new" button and provide details such as:
*   Project Name [00:10:51]
*   Project Value [00:11:02]: The estimated value of the project [00:11:08].
*   Completion Date (Start and End dates) [00:11:30].
*   Status: E.g., "Not Started" [00:12:24].

### Project Completion Calculation
Project completion can be calculated in two ways:
1.  **By Hours:** Users can specify estimated hours for a project and then book actual hours completed. The system will calculate completion based on the actual hours against estimated hours [00:14:48].
2.  **By Invoicing:** If no hours are specified, completion is calculated based on the total value of invoices assigned to the project compared to the total project value [00:15:06]. For instance, if a project has a $6,000 value and $3,000 in invoices, it will show 50% completion [00:15:27].

Each project also shows associated client and services [00:16:37].

## Managing Services
Services are the specific offerings provided for each project [00:17:46]. They are categorized by status:
*   Not Started [00:18:01]
*   In Progress [00:18:03]
*   Completed [00:18:05]

### Adding and Detailing Services
Users can add new services, specifying:
*   Service Name [00:18:21]
*   Service Pricing: Can be hourly or a fixed flat rate [00:18:27]. These options are customizable [00:18:32].
*   Service Rate [00:18:46].

Additional details for services include service duration, status, and associated client and project [00:19:37].

## Managing Invoices
The [[creating_and_using_invoice_templates_in_notion | Invoicing section]] allows users to manage and [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | track invoice payments]] and statuses [00:21:17]. Invoices are classified by status:
*   Draft [00:21:23]
*   Sent [00:21:26]
*   Paid [00:21:29]

The section displays the total invoice amount for each category and allows users to count the number of invoices [00:21:33].

### Adding and Linking Invoices
To add a new invoice:
1.  Click "new" in the desired category (e.g., 'Sent') [00:22:07].
2.  Enter the invoice number [00:22:15].
3.  Set a due date [00:22:34].

The invoice amount is automatically populated from the "workflow" section at the bottom of the client portal [00:22:27]. When an income entry in the workflow is linked to an invoice, the invoice amount in the invoicing section updates automatically [00:23:57]. This linking process can also be done in reverse, by creating a new invoice directly from the workflow section, which then automatically adds it to the invoices section [00:25:40].

### Payment Tracking
Users can indicate the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") for an invoice in the workflow section once payment is received [00:27:10]. This automatically updates financial calculations in the finance view [00:27:31]. If payment is not yet received, the payment mode field can be left blank [00:27:10]. This feature supports [[managing_invoices_and_payment_statuses_in_notion | managing invoices and payment statuses in Notion]] and [[automating_invoice_payment_reminders_using_notion | tracking invoice payments in Notion]].

## Additional Tools

### Resources
The Resources section helps organize useful materials for the business [00:28:59]. Resources are categorized as:
*   Checklists [00:29:10]
*   Guides [00:29:11]
*   Strategies [00:29:12]
*   Tips [00:29:13]

Users can add new resources, assign categories (e.g., Taxes, Budgeting), include links, and add notes or to-do lists directly within the resource entry [00:29:14].

### Contacts
The Contact Section allows users to maintain a catalog of business contacts [00:31:30]. Contacts can be categorized (e.g., Finance, Services, Legal) [00:31:41]. For each contact, users can input details such as designation, phone number, address, email ID, and company name [00:31:57]. Categories are customizable [00:32:32].

### Goals
This section helps users set and [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | track personal or business goals]] [00:33:09]. Goals are classified under categories like Health, Wealth, and Relationship [00:33:16]. For each goal, users can set a target number and track progress, which automatically calculates a completion percentage [00:33:39].

### Calendar
The Calendar view provides a quick glance at all scheduled meetings for the month [00:34:24]. Users can:
*   Add new meetings by clicking the plus button on a specific date [00:34:44].
*   Specify the meeting title and agenda [00:34:52].
*   Assign clients or contacts from the existing databases [00:35:07].
*   Select a meeting medium (e.g., Google Meet, Skype) [00:35:32].
*   Attach reference documents or embed links [00:35:48].
*   Assign a priority (Low, Medium, High) [00:36:04].

The calendar view can be customized to display meetings weekly or monthly [00:36:27].

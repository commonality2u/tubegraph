The savings funds tracker provides a dashboard with two primary views to help manage and monitor financial goals: the Savings Target view and the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Savings Target View
This view allows users to define different saving funds and set their corresponding target or goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Default savings categories are included, but users can easily customize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Managing Savings Funds
*   **Editing Existing Funds**: To modify an existing saving fund, click the pencil button next to it. This allows renaming the fund (e.g., changing it to "car fund") and updating the goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Changes automatically update the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Alternatively, clicking directly on the fund's details provides all editing options for name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Adding New Funds**: Click the "add savings" button to create a new savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear, which can then be named (e.g., "new saving fund") and assigned a goal amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Deleting Funds**: To remove a saving fund, click the six dots located on its left side and select the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Savings Overview
The Savings Overview provides a comprehensive summary of total savings made, the aggregated targeted saving amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Tracking Transactions and Progress
To update the savings overview, users interact with the [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals | transactions panel]] at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Transactions**: Clicking "add transaction" automatically generates a new entry with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals | Transactions]] are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Users can also manually set a different date using the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Linking Transactions to Funds**: For each transaction, details can be entered (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Users then select the specific saving fund the transaction applies to from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Once a saving amount is entered for a transaction, it automatically updates the total savings for that fund in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For example, if a car fund had $1,400 saved, adding a $1,000 transaction would update the total to $2,400, reflecting the progress towards the goal (e.g., 80% achieved for a $3,000 goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Dynamic Views for Savings Tracking
The transaction view is highly dynamic and can be customized to show performance over different periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Grouping Options**: By default, transactions are grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, by clicking the three dots next to the view, users can change the grouping to "week" or "year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This allows users to see their savings performance on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This flexibility helps in [[tracking_monthly_performance_and_hours | tracking monthly performance]] and overall progress.

## Customization and Support
The tracker supports different currencies. By clicking on any amount, users can access the "edit property" option, which allows selecting various currency formats supported by Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Assistance is available for setting up the template in a different currency post-purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The entire template is designed to be dynamic and customizable to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

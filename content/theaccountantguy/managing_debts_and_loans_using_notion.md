The Notion personal finance tracker includes a dedicated system for [[how_to_use_notion_for_tracking_debt_payments | tracking debt payments]] and managing loans, offering a comprehensive overview of your financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This setup allows for detailed tracking of upcoming and past payments, total debt, and amounts paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts

To begin [[tracking_debt_payments_using_notion | tracking debt payments using Notion]], navigate to the "Account" section within the "Get Started View" of the Notion tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

1.  **Access Liabilities**: Go to the "Liabilities" section, as all debts are classified as liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
2.  **Add or Modify Debt**:
    *   To add a new debt, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

    *   **Payment Frequency**: Set how often payments are expected (e.g., monthly, annually, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Entering Debt Transactions

After setting up debt accounts, the next step in [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | creating a Notion debt tracker]] is to record transactions related to debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Transactions**: Go to the "Transactions" section and select the "Liability" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This view displays all debt-related payments and other liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
2.  **Add New Transaction**: Click "New" to open a new transaction window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
3.  **Input Transaction Details**:
    *   **Date**: Select the date of the payment or loan acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Transactions are automatically organized by month in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Choose the specific debt account (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the payment was made (e.g., "Bank" or "Cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   **Transaction Type**:
        *   **Outflow**: Select "Outflow" when repaying a loan, as money is going out of your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
        *   **Inflow**: Select "Inflow" if you are obtaining a new loan, as money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
4.  **Balance Updates**: The total loan amount for that debt will automatically update based on the repayment or new loan amount entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The system combines opening balances with all inflow and outflow transactions to calculate the current debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments

To track specific details about debt payments, navigate to the "Summary" section and select the "Debt" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This section provides two main views:

### Upcoming Payments

This view displays all debt payments that are due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. It shows the next payment due date for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Past Payments

This view reflects payments that were due in the past and might have been missed or are awaiting recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. If a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) has been set for a debt, and no transaction has been recorded for the intermediary period, the system will reflect this by showing the last payment date in this section, indicating a potential missed payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Detailed Debt Overview

For each debt, the following information is displayed:
*   **Total Loan Amount**: The cumulative loan amount taken, which is the sum of the opening balance and any additional loans obtained during the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Total Repayment**: The amount repaid so far, displayed both as a percentage and a monetary value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Next Payment Date**: For upcoming payments, this indicates when the next payment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Last Payment Date**: For past payments, this shows when the last payment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Customizing the Debt View

You can customize the appearance of the [[using_notion_for_debt_management_and_tracking_debt_payments | debt management and tracking debt payments]] view to suit your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>:
*   **Layout**: Change the layout from the default board view to a list or gallery format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Properties**: Enable or disable desired properties (e.g., total amount paid, repayment percentage) to be displayed in the chosen layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Grouping and Sorting**: Group by "Payment Status" and sort manually to prioritize "Upcoming Payments" over "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

The paycheck budget tracker is designed to help users track their [[tracking_paycheck_payments | paycheck payments]] and budget them correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Sections of the Tracker

The tracker is divided into two primary [[sections_of_the_paycheck_tracker_template | sections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

### Summary Section
Located on the left side, the summary section displays key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expenses set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Account Section
Located on the right side, the account section allows users to add their own expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Expenses can be categorized under three default heads, which are [[components_of_budget_tracker_template | components of the budget tracker template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Users have the flexibility to customize these expense heads by clicking on them and setting their own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. After adding accounts, users can set a budgeted amount for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up accounts and budgeted amounts, users proceed to the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Here, all transactions related to every expense can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These transactions then reflect under the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, expenses incurred, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[using_a_personal_finance_tracker_spreadsheet | using a personal finance tracker spreadsheet]] effectively.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction**: Automatically adds a new transaction with the current date, allowing users to feed in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source**: Automatically adds a new expense under one of the existing heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. New expense sources initially appear under "Fixed Expenses" but can be moved to any other category using the three-dots menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The template provided offers dedicated sections for [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | tracking transactions]] and analyzing profit and loss for business inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This includes detailed views for purchases and sales, as well as a direct calculation of profit or loss for each sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Transaction Section Overview

The transaction section is divided into purchases, sales, and a profit and loss view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Purchases

The purchases section organizes entries by date, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
When adding a new purchase, users can input:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Account/Inventory** (e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Number of Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Purchase Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The total cost is automatically populated based on price and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status** for the particular transaction (e.g., in transit, in progress, not sent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This status can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
A quick action button labeled "buy inventory" automatically adds a purchase to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Sales

The sales section functions similarly to the purchases section, allowing users to record details of inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit & Loss

For each sale recorded, the profit and loss section requires input of the **purchase price** or **cost of manufacturing** for the item sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, if bread was sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, inputting $10 will automatically calculate the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This calculation extends to the total profit for multiple units, e.g., $30 profit per unit multiplied by 30 units gives $900 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The Notion business budget template helps businesses track their expenses and manage budgeting effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template allows users to stay within their allocated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template features a "Business Expenses Summary" at the top, divided into three main sections: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section

In the Account section, users can set up different expense categories under heads like Operational, Administration, or Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Adding Categories**: To add a new category, scroll to the right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories**: Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Amount**: After setting up expenses, a budgeted amount can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Expenses Section

This section displays current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **Updates**: Expenses are updated as transactions are entered in the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Visual Cues**:
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of the financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects:

*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense set so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Transaction Section

The Transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is used for booking expenses under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

*   **Organization**: Expenses are categorized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Quick Expense Entry**: Buttons on the left side (e.g., "Operational expense button") allow for quick addition of expenses with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Users can then add a description, associate the expense to relevant accounts, and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Date Adjustment**: The date of an expense can be changed by clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Expense Sources/Accounts**:
    *   A "quick button" at the top allows for adding a different expense source under each head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, the "new" button/icon helps quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, to add a new account under the operational category, click the "new" button, enter details, and the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

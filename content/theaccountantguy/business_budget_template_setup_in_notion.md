This article outlines how to utilize a Notion business budget template to track and manage business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template is designed to help businesses stay within their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The top section of the template is the Business Expenses Summary, which comprises three main parts: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section

In the Account section, you can set up different expense categories under heads like Operational, Administration, or Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Adding a new category**: Scroll to the right and click the plus (+) icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Editing an existing category**: Click on any category to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Setting budgeted amounts**: After setting up expense categories, you specify the budgeted amount for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The Expenses section displays current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **Tracking progress**: Expenses update automatically as transactions are entered into the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Visual indicators**:
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of your financial status regarding expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects:

*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Transaction Section

The Transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is where you book expenses under each head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

*   **Quickly adding an expense**: Use the dedicated buttons on the left (e.g., "Operational Expense" button) to quickly add a new expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Enter a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Associate the expense with the relevant account by clicking on the account field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Changing expense dates**: If an expense was added on an incorrect date, simply click on the date field and change it as needed, and it will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Adding new accounts or expenses**:
    *   A "quick button" at the top allows you to add an expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, click the "New" button/icon to quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, to add a new account under the operational category, click the "New" button and input the details and budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The debt payment tracker is designed to help users pay off their debts efficiently by providing tools for managing installments and payment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Debt Overview

The debt overview section organizes debts into different categories, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key details available for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount** (Equated Monthly Installment) – the amount paid per installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment Date** – the first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   **Debt-Free By Calculation** – an estimated date for becoming debt-free if payments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of EMIs** – total installments required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

### Managing Payment Frequencies
Users can add new debt categories and payment frequencies, such as "weekly," by clicking an "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The system automatically inserts the new repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Existing payment schedules include quarterly and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Debts can be moved to different repayment schedules, which automatically updates the repayment schedule and other relevant calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This feature is part of [[setting_up_debt_categories_and_payment_frequencies | setting up debt categories and payment frequencies]].

### Adding and Editing Debt Details
*   **Adding New Debt**: A "add details" button allows for quick addition of new debts, initially categorized under "no payment frequency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Once a frequency is selected, users can enter specific debt details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debt**: Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field, and changes automatically update across all associated columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

The "Debt Payoff Progress" section provides an [[overview_of_debt_payment_tracker | overview]] of all added loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It tracks:
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: This figure updates automatically as installments are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: Shows the proportion of total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Debt-Free By Date**: A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount Paid**: The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount Repaid**: The portion of payments allocated to the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

All these metrics update automatically when payment details are added or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section displays all debt payments made, organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It provides a summation of all EMIs paid for each particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

For each payment, the following details are tracked:
*   **Paid Status**: A checkbox indicates if the amount has been paid. Checking or unchecking this box updates the payment status and moves it between paid and unpaid sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is part of [[tracking_payment_details_and_amounts_due | tracking payment details and amounts due]].
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details**: Allows selection of a specific loan from those added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   **Next Repayment Schedule**: Automatically calculated based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, a monthly student loan paid on September 30 will show an October 30 next payment, while an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will show September 27, 2024, as the next payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment to the schedule using the current date, allowing users to input details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

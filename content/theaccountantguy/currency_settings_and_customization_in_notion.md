In the Notion employee training expenses tracker, all currencies are editable and [[Customizing Notion templates for financial tracking | customizable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Changing Currency in Database Properties

To change the currency format within a database property:
1.  Navigate to the relevant view, such as the "Training Expenses" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  Change the view to "Table View" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
3.  Click on the column (e.g., "Expense") where the currency is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
4.  Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
5.  Click on the "Number format" option, which might initially show "US Dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
6.  Choose any desired currency from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

This method allows for [[Customizing databases in Notion | customizing databases in Notion]] to reflect different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Adjusting Dashboard Currency Symbols

For currency displayed directly in the dashboard's aggregated information (e.g., "Total Expense," "Average Expense"):
*   Click on the information display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   The dollar sign or currency symbol is often embedded within the formula for that display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   This symbol can be customized to suit your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

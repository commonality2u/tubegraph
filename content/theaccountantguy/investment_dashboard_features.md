A personal finance tracker developed in Google Sheets includes an [[portfolio_tracker | investment dashboard]] designed to provide a dynamic and real-time overview of an individual's investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This dashboard automatically updates various metrics as market trading occurs, eliminating the need for manual data entry for real-time values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **Purchase Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

Once these are entered, the rest of the calculations and visualizations update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

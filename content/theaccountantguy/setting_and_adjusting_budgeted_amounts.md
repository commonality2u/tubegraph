The Business Expense Tracker is designed to help users manage their business expenses under a single general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A core function of the tracker is the ability to [[setting_budget_categories | define]], set, and adjust budgeted amounts for various expenses.

## Defining Expense Categories and Setting Budgets

Before setting budgeted amounts, users define their [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The tracker provides some predefined business expense categories, which can be modified or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Modifying and Adding Categories
*   **Modifying Categories**: To change a main category, click on the category name and then 'done' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories**: Subcategories can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: Users can add new categories by clicking the 'new' button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Once categories are established, you can [[setting_budget_categories | set the budgeted amount]] for each expense type directly within the expense categories section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Automatic Reflection in Overview
Any budgeted amount set in the expense categories will automatically be reflected in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This overview displays the total expenses incurred, the [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expenses]] that were set, and a percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is still within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Adjusting Budgeted Amounts and Dynamic Updates
The system allows for easy [[setting_and_tracking_budget_goals_with_notion | adjustment of budgeted amounts]]. For instance, if the budget for "advertising" is changed from $100 to $5,000, all relevant figures in the expenses overview will update automatically to reflect this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This dynamic updating ensures that all financial summaries remain current with the latest budget adjustments.

## Expense Transaction Entry
While not directly related to setting budgets, the tracker also allows for detailed entry of individual transactions. Users can input:
*   The date of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   A description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   The associated account (which can be edited or added) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This data feeds into the overall [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budget tracking]] functionality.

## Budget Summary and Analysis
After entering transactions, a summary on the left-hand side provides a quick overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This summary includes:
*   The [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   The total actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The percentage of the [[calculating_expense_differences_and_budget_percentages | budgeted expense]] that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

This allows for effective [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | tracking of budgeted vs. actual expenses]] and supports the overall goal of [[updating_and_managing_budget_summaries | managing business expenses]].

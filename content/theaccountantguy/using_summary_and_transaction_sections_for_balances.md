The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker is a tool designed to track customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tracker comprises various sections, including detailed account views, a comprehensive [[summary_section_of_notion_bills_tracker | summary section]], and a [[managing_billing_periods_and_transaction_details | transaction section]] for detailed entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Accounts Receivable and Payable Sections

At the top of the tracker, there's a receivable and payable account section with four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Accounts View
The "accounts view" allows users to set up customer and vendor details, including their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. New customers or vendors can be added using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Once details are added, users can input the opening balance (starting receivable or payable balance) and any pending invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Receivable Section
This section displays all receivable accounts and their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows all transactions carried out, such as invoices raised against customers, including the date and invoice amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Users can change the invoice status (e.g., paid, outstanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A checkbox allows users to mark an invoice as paid, which automatically adjusts the outstanding balance displayed at the top for each customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Payable Section
Similar to the receivable section, the payable section provides details for each transaction, including the invoice date, invoice number, status, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Marking an invoice as paid here also helps in tracking the outstanding amount on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

The [[summary_section_of_notion_bills_tracker | summary section]] offers an overall summary of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This section reflects the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance, all calculated from the transactions entered in the section below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This allows for [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | tracking payment totals]] across all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transaction section]] is divided into three segments: receivable, payable, and quarterly summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Receivable Segment
In the receivable segment, users can input details such as the transaction date, billing period (categorized into quarters), description, account name (customer), amount, invoice number, and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Once these details are entered, they automatically update the relevant sections at the top of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A "paid" checkbox in this section indicates if an amount has been paid, and if checked, it won't be reflected in the total outstanding balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Quick action buttons allow for adding new receivable entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Transactions are bated into months, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Segment
Similar to the receivable segment, the payable segment allows for entering detailed payable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. A quick action button facilitates adding new payable entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The quarterly summary provides a consolidated overview of all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable less payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This provides a quarterly overview of the financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The total amount is also reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

By utilizing these detailed account, summary, and [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction sections]], users can get a quick overview of their overall receivable and payable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

When [[creating_a_database_in_notion | creating a database in Notion]], various properties can be assigned to categorize and interact with data within that database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These properties define the type of information each entry holds and how it can be used, for example, in calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Common Property Types in Databases

A typical database set up for calculations might include several different property types to manage inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Title Property

The first property in a database often serves as a unique identifier or name for each entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is known as a **Title property** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For instance, in an example demonstrating multiplication, this property might be named "Name of the operator" to describe the operation being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Number Property

To handle numerical inputs, a **Number property** is assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Each number intended for calculation within a database entry would have its own dedicated Number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, two numbers for a product calculation would each have a Number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Formula Property

A **Formula property** is used to perform calculations or display dynamic content based on other properties within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It takes existing property values as inputs to produce a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

There are different ways to set up formulas:
*   **Using a dedicated operator function**: A formula can utilize specific operator functions, such as `multiply()`, by providing the input numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance, inputting 2 and 3 into the `multiply()` operator formula yields 6 as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Using arithmetic symbols**: Alternatively, formulas can directly use arithmetic symbols, such as the asterisk `*` for multiplication, placed between the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both methods allow for calculating the product of two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

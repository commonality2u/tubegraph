This guide explains how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet to [[Tracking income and expenses | track income and expense details]] and analyze them, primarily focusing on the [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | dashboard tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Structure

The spreadsheet includes three main tabs:
*   The [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | Dashboard tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   The Transactions Tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   The [[Navigating the budget tab for income and expense details | Budget tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Before utilizing the dashboard, initial setup and data entry are required in the other tabs.

## Initial Setup: Budget Tab

First, navigate to the [[Navigating the budget tab for income and expense details | Budget tab]] to input details related to income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here, you specify the budgeted amount for each month for both income goals and [[Tracking and analyzing actual versus budgeted expenses | budgeted expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Accounts are categorized as either "income" or "expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The "goal amount" column is formula-driven, totaling the monthly entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. New line items can be added by dragging down the formula or by simply adding new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Recording Transactions: Transactions Tab

After setting up the budget, record individual transactions in the Transactions Tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For each transaction, you can enter the date, details, and category (linking to the accounts defined in the budget tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A formula-driven property in column E specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The amount for each transaction is also entered here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Dashboard Analysis

The [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | dashboard section]] provides comprehensive [[Using dynamic reporting for personal finance analysis | analysis of income and expenses]] based on the data entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. All analysis on the dashboard is controlled by filters for:
*   Category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

### Key Dashboard Views

1.  **Summary of Income and Expenses**:
    *   By filtering for a specific period (e.g., "2023 entire period") and "all accounts," you can view the total [[Income and Expense Tracking Features | income detail]], total expense amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

2.  **[[Analyzing income sources and earnings | Income Overview]]**:
    *   This section details the [[Analyzing income sources and earnings | different sources of income]] earned during the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

3.  **Expenses Overview**:
    *   Similar to the income overview, this provides a breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

4.  **Monthly Personal Finance Overview**:
    *   On the right side of the dashboard, you can see the [[Income and Expense Tracking Features | income and expense detail]] for each month and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

5.  **Status Callout**:
    *   A status callout indicates whether expenses have been exceeded or not, based on budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Dynamic Filtering Examples

The dashboard allows for dynamic adjustments to its views:
*   To see the total [[Analyzing income sources and earnings | income detail]] for an entire period across all accounts, apply the relevant filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   You can change the category to view [[Analyzing income sources and earnings | individual sources of income]], such as "salary," which will update the entire dashboard view to reflect only that specific income source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | dashboard section]] is designed to help perform detailed [[Using dynamic reporting for personal finance analysis | analysis of income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

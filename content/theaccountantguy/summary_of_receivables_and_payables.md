The [[accounts_receivable_and_payable_tracker_setup | accounts receivable and payable tracker]] is a tool designed to manage customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive overview of financial transactions related to money owed to the business (receivables) and money the business owes to others (payables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accounts View

This section allows users to set up customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Key information includes:
*   Opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Number of invoices due against the opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

Quick action buttons are available on the left to quickly add a new vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> or customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Details can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Users then input the starting balance (opening balance) for receivables or payables, and any pending invoices against that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Receivable Section

This view reflects all receivable accounts and their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows:
*   Customer details (e.g., Sandra, Harry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   All transactions carried out, including invoices raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Invoice status, which can be changed among three options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Invoice amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

A checkbox indicates if an invoice has been paid; checking it removes the amount from the total outstanding balance at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For each customer, the outstanding amount is reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Payable Section

Similar to the receivable section, the payable section displays details for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
*   Date of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   Amount raised against the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

A paid/unpaid checkbox helps find the outstanding balance at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

This section provides an overall summary of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   Net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

These figures are calculated from the transactions entered in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is divided into three segments:
1.  **Receivable Segment**:
    *   Includes date, period (selectable in quarters), description, account name, amount, invoice number, and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   Details fed here automatically update throughout the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   A 'paid' checkbox indicates if the amount has been paid and if it should be excluded from total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Quick action button to add a receivable entry, which defaults to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   Details are categorized by month, with later months appearing on top, and an indication of the number of transactions per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

2.  **Payable Segment**:
    *   Similar to the receivable segment, it provides details for payable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   Includes a 'paid' column to mark if an amount has been settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   A quick action button allows adding a payable entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

3.  **Quarterly Summary**:
    *   This section provides a combined summary for all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable less payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   A slider allows navigation through quarters, with the total amounts reflected at the top for an overall quarterly overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

This article explains how to calculate the product of two numbers within a [[notion | Notion]] database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It demonstrates the use of different [[notion | Notion]] properties and [[formulas for multiplication in Notion | formulas]] for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup for Product Calculation

To perform calculations, a database in [[notion | Notion]] is set up with specific properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
*   **Name of the operator**: This property is a title property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Number properties**: Two separate number properties are assigned for the numbers to be multiplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This is crucial for [[understanding_and_setting_property_types_in_notion_databases | understanding and setting property types in Notion databases]].

## Methods for [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | Calculating the Product of Numbers in Notion]]

Two distinct [[formulas for multiplication in Notion | formulas]] can be used to calculate the product of two numbers in a [[notion | Notion]] database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

This method involves a specific "multiply operator formula" where the two number properties are provided as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Example**: If the numbers 2 and 3 are provided as input, this formula will yield the product as 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol

Another approach is to use a [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] that simply multiplies the two numbers using the standard multiply symbol (`*`) placed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This article outlines how a dedicated [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | debt payment tracker]] can be utilized to manage and pay off debts effectively, as demonstrated by Anat Biswal, "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The tracker is designed to help users systematically manage their financial obligations and monitor their progress towards becoming debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section provides a categorized breakdown of debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Debts are initially divided into "annual payment" and "monthly payments" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key details tracked for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount:** The installment amount to be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment:** The first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   **Debt Free By:** A calculated date showing when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Number of EMIs:** The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

### Customizing Categories
Users can add new payment categories, such as "weekly" or "quarterly," by clicking an "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Existing debts can be moved between different repayment schedules, and the repayment schedule and other details will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Managing Debt Details
New debts can be quickly added to a "no payment frequency" column via an "added details" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once moved to a specific frequency, details can be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field, with changes automatically updating across all relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress Section

This section offers a comprehensive summary of [[monitoring_debt_payment_and_loan_repayment_progress | debt repayment progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It displays:
*   **Total Loans on Hand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   **Total Amount Repaid:** Calculated from installments paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage:** The percentage of the total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   **Debt Free By Date:** A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

*   **Principal Amount Repaid:** The total principal paid towards the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>

All these progress metrics update automatically as installment payments are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" is where users can [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | track]] individual debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section
This area reflects all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It provides a summation of all EMIs paid for each particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Columns in this section include:
*   **Paid Status:** A checkbox to mark if an amount has been paid. Ticking or unticking this automatically moves the payment between "paid" and "unpaid" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details:** Allows selection of a specific loan added earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   **Next Repayment Schedule:** Automatically calculated based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a monthly student loan payment made on September 30 will show the next payment on October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, while an annual home loan payment on September 27, 2023, will show the next payment on the same date in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Users can click the "pay debt amount" button to automatically add a new debt payment to the schedule, set to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Details and descriptions can then be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. All changes made in the transaction section, such as adjusting an EMI amount, automatically update the "Debt Payoff Progress" summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

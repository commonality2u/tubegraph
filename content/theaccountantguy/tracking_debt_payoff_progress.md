This article demonstrates how to utilize a [[tracking_debt_payments_using_notion | debt payment tracker]] to manage and pay off debts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debt, primarily into annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Key details specified for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount**: The installment amount to be paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: Customizable by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment Date**: The first payment date for the loan installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date showing when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: Indicates the total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Managing Debt Categories

Users can add new debt categories (e.g., "weekly") by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Pre-added payment schedules, including quarterly and weekly repayments, are also available for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules, which automatically updates the repayment schedule and other related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To quickly add a new debt, click "added details," which initially places it in the "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Users can then move it to the desired frequency and input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field, with changes automatically updating across all relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

This section provides a summary of the overall [[tracking_debt_payments_using_notion | debt payoff progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It reflects:
*   All existing loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: Automatically updated based on recorded installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: Shows the proportion of total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount**: The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount**: The portion of the repaid amount applied to the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Repayments are split into interest and principal amounts, which are reported at the bottom of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. All these values update automatically as payment details are added or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section allows users to track all [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | debt payments]] made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section

This section displays all paid debts, organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It includes a summation of all EMIs paid for each particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Columns within this section include:
*   **Paid Checkbox**: Ticking this automatically updates the payment status from "unpaid" to "paid" and reflects it in the paid installment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Payment Date**: User-definable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan Details**: Allows selection of a specific loan from those added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule**: Automatically calculated based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a monthly student loan paid on September 30th will show October 30th as the next payment, while an annual home loan paid on September 27th, 2023, will show September 27th, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

A "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule based on the current date, allowing users to input details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Updates in the transaction section, such as changing an EMI amount, are immediately reflected in the overall [[tracking_debt_payments_using_notion | debt payoff progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

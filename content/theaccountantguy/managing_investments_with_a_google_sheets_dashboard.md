A Google Sheets-based personal finance tracker includes an investment dashboard designed to reflect all held investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This dashboard is dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, with many values updating automatically once key information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Key Features and Functionality

To utilize the investment dashboard, users primarily input the investment symbol, the number of shares, and the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Real-Time Updates
Once a symbol is entered, the price and corresponding graph automatically update in real-time as trading occurs in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This means no manual entries are needed for price changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. For example, entering "Apple" as a symbol instantly updates its price and graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Comprehensive Investment Overview
The dashboard provides a quick representation of various investment parameters, allowing users to view their entire investments at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Key metrics include:
*   Market value of the held symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
*   Cost and market value analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   Growth of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
*   Portfolio value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Portfolio gain, both in absolute value and percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   Dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Total holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

All these parameters update in real-time with market trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This article explores how a dedicated [[film_production_budget_tracking | film production budget tracker]] can be utilized to manage and analyze expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Expense Tracking Overview

The template features a table that systematically lists individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Each entry includes:
*   The respective category of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Users can define and update their own categories using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The template also allows for updating the budgeted expense value directly within the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Once these values are updated, all related figures in the template are automatically refreshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Similarly, entering an amount on the expense side also updates the tracker dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Summary Section for Analysis

The tracker includes a [[using_the_summary_section_in_notion_expense_tracker | summary section]] designed to provide a comprehensive overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses relative to the budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This summary provides an [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | overall expense summary]], allowing for quick comparison of current spending against the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Category Management

Users have full control over expense categories:
*   **Adding New Categories:** A "new page" option is available to add new categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories:** Categories can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories:** Categories can be deleted via a three-dot menu option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

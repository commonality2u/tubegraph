Notion Books Freelancers OS is a dashboard designed for freelancers to track their finances and manage clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Upon downloading the setup, users will find a quick set of instructions, including how to change the currency and a tutorial on using the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The system has two main navigation windows: Finance and Client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Navigating the Client Section

The Client section of the dashboard can be accessed by clicking "Client" in the navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This section provides a comprehensive portal for [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Initial Setup for Client Income
Before moving to the client section, it's important to understand how income is classified in the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Any income related to a client can be added and classified as "client" within the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This classification ensures that these income transactions reflect correctly in the [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | client portal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Users can also create their own income classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Client Section Overview
The client section is organized into several key areas:
*   **Invoicing Details**: Tracks all invoice-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Client Details**: Manages information for all clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Project Details**: Organizes ongoing and past projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Services Section**: Lists services offered to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Tools Section**: Includes [[organizing_resources_and_contacts_in_notion | resources]], [[organizing_resources_and_contacts_in_notion | contacts]], goals, and a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Workflow Detail**: Displays all client-related income, filtered from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Managing Client Details
Client details are organized into a pipeline reflecting their engagement stage:
*   **Lead**: Potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Negotiation**: Clients in the negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Client**: Current active clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

New clients can be added by clicking the "New" option within any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. When adding a client, users specify the client name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Key parameters displayed for each client:
*   **Invoice Amount**: Automatically pulls from invoices linked to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Value**: Manually entered by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Invoiced Percentage**: Automatically calculated based on the invoice amount relative to the contract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Clicking on a client's entry opens a new window with more details:
*   Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
*   Email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   Position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Stage (Lead, Negotiation, Client) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Website details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Work-related details (linked invoices and their statuses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

Clients can be dragged and dropped between different pipeline categories (e.g., from 'Client' to 'Negotiating') for flexible classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Managing Projects
The Projects section helps track all work performed to fulfill client contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects can be categorized by priority:
*   Low Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   Medium Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
*   High Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

To add a new project, click "New" and specify the project name, project value, and a completion date (which can be a single date or a date range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The project's status can be updated (e.g., "Not started") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

When viewing project details, users can update the status and priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Project completion can be calculated in two ways:
1.  **Hourly Basis**: By specifying estimated hours and booking actual hours, the system calculates the completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
2.  **Invoicing Basis**: By assigning total project value and linking invoices, the completion percentage is calculated based on the invoiced amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
Projects are linked to specific clients and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Managing Services
Services represent the specific offerings provided for each project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Services are categorized by their status:
*   Not Started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>
*   Completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>

When adding a new service, users specify the service name, pricing model (hourly or fixed flat rate fees), and the service rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Service details include the service duration, rate, status, and associated client and project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### [[setting_up_notion_for_invoice_management | Invoice Management]]
The [[setting_up_notion_for_invoice_management | invoicing]] section tracks the status of invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>:
*   **Draft**: Invoices that are still being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Sent**: Invoices that have been sent to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Paid**: Invoices for which payment has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

The total invoice amount is displayed, and users can view the number of invoices in each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. To add a new invoice, specify the invoice number and due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Workflow Section
The workflow section acts as a central hub, displaying all client-related income carried over from the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For each income entry, users can link:
*   **Invoice**: Assign a specific invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Client**: Link the income to the relevant client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Project**: Associate the income with a specific project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Service**: Connect the income to the service provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

Adding details in the workflow section automatically populates and updates the corresponding information in the Invoicing, Client, Project, and Services sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Users can also create new invoices, clients, projects, or services directly from the workflow section if they haven't been set up in their respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. The "payment mode" indicates if money has been received, which updates the finance view for banking calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

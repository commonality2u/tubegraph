This article outlines how to track and manage personal debt and liabilities using a Notion-based financial management system. The system provides tools for [[databases_needed_for_debt_tracking | setting up accounts]], entering payment transactions, and viewing [[debt_payment_tracking and reporting | progress]] through various summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This is part of a broader system for [[tracking_assets_liabilities_and_net_worth_in_business | tracking assets, liabilities, and net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts

To begin [[managing_debts_and_loans_in_notion | managing debts]], accounts must first be set up in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Accounts Section:** Access the "account" section within the "get started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
2.  **Go to Liabilities:** Select the "liabilities" part where all liabilities are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
3.  **Add New Debt:**
    *   Click the "new" button to add a new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   Enter the name of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Specify any opening balance for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Classify the account as "debt" from the available four classifications (bills, savings, subscription, debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
    *   Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
4.  **Edit Existing Debt:** To modify an existing debt, click the pencil icon next to it, which opens an edit window for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Entering Debt Payment Transactions

After setting up debt accounts, the next step is to record [[managing_debt_payment_transactions | debt payment transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Transactions:** Head to the "liability" section under the "transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
2.  **Add New Transaction:** Click "new" to add a new debt payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
3.  **Enter Details:**
    *   Select the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month, with later months appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   Select the specific debt account (e.g., home loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   Choose the payment mode (e.g., bank, cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   Set the transaction type:
        *   **Outflow:** For repaying a loan, as money is going out of the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
        *   **Inflow:** For obtaining a new loan, as money is coming into the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    *   Input the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The total loan amount will automatically update based on repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Important Notes on Transactions
*   The system tracks the opening balance, new loan inflows, and repayment outflows to show the current outstanding debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments and Reporting

The system offers a dedicated [[debt_overview_and_payment_schedule_setup | debt section]] for comprehensive [[debt_payment_tracking_and_reporting | tracking and reporting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

    *   **Past Payments:** Shows debts where the last payment date indicates a missed payment or a payment due in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This helps identify overdue payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
3.  **Debt Information Displayed:**

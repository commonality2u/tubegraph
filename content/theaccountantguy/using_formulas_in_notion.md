This article details how to find the difference between two numbers in Notion, utilizing two distinct formula methods: the subtract operator and the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Database Setup

To begin, you need to [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | create a database]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

1.  Type a forward slash (`/`) and then `database` to bring up a list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  The first property in your database will be the title property, which indicates the purpose of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Assign number properties to two different columns where your numbers are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Methods to Find the Difference

Once your database is set up with numbers, you can apply formulas to calculate the difference.

### Using the Subtract Operator

The subtract operator is one way to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

*   This operator takes two numbers as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   For example, by providing `number one` and `number two` as input, you can obtain their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Another method is to use the minus sign (`-`) to find the difference between the two numbers in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This demonstrates how to calculate the difference between two numbers within a Notion database using formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

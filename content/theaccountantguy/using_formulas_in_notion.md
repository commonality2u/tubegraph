[[using_notion_for_calculations | Using Notion for calculations]] can simplify data management by automating calculations within databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This article focuses on calculating the product of two numbers within a Notion database using two distinct formula methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Calculating the Product of Two Numbers

To demonstrate product calculation, a database is set up with specific properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Database Setup

The example database includes:
*   **Name of the operator** A title property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Two Number Properties** Each number is assigned a number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Formula Properties** For calculating the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Methods for Multiplication

Two different formulas can be used to calculate the product of two numbers:

#### Method 1: Using the "Multiply Operator" Formula

This method involves a specific "multiply operator formula" where the two numbers are provided as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Example**: Providing `2` and `3` as numbers yields `6` as the product using this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

#### Method 2: Using the Multiplication Symbol

A simpler approach involves placing the multiplication symbol (`*`) directly between the two numbers in a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Both methods effectively calculate the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

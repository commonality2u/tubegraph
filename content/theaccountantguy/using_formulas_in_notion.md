[[using_excelstyle_formulas_in_notion | Notion formulas]] can be used to find the difference between two numbers in a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process utilizes [[using_rollup_and_formula_properties_in_notion | formula properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Methods for Finding the Difference

Two primary methods can be employed to calculate the difference between numbers in Notion:
*   Using the `subtract` operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Using the minus sign (-) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Setting up the Database

To begin, create a database by typing a forward slash (/) and selecting the 'database' option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The first property in the database is typically the title property, which indicates the purpose of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Next, assign number properties to two different numbers within the database to prepare for calculating their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Using the Subtract Operator

A [[using_rollup_and_formula_properties_in_notion | formula property]] can be used with the `subtract` operator to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The `subtract` operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, by providing "number one" and "number two" as inputs, their difference can be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Using the Minus Sign (-)

Alternatively, the minus sign (-) can be used in a [[using_rollup_and_formula_properties_in_notion | formula property]] to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This method achieves the same result as the `subtract` operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

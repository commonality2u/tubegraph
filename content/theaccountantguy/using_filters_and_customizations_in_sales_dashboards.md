The Sales Performance OS is a comprehensive template designed for tracking and managing sales data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template provides a dashboard that can be entirely [[customizing_notion_dashboards_and_views | customized]] to fit specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Components

The sales dashboard features three primary components at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

1.  **Salesperson Performance**: This section displays the sales made by each salesperson per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each person, it shows achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of targeted sales received, and whether the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, while "Target not achieved" indicates sales are below the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An overview on the left provides total sales, sales units, and average sales per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
2.  **Sales Channel Performance**: This component tracks sales from various sources, also broken down by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Examples include website, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Users can add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It shows achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A separate overview displays total sales, sales units, and average sales for each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  **Sales Location Performance**: This section details sales made to different locations, with the same characteristics as the other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It also offers an overview showing total sales, average sales, and sales units per location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

All three components are segmented by month, allowing for detailed tracking of sales across different dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Managing Sales Transactions

Sales transactions can be added directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For each transaction, users can input:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   Account details (salesperson or relevant party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
*   Sales details (what is being sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Salesperson details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   Client details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Unique sales code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Sales Target (set at the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Sales Amount and Sales Unit (entered as sales are made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

Quick action buttons on the left sidebar allow users to automatically assign targets for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> and quickly add transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Customization and Filtering Options

This sales dashboard allows for significant [[customizing_and_managing_sales_data | customization]] and [[using_filters_and_categories_to_manage_financial_data | filtering]] to provide tailored insights:

### General Customization
*   **Adding Custom Categories**: New sales channels can be added by clicking "new" in the sales channel section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Editing Salesperson Details**: Users can instantly edit salesperson names directly from the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Clicking on a detail opens a new window where users can modify information and even set a custom cover image for each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Adding Months/Years**: Users can create new months or select existing years for data entry and tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Client Information**: Client names can be entered, and more detailed client information (address, city, state) can be added in a dedicated client dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Currency Customization
The currency of the entire dashboard can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. To change the currency sign on the dashboard, simply click on it and select the preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For all amount fields, the currency can be updated by clicking on the amount, selecting "edit property," and then changing the "number format" to the desired currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Filtering by Date (Year, Month)
The dashboard allows for powerful filtering to view specific periods:
*   **Filtering by Year**: Users can add a filter and select a particular year to automatically display only data relevant to that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Filtering by Month**: Similarly, a filter can be applied to view data for specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Combined Filters**: It's possible to use a combination of filters, such as viewing all months within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These filters enable users to see more detailed performance metrics of their sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

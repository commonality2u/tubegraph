The customer payments tracker is a simple template designed to [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | keep track of all customer payments]] in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Summary Section

Located on the left side of the tracker, the summary section provides key financial figures at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It displays:
*   The total amount of payment that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The total payment amount that was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The difference between the due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The percentage of total payments that was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Main Sections

The right side of the template is divided into three primary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
1.  Customer Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
2.  Overview Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
3.  Transaction Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

### Customer Section

This section allows users to [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | set up an entire customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is organized into three default sub-sections for categorizing customers:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Users can edit existing sub-sections or add new ones by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Within each sub-section, individual customers are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For each customer, the total payment amount due is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The template provides functionalities to:
*   Edit the total payment amount due for any customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Edit customer names using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Add new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Delete customers by clicking on a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Overview Section

Once the customer database and payment amounts due are entered, the overview section provides a summary of payment statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It shows:
*   The total payment that has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   The payment amount that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Transaction Section

The data for the payment received in the overview section is derived from the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. In this section, users can enter details for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, including:
*   Date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Customer name (selectable from a list of all customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A document section to attach specific invoices related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

As transaction details are filled, the "payment amount received" figures in the summary and overview sections automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

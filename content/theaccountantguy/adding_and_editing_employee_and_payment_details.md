The Employee Paycheck Tracker is a straightforward template designed to help manage all employee payments in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This Notion template for employee payment tracking is structured into three main sections: Records, Payments, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Employee Records

The "Records" section holds comprehensive details about each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This includes whether they are permanent, the payments due to them, the number of months of payment outstanding, their payment basis (monthly or hourly), and the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It serves as a complete record of all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Employees

To add a new employee, click the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If you need to add a new category, click the "+" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Existing employee departments can be edited by clicking on them and modifying the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Payment and Summary Sections

The "Payment" section displays the total paycheck due, the amount already paid, the remaining balance due, and any advance payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The "Summary" section provides an overview, showing the total paycheck due, the amount paid, the outstanding balance, and the percentage of the total paycheck that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Feeding Payment Details

To enter specific payment details, scroll to the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Here, you can input:

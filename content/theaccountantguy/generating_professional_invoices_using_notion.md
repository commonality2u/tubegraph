This guide explains how to generate [[creating_professional_invoice_templates_in_notion | professional invoices]] in bulk as PDF documents using a Notion template and a Notion database, facilitated by PDF Output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Components: Notion Template and Database

To generate invoices, you need two main components within Notion:

1.  **Professional Invoice Template**
    *   This template defines the layout and content of your invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Elements intended to be replaced with data from your database are placed inside curly braces `{{}}` (e.g., `{{client name}}`, `{{client company}}`, `{{client address}}`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  **Notion Database for Invoices**
    *   This database stores all the information for your invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
    *   Each row in the database represents a single invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   The database properties (columns) should correspond to the elements defined in the template (e.g., "Client Name", "Client Company", "Client Address") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Utilizing PDF Output.com

The software used for this process is PDF Output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. After logging in, you will be directed to a "Connection Details" screen where you connect your Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Setup and Generation

1.  **Duplicate Templates to Notion Workspace**
    *   On PDF Output.com, navigate to the "Templates" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Search for "invoice" to find the professional invoices template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Click on both the database link and the template link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   In the newly opened tabs, click the "Duplicate" option (top right) to copy the template and database to your personal Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Select your desired Notion workspace when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

2.  **Connect Notion to PDF Output**
    *   Back on PDF Output.com, click "Add database" or "Add template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Select your Notion workspace and then choose the duplicated Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   Click "Allow access" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The database and template will automatically load in PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Define a connection name (e.g., "Invoice Template") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

3.  **Map Database Properties to Template Elements**
    *   PDF Output will display all database properties on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   If the names of your database properties exactly match the names in curly braces in your template, the elements will be automatically mapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   If names differ, an element will show a gray icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Click on it to manually search and select the corresponding database property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

4.  **Generate PDFs**
    *   Once all elements are correctly mapped, click "Create PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   PDF Output will generate a separate PDF document for every row in your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   After generation, you can preview a sample PDF or [[generating_pdf_invoices_from_notion_database | download all documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The generated PDFs will accurately reflect the data from your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Customization and Advanced Tips

*   **Template Customization**: The [[customizing_notion_invoice_templates | Notion Invoice Templates]] can be entirely customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Ensure that any dynamic data points you want to pull from the database are enclosed in curly braces with exact name matches to your Notion database properties for automatic mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Relational Properties**: If your invoice database uses relational properties linked to other Notion databases, ensure those linked databases are also added and connected in the PDF Output connection settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### PDF Output Features

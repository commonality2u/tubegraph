This article outlines the process of generating boarding pass PDF documents leveraging [[notion | Notion]] and a PDF output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_using_notion | generate PDF documents]] for boarding passes, two main components are required:

*   **[[creating_and_using_a_boarding_pass_database_in_notion | Boarding Pass Database]]**: A [[notion | Notion]] database containing all the necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **[[using_notion_templates_for_pdf_generation | Boarding Pass Template]]**: A [[notion | Notion]] template designed to format the boarding pass information into a PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Generation Process

The process of [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | generating the PDF documents]] involves connecting the database to a PDF output tool and selecting the appropriate template:

1.  **Connecting the Database**: The first step is to connect the [[creating_and_using_a_boarding_pass_database_in_notion | boarding pass database]] within the PDF output tool by typing its name in the connection details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  **Selecting the Template**: Next, the [[using_a_template_to_generate_pdf_documents_in_notion | boarding pass template]] must be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Loading Information**: After selecting the template, the system begins loading all the information from both the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
4.  **Exporting Documents**: Once the information is loaded, the user can initiate the export process to start [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdf_output | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Outcome

Upon successful export, the PDF documents are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Users can preview a sample to confirm that the [[creating_pdf_documents_from_a_notion_database | boarding pass]] has been generated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and extracted, showcasing individual PDF outputs for different boarding passes, each with unique names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This method allows for efficient [[generating_payment_receipts_pdf_using_notion | PDF generation]] using [[notion | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

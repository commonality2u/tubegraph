The employee training expenses tracker features a training dashboard that provides two views: a training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows for comprehensive [[tracking_employee_training_expenses_in_notion | tracking of employee training expenses]] and attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Training Overview
The training overview provides a summary of all scheduled trainings for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each individual training, the following details are displayed:
*   **Training Date** The date when employees are scheduled to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Employees Count** The total number of employees assigned to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Attendance** This metric shows the proportion of employees who have attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Training Expense** The cost incurred for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

All of this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Training Records Section
A dedicated "training records" section is available to manage all training sessions attended by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

#### Adding Training Records
To add a new training record, use the "Add Training" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This automatically creates a new entry where you can input the necessary details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

#### Editing Training Details
Within the training records, you can:
*   **Set Training Date** Specify the date when the training is scheduled to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Feed in Training Details** Add specific information about the training content or purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Select Employees** Choose the employees who are supposed to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Employees can be selected from a list, and their records can also be edited or new employees added directly from this database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Choose Training Type** Select the specific training an employee was supposed to attend; this is also editable within the training database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Update Attendance** Use a checkbox to indicate whether employees have attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Marking this automatically updates the attendance percentage in the training overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Multiple employees can be tagged to a single training record, and updates automatically reflect their attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

#### Training Expenses Section
After adding training records, you can navigate to the training expenses section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Here, you can view and edit the expenses incurred for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Editing Expenses** Click the pencil icon to edit any expense information, and it will automatically update across the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. For example, changing Training Three's expense from $1,400 to $1,800 immediately updates the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Changing View** This view can be switched to a table view for quicker editing of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Currency Customization
All currencies within the tracker are customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. You can change the currency settings by editing the property in the table view and selecting the desired number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Currency symbols in the dashboard's top section are also editable within the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

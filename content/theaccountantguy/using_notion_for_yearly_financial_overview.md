Notion's monthly budget planner template, created by An Biswal (The Accountant Guy), provides dedicated views for understanding your financial performance over an entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This feature is part of a broader system designed for [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | personal finance management]] and [[notion_monthly_budget_planner_setup | budgeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accessing the Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

Within the [[notion_monthly_budget_planner_setup | monthly budget planner]] setup, there are several views to track finances, including a specific "Yearly Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To access detailed yearly information, you can click on the "year" column within your expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Information Provided in the Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

The "Yearly Overview" displays comprehensive financial data presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. When you click on the year, a new window opens, showing:
*   The total budgeted amount for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   The total expenses amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Expenses as a percentage of the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   A status indicating whether you are under or have exceeded your annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   A consolidated list of all transactions for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   For each transaction, the amount and whether it was an actual expense or a budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Summary Section for Yearly Overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

In addition to the dedicated "Yearly Overview," a "Summary section" provides a complete expense outlook in a year format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This section groups all expenses together to offer a high-level overview of your annual financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Data Entry and Impact on Yearly Views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

All yearly financial data is automatically updated based on entries made in the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. As you continuously add expense information, all top-level figures, including those in the yearly views, are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This allows you to track your overall financial situation as it progresses throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Benefits of the Yearly Overview

The yearly overview allows for a comprehensive understanding of your finances, enabling you to:
*   Monitor annual spending against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Identify long-term spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Assess overall financial health over a longer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The template also allows for customization to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For further assistance, you can contact the creator at notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

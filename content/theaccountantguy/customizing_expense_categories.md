The Notion template for tracking business expenses, such as those for a restaurant operation, allows for flexible [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | customizing]] of [[setting_expense_categories | expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This ensures the tracker meets specific business requirements.

## Modifying Existing Categories

To modify an existing [[setting_and_modifying_expense_categories | category]] displayed at the top of the template:
*   Click on the pencil icon next to the [[setting_expense_categories | category]] name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Make the desired changes to the [[setting_and_modifying_expense_categories | category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The template will automatically update to reflect the modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Adding New Categories

To add a new [[setting_expense_categories | expense category]]:
*   Click on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   This will allow you to define and add the new [[setting_expense_categories | category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Deleting Categories

If a [[setting_expense_categories | category]] is no longer needed:
*   Click on the three-dot menu associated with that [[setting_expense_categories | category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Select the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The [[setting_expense_categories | category]] will be removed from the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Dynamic Updates

Any changes made to the [[setting_expense_categories | categories]], including modifications, additions, or deletions, will cause all related expense values in the template to update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This ensures that the summary section, which includes total [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | budgeted expense]], actual expenses, and the difference, remains accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Customizing Budgeted Expenses
In addition to [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | customizing]] [[setting_expense_categories | categories]], users can also define the [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | budgeted expense]] for each [[setting_expense_categories | category]] by clicking on its value and inputting the required budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A percentage indicator shows the actual expenses incurred compared to the [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

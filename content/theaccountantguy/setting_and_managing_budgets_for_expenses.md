This article outlines how to utilize a monthly budget planner, specifically a Notion-based template developed by "The Accountant Guy", for [[creating_and_monitoring_budgets | creating and monitoring budgets]] for monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The system allows users to budget for each month and track their spending against those budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Planner

The planner provides four primary views for managing and analyzing expenses:
*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Summary of all expenses** booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Key Components of Expense Tracking
In the expenses overview, expenses are initially categorized (e.g., shopping, entertainment, food, utilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each expense category, the system displays:
*   The total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   The budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   The percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if spending is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

The monthly and yearly overviews present the same information organized by month and year, respectively, providing a quick glance at expense performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The summary section offers a complete expense outlook in a yearly format, cluing all expenses together for an overall performance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[adding_and_managing_expenses | Adding and Managing Expenses]]

All expense information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database is sorted by month in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Entering Expense Details
To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click on "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date of the expense (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The system will automatically categorize it by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Type in the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the **Period** (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the **Year** (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Select the **Category** of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The system includes default categories like utilities, food, shopping, and entertainment, but users can add their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This contributes to [[setting_and_managing_expense_categories_in_notion | setting and managing expense categories]] for clear financial organization.
7.  Input an **Expense Code** to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the **Expense Amount** in the designated column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The expense details database includes two crucial columns: "Expense Amount" and "Budget Amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   The **Budget Amount** column is used at the start of the month to set a budget for a specific expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   The **Expense Amount** column is used to record actual expenses as they are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Process for Setting a Budget
To set a budget for a specific expense at the start of the month:
1.  Select the date (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the **Period** (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Select the **Category** (e.g., "food category expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   **Note**: For budget entries, the expense name and the category name should be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
6.  Set the Expense Code using the category and month (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  Enter the budgeted amount in the **Budget Amount** column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once entered, the system automatically updates all figures in the top views for the respective months and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This allows for [[setting_budget_goals_and_tracking_progress | setting budget goals and tracking progress]] as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | Tracking Budgeted and Actual Expenses]] and Analysis

As expense information is continuously added, all high-level views (Expenses Overview, Monthly Overview, Yearly Overview, Summary) are automatically updated, providing more information on monthly progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Users can click on different data points to access deeper insights:
*   **Period**: Clicking on a period (e.g., "Feb 2024") will open a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including the amount and whether it was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This offers a quick glance at the financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Year**: Clicking on the year provides a similar view, showing the budgeted amount, expense amount, expense as a percentage, and budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category**: Clicking on a category reveals how much expense has been booked for that specific category, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status, along with related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Expense Code**: Users can view the amount booked for a particular category of expense within a specific month compared to its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This system allows for detailed [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]] and analysis of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

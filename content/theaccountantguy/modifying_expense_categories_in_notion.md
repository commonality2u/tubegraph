This article details how to manage expense categories within a Notion template designed for tracking restaurant operation business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Expense Categories Overview

The template displays three different categories of expenses at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, there is a budgeted expense and the actual expenses, which are pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A percentage indicator shows the proportion of actual expenses incurred compared to the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The budgeted expense for any category can be defined or redefined by clicking on its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

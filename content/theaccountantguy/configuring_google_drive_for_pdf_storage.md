When using PDFoutput.com to [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_google_docs_and_notion | generate PDF documents in bulk]], you can configure Google Drive as the storage location for the generated files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This allows for centralized management and access to your exported PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Selecting Google Drive as Output Location

After setting up your document template and data source (e.g., Notion database), you need to specify where the generated PDFs will be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

1.  Within the PDFoutput.com interface, select "Google Drive" from the output destination options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
2.  Alternatively, you could choose the "downloads folder" to save files directly to your desktop's download directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## Creating a Dedicated Google Drive Folder

To keep your generated documents organized, it is recommended to create a specific folder in your Google Drive for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

1.  Navigate to your Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
2.  Click on "New" and then "New folder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
3.  Give your folder a descriptive name, such as "invitation documents" or "invitation docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
4.  Click "Create" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Connecting the Google Drive Folder to PDFoutput.com

Once your drive folder is created, you need to link it with PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

1.  Back in PDFoutput.com, click on "add folder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
2.  Select the newly created folder from the list that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This defines the output folder for your generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Exporting to Google Drive

After all settings are configured, including the Google Drive output folder, you can initiate the PDF generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

1.  Click on "Export PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
2.  The tool will begin generating documents and saving them directly to your specified Google Drive folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
3.  You can monitor the "PDF generated count" as documents are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
4.  Once completed, you can click "view in Google drive" to directly open the folder containing your newly generated PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

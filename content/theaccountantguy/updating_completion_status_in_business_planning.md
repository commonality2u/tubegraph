The business plan template allows users to track and update the completion status of their business planning progress across various [[stages_of_business_planning | stages]] and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Business Plan Road Map View

The business plan road map view displays the overall progress of each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This is represented by a completion percentage, which is updated automatically as individual tasks are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Task-Level Completion

Within each business plan stage, specific tasks are defined, each with its own tracking mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:

*   **Completion Checkbox**
    Each task includes a checkbox that indicates whether the task has been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Clicking this checkbox is the primary way to update a task's completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Status Assignment**
    After clicking the completion checkbox, users can assign a specific status to the task based on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Automatic Completion Percentage Update

When a task's completion checkbox is marked, the completion percentage for its corresponding business plan stage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Example:

If a stage has two tasks:
*   Completing one task will update the stage's progress to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Completing both tasks will show the stage as 100% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

This automatic update provides a quick overview of the progress at the stage level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] View

The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] view also reflects the status of tasks and stages in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This view displays the stage name, associated tasks, deadlines, and their respective statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

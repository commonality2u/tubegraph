The personal finance tracker includes a dedicated tab for [[dashboard_and_summary_overview_of_sinking_funds | sinking fund analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This section allows users to track contributions made to various [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking funds]] and monitor the remaining contributions needed for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The approach to [[sinking_funds_analysis | sinking funds analysis]] is similar to the [[budgeting_and_savings_strategy | monthly budget]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Key Information and Tracking
To utilize the [[sinking_funds_analysis | sinking funds analysis]], users must specify the following information:
*   **Fund Creation**: Define all the [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking funds]] to be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: Set a target goal amount for each [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Monthly Contribution**: Specify the desired monthly contribution for each [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Starting Amount**: Input any initial amount already saved for a specific [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

For example, a "home renovation" [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking fund]] might have a goal of $5,000, a monthly contribution of $400, and an initial fund of $2,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Analysis and Progress Monitoring
Based on the entries made, the tracker provides a comprehensive [[sinking_funds_analysis | analysis]]:
*   **Amount Saved**: Displays the total amount saved so far, which is calculated from the entries made in the tracking section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Amount Left**: Shows how much more needs to be saved to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Total Progress**: Calculates the progress percentage by dividing total savings by the set goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Estimated Completion**: Provides an estimated completion date and the number of months remaining to reach the goal, assuming consistent monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This [[sinking_funds_analysis | analysis]] is available for all [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

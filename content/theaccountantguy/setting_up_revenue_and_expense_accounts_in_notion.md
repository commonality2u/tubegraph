This guide explains how to [[setting_up_customer_and_vendor_accounts_in_notion | set up accounts]] within a Notion template to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | track]] tax payments, focusing on revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The [[setting_up_a_small_business_bookkeeping_template_in_notion | template]] provides a quarterly tax payment section for an at-a-glance view of tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary: Accounts Section

At the top of the Notion [[setting_up_a_small_business_bookkeeping_template_in_notion | template]], you'll find a "Tax Payment Summary" which includes an "Accounts" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This is where you establish all your revenue and [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense]] sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Revenue Sources
Revenue sources are categories where you incur tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples provided include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Expense Sources
[[using_notion_for_expense_management | Expense]] sources are categories where you can avail input tax credit to offset tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example provided is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Adding New Revenue or Expense Sources

To add a new revenue or [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense]] source:
1.  Utilize the "quick action button" on the left side of the "Accounts" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  Clicking "Add Revenue Source" will automatically add a new revenue [[setting_up_customer_and_vendor_accounts_in_notion | account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
3.  Clicking "Add Expense Source" will automatically add a new [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense]] [[setting_up_customer_and_vendor_accounts_in_notion | account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
4.  Use the pencil icon to input details for the new [[setting_up_customer_and_vendor_accounts_in_notion | account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The number of revenue and [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense]] sources you've added is automatically updated in the "Accounts" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Impact on Financials and Quarterly Taxes

Once revenue and [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense]] sources are established, and [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] are recorded:
*   The "Financials" section will display the total revenue and [[setting_and_updating_budgeted_and_actual_expenses_in_Notion | expense]] amounts, along with corresponding tax liabilities and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   The "Quarterly Taxes" section will reflect all tax payments due for each quarter, including taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   All data on the summary sections at the top of the [[setting_up_a_small_business_bookkeeping_template_in_notion | template]] automatically updates as you feed details into the [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] view at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   The template also includes a "Profit Loss" section, which displays total revenue, [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expenses]], and overall profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This setup allows for a comprehensive overview and [[how_to_build_an_expense_tracker_in_notion | tracking]] of your tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

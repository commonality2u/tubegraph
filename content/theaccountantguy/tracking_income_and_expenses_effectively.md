This article outlines how to effectively manage personal finances using a dedicated Notion-based tracker. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial health, from daily transactions to long-term goals like net worth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

The Notion tracker features several key sections for managing personal finances:
*   **Net Worth Target** Allows setting an annual net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Accounts** Specifies different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Summary** Provides an at-a-glance view of all finances, including contributions of each account to income, expenses, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Debt Section** Tracks upcoming and past debt payments, including next due dates, total debt, and debt paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Budget Section** Enables setting budgets for estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Savings Section** Helps track personal savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Bill Section** Shows upcoming and past bill payments, which can be modified as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Subscription Section** Functions similarly to the debt and bills sections, showing subscription status and payment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Section** Offers a total overview of achieved net worth and how far behind the target you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** Where all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions are fed, impacting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

    *   Total Net Worth (Assets - Liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
    *   The difference between your goal and current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
    *   The percentage of the net worth goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
    *   Total growth (Closing Net Worth - Opening Net Worth), where opening net worth is derived from opening balances in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

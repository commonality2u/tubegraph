Keeping track of restaurant operation [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | business expenses]] can be efficiently managed using a [[business_expense_tracking_with_notion | Notion template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template provides a centralized system for monitoring various expenditures.

## Overview of the Notion Template

The Notion template for restaurant expenses features three distinct categories of expenses listed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, there is a [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budgeted expense]] and a record of actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The actual expense figures are automatically pulled from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Key Features

### Expense Categories
The template allows for flexible management of expense categories:
*   **Modification**: Existing categories can be modified by clicking on a pencil icon, with updates applied automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Addition**: New categories can be added by clicking a "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Deletion**: Categories can be deleted using a three-dot menu option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Budgeting and Actuals
*   **Defining Budgets**: Users can define new [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budgeted expense]] values by simply clicking on the existing value in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Performance Indicator**: A percentage indicator shows the proportion of actual expenses incurred in comparison to the [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates
All expense values within the template update dynamically as figures are inputted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures that the displayed information is always current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Summary Section

*   The total [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This article details how to effectively [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | track restaurant operation business expenses]] using a specific template, designed to provide a quick and easy way to monitor financial outgoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template features three distinct categories of expenses displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, there is:
*   A budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Actual expenses, which are dynamically pulled from a table at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   A percentage indicator showing the proportion of actual expenses incurred relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Managing Expenses and Categories

The template allows for flexible management of financial data:
*   **Defining Budgeted Expenses:** To set a new budget for any category, simply click on its value and input the required amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Modifying Categories:** Existing categories can be modified by clicking on the pencil icon next to them, which will automatically update the category throughout the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** A new category can be introduced by clicking on the "new page" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories:** To remove a category, click on the three-dot icon associated with it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates and Summary

All expense values in the template update dynamically as figures are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures that the information presented is always current.

A summary section provides a comprehensive financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, including:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Total actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The overall percentage of actual expenses incurred to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

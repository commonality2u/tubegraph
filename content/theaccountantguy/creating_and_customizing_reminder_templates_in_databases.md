This article demonstrates how to set up and customize subscription payment reminders, delivered directly to WhatsApp, using a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Setting Up a Subscription Reminder Template

The process involves configuring reminders through a database to receive messages on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

1.  **Create a New Template**: Click on the database's drop-down menu and select the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This option is typically labeled "subscription reminder alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Input Subscription Details**:
    *   Specify the name of the subscription (e.g., "Spotify") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Enter the subscription amount (e.g., "$150") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    *   After inputting details, click "Done" or "Background" to add the new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Once the template is created, the next step is to configure its repetition schedule. This process is part of [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | automating bill payment reminders using templates]] and [[connecting_notion_templates_with_a_database_for_automation | connecting Notion templates with a database for automation]].

1.  **Set Repetition Mode**:
    *   Click on the three dots next to the newly added template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Select "repeat" and choose the desired frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This ensures the subscription reminder repeats monthly for the specified amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Specify Time and Date**:
    *   A new window will open, allowing you to set the exact time and date for the reminder to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   For example, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" to confirm the repetition settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A repetition arrow will appear, indicating the reminder is set to automatically repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Receiving Automated WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set, the system will automatically add a new line item to the database at the scheduled time and then send a notification to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Notification Content**: The WhatsApp notification includes a payment reminder for the specified amount (e.g., "$150 for Spotify subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Direct Payment Link**: The message also contains a "pay now" link, allowing direct payment through the provided URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is fully customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There is no fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Instructions and guidance on how to set up this automation are provided when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This process enables users to ensure timely payment of subscription amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

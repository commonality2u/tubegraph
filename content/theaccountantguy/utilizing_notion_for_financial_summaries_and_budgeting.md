Notion can be utilized to set up a small business bookkeeping template for tracking financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This template helps manage and summarize all business transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Template Structure
The Notion bookkeeping template is divided into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
1.  **Start Here** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>: Located at the top, this section is for entering initial business information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>: This section provides a summary of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, automatically updating based on transaction entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
3.  **Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>: Here, all transaction details related to the business are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts
The "Start Here" section includes an account section where various financial categories are set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Categories**: Accounts are organized under heads such as expenses, liabilities, income, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   *Examples*: Under expenses, there are purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, and salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

*   **Editing/Adding Accounts**: Existing items can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> or deleted via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. New items can be added by clicking "new page" under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This process will automatically update all summary sections, providing an overall view of business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

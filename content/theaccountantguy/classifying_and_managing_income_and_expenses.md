## Setting Up Accounts for Income and Expenses

To begin [[tracking_income_expenses_and_cash_flow_movements | tracking income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Here, you'll find accounts for both income (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Adding or Modifying Accounts
*   To add a new income or expense, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   To modify an existing account, click the "Edit" button next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   When creating a new account, enter its name and, for expenses, you can classify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Classifying Expenses
Expenses can be [[categorizing_expenses_as_needs_desires_and_wants | categorized]] for better organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Examples of classifications include:
*   **Bills**: For regular payments like groceries or utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Subscriptions**: For services like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

### Setting Payment Frequency
Specify how often an expense is expected to be paid, such as monthly or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This helps in [[classifying_travel_expenses_into_categories | classifying travel expenses into categories]] for example. Income accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Entering Income and Expense Transactions

After setting up accounts, navigate to the "Transactions" view to record entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The transaction section offers five different views: "All" (for all transaction types), "Income", "Expenses", "Assets", and "Liabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Recording Income Transactions
1.  Go to the "Income" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
3.  Select the **date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  Add a **description** (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
5.  The **category** will automatically be "Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
6.  Select the relevant **account** (e.g., "Salary") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
7.  Choose the **payment mode** (e.g., "Bank" or "Cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
8.  For income, the **transaction type** is "Inflow" as money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
9.  Specify the **amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Recording Expense Transactions
The process for expenses is similar to income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The main difference is the **transaction type**: for expenses, select "Outflow" as money is leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses in the Summary View

Once transactions are entered, you can track them in the "Summary" view under the "Finances" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   This view displays all account classifications under four main heads: Income, Expenses, Assets, and Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   For income, it shows the total amount earned and the percentage contribution of each income source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Similarly, for expenses, it shows the total expenses and the percentage bifurcation of each expense head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Any changes to transaction amounts automatically update the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

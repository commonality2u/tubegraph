## Automated Calculations and Real-time Updates

Upon entering the required data, the dashboard automatically updates various metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The price and associated graph update in real-time as trading happens in the stock market, eliminating the need for manual adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The dashboard provides a quick representation and analysis of:
*   **Market Value:** The current value of the held symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Cost and Market Value Analysis:** A comparison of the investment's cost versus its current market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The performance growth of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Value:** The total current value of the entire investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Gain (Absolute and Percentage):** The total profit or loss from the portfolio, both in monetary value and as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Dividend Income:** Any income received from dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Total Holdings:** An overview of all investments held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

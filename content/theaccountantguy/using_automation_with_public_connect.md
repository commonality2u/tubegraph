[[using_p_connect_for_workflow_automation | P Connect]] is an automation tool that can be used to set up automated workflows, such as recurring bill payment reminders sent via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation workflow is configured within [[using_p_connect_for_workflow_automation | P Connect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Purpose

The primary use demonstrated is to send automatic WhatsApp notifications for recurring bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Once a bill payment reminder template is set to recur monthly, notifications are automatically sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Setup and Functionality

The process involves:
*   Creating a new bill template, such as a "Mobile bill," and specifying the amount (e.g., $1500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Setting the bill to repeat on a recurring basis, like "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Specifying the exact time and day for the notification to be received (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Once this setup is saved, [[using_p_connect_for_workflow_automation | P Connect]] ensures that a notification is sent automatically to WhatsApp at the specified time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

A detailed explanation and guide for setting up this automation in [[using_p_connect_for_workflow_automation | P Connect]] is typically included when downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Notifications are generally sent within a minute of the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Quick Actions for Investment Management

The [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | Investment Portfolio tracker]] includes quick action buttons to streamline the process of managing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These buttons facilitate common tasks such as [[adding_and_editing_investments_in_notion | adding investments]] and recording transactions.

### Adding Investments

A dedicated "Add Investment" quick action button is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking this button immediately adds a new investment entry to the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

After adding, you can click on a pencil icon to open a new panel where you can input investment details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:
*   **Name** You can type in a name for the investment, e.g., "X investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance** Enter the initial financial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Opening Units** Specify the initial number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Classification** Initially, new investments are unclassified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. You can move them into existing [[creating_investment_categories_in_notion | categories]] like "Stocks" or "Cryptos" by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

You can also create new investment [[creating_investment_categories_in_notion | categories]] directly from this panel by clicking the plus icon and typing in a new group name, such as "Bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Recording Transactions

The tracker also provides quick action buttons for recording specific transaction types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>:

*   **Buy Investment** Clicking this button automatically adds a new line item under the "Buy" view in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It pre-fills the current date, which can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment** Similarly, clicking this button creates a new line item under the "Sell" view in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

These quick actions allow for efficient [[tracking_savings_and_investment_accounts | tracking of investments]] and their associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

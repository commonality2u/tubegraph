A dedicated [[tracking_hotel_bookings_in_notion | Notion template]] is available to help users [[tracking_hotel_bookings_in_notion | track hotel bookings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template provides a structured way to manage reservations and gather key information at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Template Overview and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The template features two main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   **Bookings by Room Type**: Shows the number of bookings made for different room types, with the number of guests displayed under each room type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**: Indicates how many guests have requested free pickup services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Booking Details Table

A simple table at the bottom of the template allows for the entry of specific guest and booking details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Columns include:
*   Guest Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Contact Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Special Request (placeholder text can be customized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Arrival Date (can include time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Departure Date (can include time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Room Type (allows selection from predefined types or creation of new ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Guest Count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Free Pickup (Yes/No option) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

## Customizing the Template

The [[customizing_notion_templates | Notion template]] offers several options for [[customizing_notion_templates | customizing Notion templates]] to suit specific needs:

### Date and Time Fields
*   The arrival date can be modified to include a specific arrival time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Similarly, the departure date can also include a specific departure time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Room Types
*   Users can select from pre-defined room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   New room types can be easily added by typing them in, which automatically creates a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The icon associated with any room type can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Changes made to room types in the table automatically update the KPIs at the top of the template, ensuring two-way synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This demonstrates how to manage [[using_notion_to_manage_room_types_and_guest_preferences | room types and guest preferences]] effectively.

### Advanced Customization
*   While the guest count is tracked in the table, it is not displayed in the top KPIs by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Incorporating this would require further [[personalizing_templates_with_notion_data | personalization of templates with Notion data]] and specific [[customizing_notion_templates | template customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   The template is entirely customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For specific customization needs, users can reach out to the provider via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

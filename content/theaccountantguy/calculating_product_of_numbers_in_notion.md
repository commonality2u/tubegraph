In Notion, you can [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a database using [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A database can be set up to contain the numbers and then calculate their product using two distinct methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Database Setup

To perform product calculations, a database should include:
*   A "name of the operator" property, typically a title property, to identify the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two number properties, each assigned a number value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Formula Methods

Two main methods can be used to [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion | calculate the product]]:

### 1. The "Multiply Operator" Formula

This method uses a dedicated "multiply operator formula" where the two numbers are provided as inputs to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, if "2" and "3" are input numbers, the formula will yield "6" as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

Another [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion | formula]] involves simply placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

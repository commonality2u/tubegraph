This article details how to calculate the product of two numbers within a database in Notion using two different [[formulas in Notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Database Setup

A database for this purpose typically consists of three main properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
*   **Operator Name:** A title property, which for this operation would be "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Number Properties:** Two separate number properties, each assigned to one of the numbers intended for multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Product Calculation:** A formula property that calculates the product of the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Methods for Calculation

The product of two numbers can be calculated using two distinct [[formulas in Notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:

### 1. Using the `multiply()` operator formula
This method involves providing the two numbers as input to a dedicated `multiply()` operator formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, if numbers 2 and 3 are provided, the formula using the [[using multiply operator in Notion | multiply operator]] will yield 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the multiply symbol (`*`)
Another approach is to simply place the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two number properties in the [[formulas in Notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This directly [[applying formula for multiplication in Notion | multiplies]] the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both methods allow for the calculation of the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The Investment Portfolio tracker provides a structured way to organize investments by classifying them into various categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This categorization helps in managing and reviewing different types of holdings efficiently.

## Default and Custom Categories

Upon starting the tracker, the investment section is pre-divided into "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Users can also add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For example, two stocks and one crypto are pre-added for demonstration purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

In the portfolio section, these investments are classified under "stocks," "cryptos," and any other groups the user adds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Managing Categories

### Adding a New Category
To add a new category or group for investments:
1.  Click the "plus icon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
2.  A prompt will appear to "create a new group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
3.  Type in the desired category name, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
4.  Once added, a new section will automatically appear for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Assigning an Investment to a Category
When adding a new investment using the "add investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, or by editing an existing one:
1.  A new panel opens to add or edit investment details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
2.  Initially, newly added investments might be listed under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
3.  To categorize it, click on the "three dots" next to the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
4.  Drag and move it to the desired category, such as "stocks" or "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The investment will then be automatically placed under that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Editing Existing Categories
To edit an already added category or investment item:
1.  Click on the item or category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Type in the desired new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
3.  Click "done" to modify the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

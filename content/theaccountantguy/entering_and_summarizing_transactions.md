A business expense tracker helps keep track of all business expenses under one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tool is designed to facilitate both the [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | adding of transactions and expenses]] and their subsequent [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary and reporting]] against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To begin [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | entering transactions]], navigate to the [[using_a_transactions_tab_for_finance | transaction side]] of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Here, you can input the details of your business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The process for [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | adding new transactions]] involves several steps:
*   **Select Date** Click to choose the date of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The selected date will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Add Description** Input a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Select Account** Choose from predefined accounts or add new ones as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Enter Amount** Specify the monetary amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summarizing Transactions

Once transactions are entered, the system provides a [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary]] on the left side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary]] displays key financial metrics for effective [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | tracking transactions]] and [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | expense management]]:
*   Budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

This [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary]] helps in quickly assessing financial performance against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.# Entering and Summarizing Transactions

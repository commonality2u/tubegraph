A Notion expenses tracker can be utilized to manage all expenses in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template allows users to set, update, and track both budgeted and actual expenses for various categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Expense Tracker Overview

The tracker features a category section at the top, which can be defined according to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Each category displays a budgeted expense amount and an actual expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Managing Categories
Categories can be renamed by hovering over them, clicking the pencil icon, typing the new name, and pressing enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. To edit or delete existing categories, click the three dots next to the category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. New categories can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Expenses
To set your own budgeted expense for a category, click on the budgeted expense amount within that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Figures can be changed as needed, and the total budget will update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For example, a total budget could be set to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Tracking Actual Expenses
Below the categories, a table lists individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As amounts are entered into this section, all corresponding categories are automatically updated with the respective actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This functionality supports [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | tracking expenses with Notion]] and [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Summary Section
The summary section provides an overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses amount, which is computed from the expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

When budgeted figures are updated in the categories, the summary section automatically reflects these changes and updates all respective figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

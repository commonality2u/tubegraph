Notion templates offer a flexible way to manage various aspects of a business, including tracking expenses for projects like construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A typical [[customizing_notion_templates_for_expense_management | Notion template for expense management]] defines different categories of expenses at the top, along with budgeted and actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Template Overview for Expense Tracking

In an expense tracking template, actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Values in this table can be modified, allowing expenses to update dynamically based on changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, changing values in the expense table will reflect corresponding updates in the category totals at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Customizing Expense Data

Users can update the expense data directly within the template.
*   **Modifying Values**: Users can change values in the expense table at the bottom, and these updates will dynamically reflect in the overall expense tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Managing Categories

The template allows for extensive customization of expense categories:
*   **Editing Categories**: To edit an existing category, click on the pencil icon associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This allows users to define new categories tailored to their specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: To remove a category, click on the three-dot menu next to it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Modifying Budgeted Expenses

The budgeted expense amount for any category can be easily adjusted by clicking on the current budgeted figure and entering a new amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template includes a summary section that provides an overview of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Actual expenses pulled from the bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This provides a quick and easy way to keep track of project expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

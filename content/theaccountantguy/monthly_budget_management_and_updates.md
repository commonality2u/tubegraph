This budgeting tracker template offers various options to fulfill budgeting needs, providing an [[overview_of_budgeting_tracker_template | overview]] of financial components and allowing for dynamic updates and comprehensive management of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Core Components of the Budgeting Tracker

The tracker is structured around five main financial components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For each component, a targeted or budgeted amount can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. For income, this is referred to as the "goal amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, while for expenses, it's the "budget amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Automatic Updates and Budget Status

As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It also displays the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
A "budget status" shows whether spending has remained within the budgeted amount or gone beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies uniformly across all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Managing Budget and Expenditure Overview

The left side of the tracker provides an [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | overview]] of all elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A dropdown menu allows selection between components like income, expense, debt, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

For instance, selecting the income [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | overview]] displays all added income categories, their specific income amounts, set goal amounts, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This data aggregates across different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Similarly, for expenses, it shows the targeted amount and incurred expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Users can add as many categories as needed for each component, and the tracker will [[dynamic_updates_of_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | automatically update]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

Inputs for transactions are entered via quick buttons located in a dedicated section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Each button, such as "income," "expense," "debt," "bills," or "savings," serves a specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Clicking an "income" button, for example, automatically adds an income entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For each transaction, users need to provide details such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   **Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Month** (can be custom-typed, e.g., "Jan 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   **Category** (e.g., "salary," "side income," "food," "entertainment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   **Code** (used to collate data for different months or specific sources, e.g., "Side ASL Income for Jan 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   **Budget Amount** (set at the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Actual Amount** (entered as the month progresses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

The currency can also be changed from dollars to any other preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Monthly Overview and Dynamic Updates

The tracker provides a month-wise summary, mirroring the top-level overview but with monthly divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For example, in the expense summary, categories like "food," "entertainment," and "shopping" are broken down by month (e.g., "Jan 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When new entries for different months are added, the data [[dynamic_updates_of_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | automatically updates]] and is reflected in the monthly summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

This [[budget_summary_and_tracking | summary]] helps users understand their budgeting performance, indicating the percentage of the budget incurred and whether they are "under budget" or "over budget" for specific categories and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The entire dataset can be filtered dynamically by year or month to view specific periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Funds Balance and Financial Tracking

An important feature is the "funds balance" view, which provides a [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | summary]] of income versus spending for each month, showing the remaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Income is tracked separately from spending, which includes expenses, debt payments, bills payments, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This feature offers a quick glance at the financial position at the end of every month and can also be filtered dynamically by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

This comprehensive [[setting_and_managing_a_monthly_budget | budgeting tracker]] aims to solve various budgeting requirements, including [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | debt payments]] and providing a [[paycheck_budget_tracker_overview | detailed overview]] of financial flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

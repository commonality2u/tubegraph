A Notion template is available for [[managing_business_expenses_in_notion | tracking business expenses]] related to construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This template allows for [[using_notion_for_expense_tracking | dynamic updating of expenses]] as values are modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## How Dynamic Updates Work

The template displays different categories of expenses at the top, each showing a budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The "actual expenses" figures are automatically populated from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Users can [[using_notion_to_edit_and_update_expense_details | modify values]] in this bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When these values are changed, the expense figures displayed at the top update dynamically to correspond with their respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Managing Categories and Budgeted Expenses

The template provides flexibility in [[setting_up_income_and_expense_tracking_in_notion | setting up expense categories]] and budgets:
*   **Editing Categories** To edit any existing category, users can click on a pencil icon associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This allows for defining new categories tailored to specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories** A new expense category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories** Categories can be removed by clicking on the three-dot icon next to the category and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Defining Budgeted Expenses** The budgeted expense amount for any category can be defined or updated by simply clicking on the amount itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template includes a summary section that offers an overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total budgeted expense that was initially defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The actual expenses, which are pulled from the detailed table at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This provides a quick and straightforward method to [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | keep track of construction project expenses]] within a single Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

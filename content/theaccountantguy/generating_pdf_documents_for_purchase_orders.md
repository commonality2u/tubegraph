This article explores how to utilize a purchase order tracker template and a dedicated online tool to [[generating_purchase_order_pdfs_in_bulk | generate PDF documents for purchase orders]], both individually and in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Utilizing a Purchase Order Tracker Template

A purchase order tracker template can be used to keep track of purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template includes a database designed for managing various aspects of purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Tracker Database Details

The database contains several key columns:
*   **Purchase Order Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Order Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Expected Delivery Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Terms and Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Company Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Company Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Supplier Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Description** (for items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Quantity** (for items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Unit Price** (for items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

The template includes two default description, quantity, and unit price fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Additional item descriptions can be added by duplicating existing columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The subtotal amount is automatically computed as a summation of the unit price and quantity for all descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To include more items in the subtotal calculation, the formula needs to be updated after duplicating columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Further financial details include:
*   **Shipping Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Tax Rate** (in percentage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   **Total Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   **Notes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

### Summary & Client Overview

At the top of the tracker, a purchase order summary provides an overview of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   **Total Purchases**: Obtained from the summation of all purchases in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units Ordered**: Calculated from the quantity columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Formulas for these summaries must be updated if more quantity columns are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Average Order Value**: Computed automatically by dividing total purchases by units ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

A client summary section tracks specific data for different clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. For example, for clients like ABC Solutions, XYZ Manufacturing, and LMN Enterprises, it shows:
*   **Total Purchases Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   **Total Quantities Ordered** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   **Average Order Value** for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

This template is designed to be quick and easy to use for tracking purchase order expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. For further customization, users can reach out to notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Generating PDFs with PDFOutput.com

To [[creating_and_exporting_pdf_documents_for_business | create and export PDF documents for business]], specifically for purchase orders, an online tool like PDFOutput.com can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Login and Template Selection

After logging into PDFOutput.com, users are presented with an interface to select a template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For purchase orders, the "Purchase AO template" should be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The desired currency can also be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Options are available to request new currencies or templates if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Single PDF Generation

In "Single PDF mode," users can generate individual purchase order PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This involves manually filling in the details (e.g., order date, expected delivery date, company information, item descriptions, quantities, unit prices) from the purchase order tracker database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Once all information is filled, the total amount is reflected on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Clicking "Download PDF" generates a clean and precise PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The currency can be changed, and the PDF will reflect the new currency instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Bulk PDF Generation

For [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | generating and downloading PDF documents in bulk]], the platform offers a "Bulk Export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In this mode, users can fill in details for multiple purchase orders by adding new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. After entering all the information, individual documents can be downloaded, or all documents can be downloaded simultaneously by clicking "Download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This feature is also relevant for [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | bulk PDF document generation]] beyond just purchase orders, including tasks like [[generating_pdf_documents_for_businesses | generating PDF documents for businesses]] or [[generating_sales_receipts_pdf_documents | generating sales receipts PDF documents]].

### Future Enhancements: Notion Integration

A future integration for PDFOutput.com will allow direct support for Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This means users will be able to select their Notion database directly within PDFOutput.com, automatically populate the information, and then generate PDFs with a single click, streamlining the process of [[generating_purchase_order_pdfs_using_notion | generating purchase order PDFs using Notion]] and other documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This will also simplify [[using_pdf_output_for_invoice_generation | using PDF output for invoice generation]] or [[generating_pdf_documents_from_invoices | generating PDF documents from invoices]] if similar templates are available.

This dual approach of using a structured tracker and an efficient PDF generation tool helps manage and formalize purchase orders effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

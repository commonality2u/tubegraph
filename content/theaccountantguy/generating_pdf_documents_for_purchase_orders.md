Generating PDF documents for purchase orders can be efficiently managed using online tools like PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This platform simplifies the process of [[creating_pdf_documents_for_business_needs | creating PDF documents for business needs]] by providing templates and customization options.

## Using PDF Output.com for Purchase Order PDFs

To generate purchase order PDFs, the first step is to log in to PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Choosing a Template and Currency

Upon logging in, users will encounter an interface where they can select a specific template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. For purchase orders, the "Purchase AO template" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Users can also select their desired currency from the interface, with the option to request new currencies if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Similarly, if a particular template is not available, it can be requested through the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Single PDF Generation

For generating individual purchase order PDFs:
1.  Ensure the "single PDF mode" is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
2.  Fill in all the necessary details, such as order date, expected delivery date, company information, supplier name, item descriptions, quantities, and unit prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This information can be directly copied from a purchase order tracker database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
3.  The system automatically computes subtotals, includes shipping costs, and applies tax rates to determine the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
4.  Click "Download PDF" to generate the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The generated PDF will reflect the chosen currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Bulk PDF Generation

For [[generating_purchase_order_pdfs_in_bulk_using_notion | generating purchase order PDFs in bulk]]:
1.  Switch to the "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
2.  Fill in the details for multiple purchase orders by adding new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, similar to how data is entered into a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
3.  Users can choose to "download individual documents" or "download all PDF" documents in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

### Future Integrations

An upcoming integration will allow for direct export of purchase order PDFs from a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This feature will streamline the process by enabling users to select a Notion database and generate PDFs by reading information directly from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. This will further enhance the ability to generate documents like [[generating_purchase_order_pdfs_with_notion | purchase order PDFs with Notion]].

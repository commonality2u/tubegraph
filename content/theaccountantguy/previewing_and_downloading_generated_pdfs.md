After successfully [[generating_single_and_bulk_pdf_documents|generating PDF documents]] within Notion using [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation|PDF output]], the system provides options to preview and download the created files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

## Previewing Generated PDFs

Once the export process is successful, a "Preview Sample" option becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Clicking this allows users to view the generated PDF, which includes all the details extracted from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. For example, a generated boarding pass PDF will display all relevant information pulled from the associated database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

## Downloading and Opening Documents

After reviewing the sample, users can proceed to download the generated files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. Once downloaded, the files can be opened, and if they are in a compressed format (like a ZIP archive), they may need to be extracted first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.

The generated PDF documents can then be opened individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. The system can generate multiple PDFs, each with different names and contexts, showcasing the ability to produce varied documents from a single process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. This demonstrates how [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation|PDF output]] facilitates [[generating_single_and_bulk_pdf_documents|generating PDF documents]] efficiently using Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

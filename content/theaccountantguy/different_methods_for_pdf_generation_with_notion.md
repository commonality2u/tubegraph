This article explores various methods for [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion | generating PDF documents from Notion]] data, primarily using the [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] tool. The process involves leveraging Notion databases as a data source and Notion pages as templates for PDF creation.

## Utilizing Notion for PDF Template Creation

[[using_notion_for_pdf_template_creation | Using Notion for PDF Template Creation]] involves designing a Notion page that serves as the blueprint for your PDF documents. Key fields from your Notion database are inserted into this template using specific placeholder syntax.

### Template Design
To create a template, specific fields from your Notion database (e.g., `Full Name`, `Date of Birth`, `Gender`, `Phone Number`) are placed inside curly brackets `{}` in the template page. These placeholders will be automatically populated with data from your database [00:00:54].

For example, a template might include:
*   Full Name: `{Full Name}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Date of Birth: `{Date of Birth}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Gender: `{Gender}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   Phone Number: `{Phone Number}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

The fields in the template must exactly match the column names in your Notion database [00:01:13].

### Setting Up a Notion Database and Template for PDF Generation

This method focuses on [[setting_up_a_notion_database_and_template_for_pdf_generation | setting up a Notion database and template for PDF generation]] where the template is integrated within each database entry.

1.  **Database Preparation**: Start with a Notion database containing the data you wish to use (e.g., an application form database tracking candidate profiles and education requirements) [00:00:06].
2.  **Populating Rows with the Template**: For each row in the database, open the page and paste the created template content into the empty section [00:01:31]. This ensures every page associated with a database row has the template content [00:02:15].
3.  **Automating Template Insertion**: To avoid manual copy-pasting for new entries, create a database template.
    *   Click the dropdown next to "New" in the database [00:02:26].
    *   Select "New Template" [00:02:31].
    *   Name the template (e.g., "Applicant Name") and paste the template content into it [00:02:37].
    *   Set this template as default for all views within the specific database (e.g., "Application Form Database") [00:02:50]. New data entries will now automatically include this template [00:03:01].

### Using PDFOutput for Bulk PDF Generation

[[using_notion_as_a_database_for_pdf_generation | Using Notion as a database for PDF generation]] with [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] allows for [[bulk_pdf_generation_from_notion_databases | bulk PDF generation from Notion databases]].

1.  **Connect Notion to PDFOutput**:
    *   Sign in to [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] [00:03:46].
    *   Copy the Notion database URL [00:04:17] and paste it into [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] [00:04:24].
    *   Generate a Notion API key by creating a new integration in Notion settings, copying the "internal integration secret" [00:04:43], and pasting it into [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] [00:05:05].
    *   Connect your Notion database to this API key by clicking the three dots on the database, selecting "Connections", and choosing your created API key [00:05:17].
    *   Publish your Notion database by clicking "Share" > "Publish" to make it accessible to [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] [00:05:41].

2.  **Generate PDFs**:
    *   In [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]], click "Load Database" [00:06:00].
    *   Select a column to use as the reference for naming the PDF files (e.g., "Full Name") [00:06:03].
    *   Choose to generate PDFs for all rows, a specific range, or custom rows [00:06:21].
    *   Click "Generate PDF" [00:06:33]. The tool will automatically populate the template with data from each row, generating a PDF document [00:06:47].
    *   Adjust settings like paper size and layout as needed [00:07:17].
    *   Save the generated PDF files [00:07:30].

The generated PDF filenames will correspond to the selected naming column, and the content will be dynamically pulled from the Notion database rows [00:08:02].

## Alternative Method: Using a Separate Notion Page as a Template

[[using_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_generation | Using Notion templates and databases for PDF generation]] can also be achieved by providing a separate template page URL to [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]], instead of embedding the template within each database row [00:10:29].

1.  **Provide Template URL**: Copy the URL of your dedicated Notion template page and paste it into the "Notion Page" section of [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] [00:10:36].
2.  **Load Page**: Click "Load Page" to load the template document [00:10:46].
3.  **Load Database**: Then, load your Notion database URL as described in the previous method [00:10:54].
4.  **Generate PDFs**: Proceed with selecting the naming column and generating the PDFs. The tool will use the external template page to combine with the database data [00:11:02].

## Versatile Applications

These methods enable [[exporting_notion_data_to_pdf | exporting Notion data to PDF]] for various purposes:
*   Generating invoices from an invoice database [00:08:57].
*   Creating application forms [00:00:12].
*   Producing any type of document for business or personal use [00:08:50].

It's important to note that while placeholder elements matching database fields are beneficial for dynamic population, it is not mandatory for every element in the template [00:09:22]. You can include any notes, lectures, or other information in the Notion page, and [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion_and_pdfoutput | PDFOutput]] will still generate a PDF of the entire content [00:09:18].

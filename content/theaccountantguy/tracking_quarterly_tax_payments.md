This article explains how to utilize a template designed to track all your tax payments, providing a comprehensive overview of tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes a dedicated [[notion_tax_payment_tracker | quarterly tax payment]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is structured with key sections to manage your tax obligations:

### Tax Payment Summary

At the top, a "Tax Payment Summary" displays three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

#### Accounts
This section is where you set up your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "Services" and "Goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These are where input tax credit is availed to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using a quick action button on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and then input details using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The summary automatically updates the count of revenue and expense sources as you add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

#### Financials
The "Financials" section allows you to track your total revenue and expense amounts, along with the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, services might show $2,000 in total revenues with a $200 tax payable, while purchases might have $10 in input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. All these figures update automatically once you feed details into the transactions view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

#### Quarterly Taxes
This part of the summary reflects all tax payments you need to make for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It breaks down into taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Figures are updated based on transactions booked for specific quarters, for example, reflecting updated figures in Quarter 3 if transactions are booked for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Transactions Section

Below the summary, the "Transaction" section is where you record detailed financial activities, classified into "Revenue" and "Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions
1.  Click "Add Revenue" to add a new line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The current date is automatically picked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  Select the **Period** (e.g., Quarter 3 for a September transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the relevant **Account** (e.g., "Goods") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the **Amount** (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Specify the **Tax Rate** (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The tax payable (e.g., $80) is automatically calculated and the total is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
6.  The summary sections at the top, including [[quarterly_financial_summaries | Quarterly Taxes]] and tax liability, will update instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
Similar to revenue, you can add an expense by clicking "Add Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
1.  Fill in the date, period (e.g., Quarter 3), account (e.g., "Purchases"), amount (e.g., $500), and tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  The input credit (e.g., $50) is calculated, and the total input credit (e.g., $60) gets reflected in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
3.  The overall tax liability (e.g., $220) will also update, although it might take a moment to reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also features a "Profit/Loss" section, which displays the total revenue earned from all transactions, total expenses booked, and the resulting total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This [[payments_tracker | tax payment tracker]] helps you understand and manage your tax payments effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

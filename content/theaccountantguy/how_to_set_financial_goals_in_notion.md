Sanat Biswal, also known as the Accountant Guy, provides Notion templates to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners [[finance_management_using_notion | manage their finances using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. One such template is a Net Worth Tracker, designed to help users [[utilizing_notion_to_monitor_net_worth_and_financial_goals | track their net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and set financial goals.

The Net Worth Tracker is structured into three main sections to enable effective net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

1.  **Get Started** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
2.  **Account Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
3.  **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

## Setting Your Net Worth Goal

The initial step in [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | setting financial goals]] with this Notion template is to specify your Net Worth Goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Net Worth Goal" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  Click on the displayed amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
4.  Edit the value to your desired net worth goal (e.g., $14,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   As soon as you add this value, the entire database automatically updates to reflect the new goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts

To calculate your personal finances and track progress towards your net worth goal, you need to specify all relevant accounts in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Accounts are classified into expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Adding a New Account

1.  Go to the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Scroll down to find the "New" button under the relevant category (Income, Expense, Asset, or Liability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
3.  Click "New" to open a pop-up window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
4.  **Enter Account Name**: Type the name of the new account (e.g., "Interest Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
5.  **Opening Balance**: For assets and liabilities, you can specify an opening balance, which is the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Income and expenses typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
6.  **Classification**: Tag your account with a relevant category (e.g., "Other Income" for interest income, "Crypto" for Bitcoin investment, "Savings" for a car fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add new categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
7.  **Payment Frequency**: For income and liabilities, specify how frequently payments are received or made (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can add custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
8.  **Opening Units (for Investments)**: For investments, specify the number of starting units (e.g., 10 units of Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
9.  **Asset Class (for Investments)**: For investments, classify the asset as "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This field can be left blank for other account types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Editing an Existing Account

To modify an already added account, click on the pencil icon next to the account name. This will open an edit window, allowing you to change values or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

The "Transactions" section is where you [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | record all financial activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It has four distinct views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Entering a Transaction

1.  Select the relevant view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
2.  Click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
3.  **Date**: Select the transaction date. The template automatically classifies transactions by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
4.  **Description**: Add a brief description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
5.  **Category**: This is pre-selected based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
6.  **Account**: Link the transaction to one of the accounts you created earlier (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
7.  **Payment Mode**: Specify how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
8.  **Transaction Type**: Determine if it's an "Inflow" (money coming in, like income or new loans) or "Outflow" (money going out, like expenses or loan repayments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
9.  **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
10. **Document**: Optionally, attach any receipts or bills by embedding a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Tracking and Analyzing Your Net Worth

After setting up accounts and recording transactions, the "Summary" section provides a comprehensive overview of your finances and calculates your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This enables you to [[analyzing_financial_data_using_notion | analyze financial data]] and track progress towards your goals.

### Finances Overview

This view shows the current standing of all your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including their specific amounts and their proportion to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Net Worth View

This crucial view presents five key statistical figures to help you [[utilizing_notion_to_monitor_net_worth_and_financial_goals | monitor your financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:

1.  **Net Worth Goal**: Displays the goal you set earlier (e.g., $14,000, which can be adjusted directly from here to see immediate updates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as your total assets minus your total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The difference between your Net Worth Goal and your Total Net Worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: The difference between your current closing net worth and your opening net worth (based on opening balances specified in the Account section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal you have accomplished, calculated as Total Net Worth divided by your Net Worth Goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The Net Worth Tracker automatically updates these figures as you add more transactions and deal with different financial items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

The Notion Net Worth Tracker offers flexibility:

*   **Currency Change**: You can change the currency from dollars to over 30 other currencies that Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Detailed instructions are available within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Layout Customization**: The dashboard's appearance can be changed (e.g., from Board view to Gallery view) to suit personal preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Device Compatibility**: The template supports all devices, including iOS, Mac, and various operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

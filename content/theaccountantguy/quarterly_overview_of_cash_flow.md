The "Quarterly Overview" section in the business cash flow template provides a summary of cash flow movement for each month, categorized into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This section is located on the right side of the main interface, alongside the account section and business activity overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Components of the Quarterly Overview

The overview is divided into four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. For each month within these quarters, specific amounts are displayed for:

*   **Inflow**: Designates the total cash that has entered the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Outflow**: Designates the total cash that has exited the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Net Balance**: The resulting balance after inflow and outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

This provides a quick summary of monthly cash flow, organized by quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Dynamic Updates

As you add new transactions, the figures in the quarterly overview automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, in Quarter 3 for August 2023, the template might show an inflow of $380, an outflow of $720, and a net balance of $2080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Within a tax payment tracking template, a dedicated "profit loss" section provides a summary of your financial performance by displaying total revenue, total expenses, and the resulting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This section helps in understanding your financial standing in relation to your tax obligations.

## Components of Profit and Loss

The calculation of profit and loss hinges on two primary categories:

*   **Revenue Sources**
    *   These are the sources from which tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   Examples include income from services or goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   The "financials" section of the template allows users to [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track]] all revenue amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   For instance, a service might generate $2,000 in total revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**
    *   These are areas where input tax credit can be availed to offset tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   An example is purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   The "financials" section also allows users to [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track]] all expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   For example, purchases might have an input tax of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts

Users can set up their revenue and expense sources within the "accounts" section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Quick action buttons allow for easy addition of new revenue or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, which then update the displayed count of active sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Calculating Profit

Profit is determined by subtracting total expenses from total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The template automatically updates these figures based on the transactions entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Transaction Entry

Transactions are classified as either revenue or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. When adding a transaction:
*   The current date is automatically picked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Users select the relevant quarter (e.g., September falls in Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   The appropriate revenue or expense account is chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   The amount is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   A tax rate is applied, which automatically calculates the tax payable or input credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

For example, entering a $1,000 revenue for goods with an 8% tax rate automatically shows $80 as tax payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Similarly, a $500 expense with a 10% tax rate yields $50 in input credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Connection to Tax Tracking

The [[calculating_and_understanding_profit_and_loss_in_an_investment_portfolio | profit and loss]] figures directly feed into the quarterly tax payment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This section displays:
*   **Taxes Payable:** The total tax liability incurred from revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Input Tax:** The total input tax credit available from expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Tax Liability:** The net tax due after setting off input tax against taxes payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

All updates from the transaction section are reflected in the quarterly tax summary, allowing for a comprehensive overview of tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

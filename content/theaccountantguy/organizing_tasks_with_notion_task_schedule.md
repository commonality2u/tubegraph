The [[notion_employee_schedule_template_setup|Notion employee schedule template]] can be used to track schedules for employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template offers four distinct views: Employee Details, Task Schedule, Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Task Schedule View

The Task Schedule section of the template is designed to organize and track specific tasks assigned to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Shift Management
Tasks are categorized into different shifts, including First, Second, and Third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Task Entry Details
Employees can enter detailed information for each task:
*   **Start Time:** Users can input the desired date and time for when a task begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **End Time:** Similar to the start time, users can specify the end date and time, indicating the period to which the task belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Task Detail:** This field allows for the entry of specific task-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Employee and Department Assignment
*   **Employee Selection:** When adding a task, users can select an employee from a pre-defined list that was set up in the "Employee Details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. New employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Department Auto-Population:** Once an employee is selected, their respective department is automatically displayed, based on the information set in the "Employee Details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Automated Computations
The template automatically computes the hours an employee has worked on a specific task based on the entered start and end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Attendance and Task Status
*   **Attendance Marking:** Employees can mark their attendance as "present," "on leave," or "day off" according to their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Task Status:** The status of a task can be updated to "in progress," "completed," or "not started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For instances where an employee has a day off or is on leave, the task status can be set to "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

This system allows employees to update their task information efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The [[notion_employee_schedule_template_setup|employee schedule template]] facilitates tracking employees and scheduling their work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The template is fully [[customizing_notion_templates_for_employee_scheduling|customizable]] to fit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

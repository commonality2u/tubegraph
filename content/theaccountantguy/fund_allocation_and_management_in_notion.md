A minimalistic budget planner can be created using Notion to [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | create and track budgets and savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This dashboard serves as a central location to [[finance_management_using_notion | keep track of income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, fix monthly income goals, categorize expenses, and monitor monthly budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The template is accessible from any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and can be obtained from the accountantguy.gumroad.com online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Dashboard Segments

The budget planner dashboard consists of three main segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

*   **Summary Segment** Provides an overall view of income, expenses, and allocation of funds, including quarterly allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Income Details** Shows actual versus estimated income, quarterly income overview, and frequency of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Expense Details** Presents actual versus budgeted expenses, quarterly expense overview, and types of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

To use this template, a Notion account is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Setting up the Budget Planner

The budget planner is set up in three simple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:

1.  **Filling out Income Details** Inputting income information for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  **Filling out Expense Details** Inputting individual expense information for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. [[using_notion_for_expense_management | Managing expenses in Notion]] is critical for fund allocation.
3.  **Allocating Available Funds** Distributing the remaining funds (income minus expenses) for each month into different allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Fund Allocation Details

The third step focuses on [[managing_asset_financials_in_notion | managing asset financials in Notion]] by allocating available funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

#### Calculating Available Funds
Available funds are calculated by subtracting total expenses from total income for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This is done using a formula property in Notion: `total income - total expenses` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

#### Allocating Funds to Different Heads
Once available funds are determined, they are allocated to different categories such as investment, savings, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

*   **Investment Section** Funds allocated for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This directly supports [[asset_performance_assessment_using_notion | asset performance assessment using Notion]].
*   **Savings Section** Funds allocated for savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. [[editing_and_managing_savings_in_notion | Editing and managing savings in Notion]] is a core function here.
*   **Others Section** Funds allocated to miscellaneous categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a> (which could include purposes like [[setting_up_charity_funds_in_notion | setting up charity funds in Notion]] or providing an [[overview_and_summary_of_donations_in_notion | overview and summary of donations in Notion]]).

The allocation amounts for investments, savings, and others are number properties, typically set in US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

#### Total Allocation and Proportion
The "total allocation" is the summation of investments, savings, and other allocations, represented by a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The "percentage of allocation" is calculated by dividing the total allocation by the total available funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This formula result is formatted as a percentage and can be displayed visually with a bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

#### Fund Allocation Overview and Quarterly Allocation
The dashboard features:

*   **Fund Allocation Overview** Gives an analysis of remaining funds allocated to different heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Each individual allocation is linked to an "allocation of funds" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, displayed in a gallery view showing the investment source, allocation amount, and percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Allocation Overview** Provides a monthly allocation overview, showing total available funds for each month and the proportion of funds allocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This is linked to an "available funds" database and displayed in a gallery mode view, showing the month, total available funds, and percentage of allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The information is filtered for each quarter (Q1: Jan-Mar, Q2: Apr-Jun, Q3: Jul-Sep, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### Notion Concepts Utilized

The budget planner leverages several Notion features for effective [[operational_management_of_assets_using_notion | operational management of assets using Notion]]:

*   **Inline Databases** Used to create and manage income, expense, and allocation details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Properties** Various property types are used:
    *   **Title** For names like "income details" or "expense source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Number** For expected/actual income, budgeted/actual expense, investments, savings, and other allocations, with currency formatting (e.g., US dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   **Formula** For calculating differences (actual minus expected income/expense), percentages (e.g., proportion of actual income to budgeted income), and total allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Conditional `if` formulas are also used for displaying specific roll-up values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   **Relation** To link different databases, such as linking income details to "income type," "month of income," and "frequency of income" databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Roll-up Property** Used extensively to aggregate information from related databases (e.g., total actual income for a specific source, total expected income for a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This allows pulling desired properties and applying calculations like `sum` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Linked Databases** Allow displaying filtered views of existing databases on the main dashboard, such as quarterly overviews or variance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Views** Databases can be displayed in different layouts like Gallery mode or List mode, with specific properties made visible or hidden to suit the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

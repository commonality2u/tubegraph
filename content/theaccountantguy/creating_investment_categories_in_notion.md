The Investment Portfolio tracker in Notion allows users to categorize their investments for better organization and tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This is part of [[Using Notion for financial management | Notion's financial management capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Default Investment Categories

Upon starting with the tracker, the investment section is typically divided into pre-defined categories such as "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Examples include two stocks and one crypto already added to demonstrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Adding Custom Investment Categories

Users can add their own custom categories to further tailor the tracker to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

To add a new category:
1.  Locate the investment section and click the plus icon to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  A prompt will appear, allowing you to type in the name for your new category, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
3.  Once the name is entered, a new section for this category will automatically be added to your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Assigning Investments to Categories

When [[adding_and_editing_investments_in_notion | adding new investments]], or for existing ones, you can classify them into appropriate categories:
*   After adding an investment, it might initially be placed under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   To assign it, click on the three-dot icon next to the investment and move it to the desired category, such as "stocks" or "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The investment will then be automatically placed under that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Modifying and Deleting Categories

*   **Editing**: To edit an existing category name, click on the item you wish to change, type in the new name, and click "done" to modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Deleting**: Categories can also be deleted if no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This categorization helps in viewing your investment portfolio with different classifications like stocks, cryptos, and any custom groups you define <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

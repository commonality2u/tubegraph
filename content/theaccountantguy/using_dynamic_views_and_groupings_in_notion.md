The Notion Savings Funds Tracker provides a dashboard with dynamic views and grouping options to manage financial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Dashboard Overview
The main dashboard includes two primary views:
*   **Savings Target** - Where users can set different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview** - Displays the total amount saved against the targeted amount, showing progress in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Transaction Panel and Dynamic Grouping
The "transactions panel" located at the bottom of the dashboard is where individual savings contributions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. All transactions are automatically split and grouped by different months, with the most recent months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Customizing Data Presentation
The view of these transactions is highly [[customizing_data_presentation_in_notion | customizable]] and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
To alter the grouping:
1.  Click on the three-dot menu associated with the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Grouping" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  By default, the grouping is set by date, organized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
4.  Users can change this grouping to display transactions by:
    *   **Week** - Showing savings made on a weekly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   **Year** - Presenting transactions grouped by year (e.g., 2024, 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

These changes dynamically update the display of information according to the selected setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

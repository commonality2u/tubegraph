The employee paycheck tracker is a [[notion_template_for_employee_payment_tracking | simple template]] designed to keep track of all employee payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It facilitates [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | understanding transaction classifications and payment frequencies]] by allowing users to specify how employees are paid, whether on a monthly or hourly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Records Section

The "Records" section of the tracker is where detailed information about each employee is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This includes whether an employee is permanent, the payments due to them, the number of months of payment outstanding, and how they are compensated (monthly or hourly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This section helps define the basis for payment calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New employees or categories can be added easily within this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Payment Entry

To record a payment, users can input the date and period for which the payment is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A description of the payment can also be added, and the specific employee can be selected from a dropdown list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Hourly Payments

For employees paid on an hourly basis, the template allows users to specify the `pay rate` and the `number of hours` worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The system will then automatically calculate the total payment amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Monthly Payments

If an employee is paid on a monthly basis, users can specify the `pay rate` and leave the `hours` column blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This indicates that the employee is paid monthly, and the system will factor this into its calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Tracking Payment Status

A dedicated column in the payment entry section indicates whether a payment has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. If a payment is due but not yet paid, this can be unticked, signifying it as unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Summary and Quarterly Breakdown

The template includes a "Payment" section and a "Summary" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, both part of the [[sections_in_the_paycheck_tracker__records_payments_and_summary | sections in the paycheck tracker: records, payments and summary]]. These sections provide an overview of the total paycheck due, the amount paid, the balance due, and any advance payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | summary section to track payment totals]] also shows the percentage of the total paycheck that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Additionally, a "Quarterly" section provides a [[monthly_and_quarterly_contribution_breakdown | breakdown of total paychecks due]], amounts paid, and net balances for each quarter and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This quarterly overview is further divided into permanent and contractual employee payments, based on the classifications entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

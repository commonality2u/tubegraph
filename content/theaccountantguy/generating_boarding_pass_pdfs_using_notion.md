This article details how to [[generating_pdfs_in_bulk_with_notion | generate PDF documents]] for boarding passes directly from Notion, leveraging its database and template features with a tool called PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To begin, you need two main components within Notion:
*   **Boarding Pass Database** A database containing a list of all necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Boarding Pass Template** A pre-designed [[creating_pdf_documents_with_notion_templates | template]] specifically for the boarding pass layout from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This template is crucial for [[using_a_boarding_pass_template_in_notion | using a boarding pass template in Notion]] to create the desired document format.

## Process for Generating PDFs

The process involves connecting the Notion database and template to [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | PDF Output]] to facilitate the generation of documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

1.  **Access PDF Output** Navigate to the connection details within the PDF Output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Name the Connection** Enter "boarding pass" as the name for the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
3.  **Connect Database** Select the "boarding pass database" from your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
4.  **Select Template** Choose the "boarding pass template" that will be used for the PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
5.  **Load Information** Click "next" to initiate the loading of all information from the connected database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
6.  **Export Documents** Once the information is loaded, click "export" to begin [[exporting_pdf_documents_from_notion | exporting PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The system will start [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Verification and Download

After the export is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:

*   **Preview Sample** You can click "preview sample" to view a generated boarding pass, confirming it includes all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Download Files** The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Open and Review** Once downloaded and extracted, you can open the individual PDF files to see the generated boarding passes, each with different names and contexts based on your database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

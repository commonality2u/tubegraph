This guide demonstrates how to [[generating_pdfs_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | generate boarding pass PDF documents]] using Notion in conjunction with [[generating_pdfs_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | PDF output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To begin, you will need two main components in Notion:
*   A [[using_a_boarding_pass_database_in_notion | boarding pass database]] containing all the necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A boarding pass template, which will be used to structure the generated PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Generating the PDFs

The process involves connecting your Notion database and template to [[connecting_and_setting_up_pdf_output_with_notion | PDF output]] and then initiating the export process:

1.  **Connect to PDF output**: In the connection details of [[connecting_and_setting_up_pdf_output_with_notion | PDF output]], enter "boarding pass" for the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Select Database**: Choose the "boarding pass database" from your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Select Template**: Select the "boarding pass template" that will define the layout of your PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to allow [[connecting_and_setting_up_pdf_output_with_notion | PDF output]] to load all information from the selected Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once the information is fully loaded, click "export" to start [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdfoutput | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Previewing and Downloading

After a successful export, you can verify and access the generated files:

*   **Preview**: Click "preview sample" to view a sample of the generated boarding pass, confirming that all details from the database have been correctly included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Download**: You can then proceed to download all the generated PDF files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The downloaded files can be extracted and opened to confirm their contents, which will include multiple boarding passes with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

This method allows for the efficient [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdfoutput | bulk generation of PDF documents]] directly from your Notion data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

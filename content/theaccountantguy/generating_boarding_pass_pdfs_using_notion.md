It is possible to [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion | generate PDF documents]] for boarding passes directly from Notion databases using a tool called [[pdf_document_creation_with_notion_and_pdf_output | PDF output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>.

## Prerequisites

To generate boarding pass PDFs, two main components are needed:
*   A "boarding pass database" in Notion that contains all the necessary details for each boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a>. This database serves as the source of information for the PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>.
*   A [[using_a_boarding_pass_template_in_notion | boarding pass template]] in Notion, which acts as the design blueprint for the generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>.

## Process

The process of [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion | generating PDF documents]] involves connecting the [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion_databases | Notion databases]] to the [[pdf_document_creation_with_notion_and_pdf_output | PDF output]] tool and specifying the template:
1.  Access the "connection details" within [[pdf_document_creation_with_notion_and_pdf_output | PDF output]] and type in "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>.
2.  Connect to the "boarding pass database" by selecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>.
3.  Select the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>.
4.  The system will then load all the information from the connected database and the selected template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>.
5.  Once the data is loaded, click "export" to begin the PDF generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43"></a>.

## Results

After the export process is complete:
*   The export will be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>.
*   A sample preview can be accessed to verify that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>.
*   The generated PDF files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.
*   Multiple PDF outputs are generated, each corresponding to a row in the [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database_rows | Notion database]], showcasing different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21"></a>.

This method allows for the efficient creation of various PDF documents using Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30"></a>.

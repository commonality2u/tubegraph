A Notion template can be used to set up a small business bookkeeping system, helping to track all bookkeeping needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Template Structure
The small business bookkeeping template is divided into three main sections:
*   **Start Here** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## 1. Start Here Section
This section is used to enter initial business information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Accounts
The accounts section allows you to manage different financial categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   **Expenses**: e.g., purchase expense, utility bills, subscriptions, salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: e.g., accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

#### Managing Accounts
*   **Editing**: Hover over an item, click the pencil icon, edit details, and click outside to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

#### Account Details
For each account, you can add specific details:

## How to Use the Template
To effectively use the template:
1.  Start by setting up different accounts under the respective heads in the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
2.  Add opening balances for relevant assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
3.  Enter details for every business transaction in the "Transactions" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
This process automatically updates all summary sections, providing an at-a-glance view of business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

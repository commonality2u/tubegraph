A savings funds tracker provides a dedicated transactions panel to record and monitor contributions to your various savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This panel allows you to see how your savings are accumulating over time and how they contribute to your overall financial targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Adding a New Savings Transaction

To add a new savings contribution:
1.  Navigate to the "transactions panel" located at the bottom of the tracker interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
2.  Click on the "add transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
3.  A new transaction entry will automatically appear, pre-filled with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. You can click on the date to select a different one from the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
4.  Enter descriptive information for the transaction, such as "saving for car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
5.  In the "saving fund" column, click to reveal a list of all your previously [[editing_and_managing_savings_goals | added saving funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Select the specific fund to which this transaction applies, for example, "car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
6.  Input the "saving amount" for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Tracking and Overview Updates

Once a savings amount is entered for a transaction:
*   The total savings for that specific fund will automatically update in the "savings overview" section at the top of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   The system dynamically calculates and displays the current total savings, the targeted amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This allows for an immediate overview of your progress towards your savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Customizing Transaction Views

The transactions panel is designed to be dynamic and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. By default, transactions are grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. However, you can alter this view:
1.  Click on the three dots icon within the transactions panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
2.  Select the "grouping" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
3.  Under the date settings, you can choose to group transactions by week, month, or year, to suit your preferred tracking method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. For instance, changing to "year" will display transactions grouped by the year they occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Currency Customization
The tracker supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. To change the currency display, click on any amount, then "edit property," and select a different "number format" which reflects various currencies supported by [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The Investment Portfolio tracker utilizes quick action buttons to streamline the process of [[entering_and_managing_transactions | entering and managing transactions]] related to your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These buttons are designed to simplify the recording of both buy and sell [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## How Quick Action Buttons Work

Quick action buttons are accessible within the tracker to facilitate rapid data entry for investment [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Buy Investment Button
Clicking the "Buy Investment" quick action button automatically adds a new entry under the "Buy" view in the [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_Notion | transactions]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Automatic Date Entry**: When activated, the button automatically populates the entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This date can be manually changed if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Data Input**: Users can then fill in the necessary details such as the investment account, number of units, and buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The buy amount is automatically calculated based on the units and price entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Sell Investment Button
Similarly, clicking the "Sell Investment" quick action button creates a new line item directly under the "Sell" view of the [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transactions]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Sales Entry**: This allows for quick input of [[sales_transaction_entry_and_management | sales transaction]] details, including the date, investment account, units sold, and selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

These buttons simplify the process of [[entering_transactions_in_Notion | entering transactions]] by pre-populating certain fields and directing the entry to the correct transaction category, making it easier to [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_Notion | manage accounts and transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

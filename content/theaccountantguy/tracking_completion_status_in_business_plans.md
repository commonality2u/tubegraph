A business plan template can be utilized to streamline the planning process for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template offers two primary views for [[tracking_business_activities | tracking business activities]]: the "Business Plan Road Map" and the "Events Timeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This system can be implemented using [[using_notion_for_business_tracking | Notion]] to manage and monitor progress.

### Business Plan Road Map

The "Business Plan Road Map" view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages, such as "Conceptional Research," "Planning and Structuring," and extending to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template predefines 11 stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These stages can be customized to fit specific needs using an edit icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

For each business plan, users can define objectives and specify which stage it corresponds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A key feature is the "completion in percentage" metric, which tracks overall progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

#### Task Management within Stages

Clicking on any stage in the road map reveals the tasks associated with that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, "Conception and Research" might have two tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Each task includes:
*   A defined deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   A checkbox to indicate task completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   An option to assign a status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added for any specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Detailed documentation, including objectives and tasks, can be added within each stage's section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

#### Automatic Completion Tracking

One of the most useful features is the automatic update of the completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. When a task's completion checkbox is marked, the percentage for that stage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Completing both tasks will bring it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Events Timeline

The "Events Timeline" view provides a calendar and timeline format of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The name of the stage and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The status of each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

This timeline offers a quick visual overview of all planned business activities and their deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Clicking on elements within the timeline can navigate to specific dates or details of stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

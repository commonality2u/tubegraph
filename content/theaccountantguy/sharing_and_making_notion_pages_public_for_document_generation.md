To successfully generate PDF documents from Notion, it is crucial to share your Notion page and make it publicly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This step ensures that external tools, such as PDFOutput, can access the content of your Notion template for [[generating_pdfs_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Why Public Access is Necessary

Making your Notion page public allows the PDF generation service to read the content of your template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This is essential for the service to identify placeholders (e.g., text within curly brackets) and replace them with data from your Notion database, as part of the process for [[creating_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_generation | creating Notion templates and databases for PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Steps to Share and Publish a Notion Page

Follow these steps to make your Notion page public:

1.  **Open the Notion Page**: Navigate to the Notion page that contains your document template, such as a professional invoice template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
2.  **Access Share Options**: In the top right corner of your Notion page, click on the "Share" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  **Publish to Web**: In the share menu, select "Publish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Publication**: Click "Publish" again to confirm and make the page public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This action makes the page available for use by external services like PDFOutput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
5.  **Copy Page URL**: Once published, click "Share" again and then "Copy link" to obtain the public URL of your Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This URL will be used in the PDF generation platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> It is a key reminder that for the page, you need to share it and make it public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This step must be completed before pasting the Notion page URL into the PDF generation platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This public URL, along with a Notion API key and the database URL, are the necessary inputs for tools to begin [[connecting_notion_templates_with_pdf_output | connecting Notion templates with PDF output]] and [[generating_pdfs_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | generating PDFs from Notion using PDFOutput]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

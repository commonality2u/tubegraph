This article explains how to track and manage emergency fund contributions on a monthly and quarterly basis using a dedicated template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes sections for fund setup, a savings overview, and a summary of savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Contribution Section

The template features a dedicated contribution section where users can input money towards each emergency savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Monthly Contributions

Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For each contribution, the following details are recorded:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Period** (users can select predefined months or add new ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **Fund** (users select from the emergency funds previously set up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   **Amount** of savings or contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

A "Requirement" column on the right side indicates how much contribution is needed each month to meet the targeted end goal by the specified date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If the entered contribution amount meets or exceeds the required amount, a tick mark appears, signaling that the monthly requirement for that specific fund has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Adding New Contributions

To add a new contribution, users can utilize the "quick action" button, which automatically adds a new line item for the current month and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Users can then fill in the details or select a different date, which will automatically attach the entry to the corresponding month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## [[sinking_funds_progress_and_contributions_analysis | Quarterly Overview]]

The [[sinking_funds_progress_and_contributions_analysis | quarterly overview]] provides a single-glance view of contributions across all months within each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For example, January, February, and March fall under Quarter 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This section reflects the total savings made for each month and compares it against the required amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It also displays the percentage of the savings requirement met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Different colors are used to provide a quick visual snapshot of financial progress regarding emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The [[sinking_funds_progress_and_contributions_analysis | quarterly overview]] also shows the total savings accumulated for each quarter, which updates as more emergency fund contributions are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

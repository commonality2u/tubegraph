A [[using_notion_for_inventory_management | Notion]] template is available to help users keep track of all home inventory in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This simple template provides an overview of purchases, categories, and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is divided into several key sections:

### Purchase Summary
On the left side of the template, users can view a summary of their purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This includes:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total purchases that have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made in comparison to estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

### Inventory Categories
The right side of the template features an "Inventory Categories" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Here, users can set up different categories for their inventory, such as "Darian eggs," "medicines," and "fruits and veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Each category lists its subcategories along with the estimated budgeted purchase amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Inventory Overview
The "Inventory Overview" section provides key metrics for all subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

### Transaction Section
The "Transaction Section" allows users to specify inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, a "cheese purchase" can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. When an entry is clicked, details such as subcategory items, inventory items purchased, and the purchase amount are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

To track consumption, users can add new entries specifying the number of "items used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the template's different subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, allowing users to track available inventory and required consumption for every item at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Customization
This template is entirely customizable to meet individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For further customization assistance, users can reach out via email at notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

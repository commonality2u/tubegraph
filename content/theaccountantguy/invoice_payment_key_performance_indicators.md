Tracking invoice payments is essential for managing business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A Notion template can provide a quick invoice payment summary at the top, displaying various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Core Invoice Payment KPIs

The template features several KPIs that can be used to analyze business performance related to invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These can be customized or new ones can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The primary KPIs available are:
*   **Total Expenses** The total amount incurred through invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This value updates automatically based on changes to individual invoice inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Total Units Purchased** The combined total of units purchased across all invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This KPI also updates automatically when unit quantities are changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Average Invoice Price** The average price of all invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Client Summary KPIs

In addition to overall KPIs, the template includes a client summary that breaks down purchases by client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For each client, the following details are displayed:
*   **Total Purchases by Client** The sum of purchases made from a specific client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, for "11 Enterprises," the total purchase might be $189 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Units Purchased by Client** The total number of units acquired from a particular client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For instance, "11 Enterprises" might show a total of 44 units purchased (e.g., 31 + 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Average Purchase Value by Client** The average value of purchases made from each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The [[setting_up_an_employee_schedule_template | employee schedule template]] in Notion helps organizations keep track of employee schedules and related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template offers multiple views to manage employee data, task assignments, and performance monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Key Views

The template is organized into four primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
*   **Employee Details** Lists employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule** Allows for entering tasks for employees based on dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Monthly View** Shows months divided into quarters, displaying total hours worked and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance** Provides exact performance information broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Employee Details

This section is where new employees are added and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Adding Employees** Click "new" to add an employee under relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Information such as name, employee ID, contact information, department, position, and email ID can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Categories** Pre-defined categories like Operations, Marketing, and Finance are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. New categories can be added using the plus icon, and existing ones can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button** An "add employee" button is available at the top for quickly adding a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Task Schedule

After adding employee details, the task schedule section is used to assign tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Shifts** Tasks are divided into shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Time Tracking** Employees can enter desired start and end times, indicating the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Task Details** Task-related information can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Employee Assignment** Employees can be assigned to tasks by selecting their name from the previously added employee list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. New employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Department Auto-computation** The respective department is automatically displayed for each assigned employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Attendance** Employees can mark their attendance as "present," "on leave," or "day off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Task Status** The status of a task can be updated to "in progress," "completed," or "not started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In cases like a day off or leave, the status can be marked as "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Monthly View

The monthly view provides an overview of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   It displays months divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Shows total hours worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Indicates total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Calculates the total hours, which is the summation of working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This view offers a quick overview of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

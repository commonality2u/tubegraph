A template can be utilized to keep track of house rental payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template features a summary section with four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Basic Information
This view allows for the addition of basic information, such as tenants, classified under different property types that you own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, properties can be classified as "apartment" or "duplex," and users can add other classifications as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

To add a tenant:
1.  Click the "Add tenant" button on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This will automatically create a new tenant entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  Click the three-dot icon to place the new tenant under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon and add the tenant's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Property Section
This section displays different classifications of properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Underneath each property, you can view:

### [[overview_of_rental_payment_history | Rental History]]
This view shows the rental history for all tenants who have previously paid rent, based on the transactions booked at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Overall Summary
The final summary section displays key financial figures:

## Transaction Section

The transaction section offers three different views, in addition to a view showing all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Rent Paid
Under "Rent Paid," you can view all transactions for which rent has been paid, along with the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Rent Due
The "Rent Due" view provides information for rent that is due and has not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Clicking the checkbox next to an entry indicates that the rent has been paid, and it will then move to the "Rent Paid" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

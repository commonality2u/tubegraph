This guide demonstrates how to [[setting_up_whatsapp_subscription_payment_reminders | receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp]] by utilizing a database and custom templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This method helps in receiving timely notifications for recurring payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Setting Up a Subscription Reminder Template

To set up a subscription payment reminder:
1.  **Access the Database**: Navigate to the relevant database interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Create a New Template**: Click on the drop-down menu and select the option to [[creating_templates_for_recurring_payment_reminders | create a new template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This action will provide an option for [[customizing_subscription_reminder_alerts | setting up a subscription reminder alert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Enter Subscription Details**:
    *   **Name**: Specify the name of the subscription, e.g., "Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the subscription amount, e.g., "$150" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
4.  **Set Repetition**:
    *   After adding the template, click on the three dots associated with the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Select "repeat" and choose the desired frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures the reminder repeats the specified subscription amount monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
5.  **Specify Time and Date**:
    *   A new window will appear, allowing you to set the specific time and start date for the reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   For example, you can set the time to 11:56 AM and have it repeat on the 23rd of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" to confirm the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. An arrow icon will indicate that the reminder is set to repeat automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## How the Automation Works

Once the reminder is set, the system will:
*   Automatically add a new line item in the database at the specified time on the designated day of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Concurrently, a notification alert will be automatically sent to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   The WhatsApp message will inform you about the payment reminder for the subscription, including the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   The notification will also include a "pay now" link, allowing for direct payment through the provided link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Customization and Support

The reminder alerts received on WhatsApp are fully [[customizing_payment_alert_messages | customizable]] to meet individual requirements, meaning there isn't a fixed template for the messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. When you download the template, it comes with instructions and a guide to help you set up this automation independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

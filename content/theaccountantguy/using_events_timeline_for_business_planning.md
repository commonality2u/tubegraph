The [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion | business plan template]] in Notion includes an "events timeline" view, which provides a visual representation of business planning stages and tasks in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This view helps in quickly understanding the planned schedule and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Overview of the Events Timeline

The events timeline displays all information previously set up in the [[business_plan_road_map_and_stages | business plan road map]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This includes:
*   **Specific Deadline Dates** The timeline clearly shows the deadlines set for different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For example, a timeline might show dates like "December 3 to December 20" for specific stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Stage Information** For each stage, the timeline displays the stage name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Associated Tasks** Tasks linked to each stage are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Dates and Status** Alongside tasks, their respective dates and current status are shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Navigating the Timeline

Small arrows on the timeline reflect the dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Clicking on any of these arrows will direct you to the specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, allowing you to view detailed information for all stages and their associated properties for that particular date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

This [[visualizing_event_data_in_calendar_and_board_views_in_notion | calendar and timeline format]] offers a quick visual summary of all planned activities for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

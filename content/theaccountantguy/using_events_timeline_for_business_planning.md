The business plan template offers two primary views to facilitate [[stages_of_business_planning | business planning]]: the Business Plan Roadmap and the Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The Events Timeline view helps users visualize their business plan in a dynamic calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Key Features of the Events Timeline

The Events Timeline provides a comprehensive overview of planned activities and their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Visualizing Deadlines**
    *   It displays specific deadline dates for tasks and stages, such as a timeline from December 3 to December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Detailed Task Information**
    *   For each stage, the timeline shows the stage name and all associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Each task includes its date and current status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Navigation and Properties**
    *   Small arrows within the timeline reflect the dates and necessary properties for all stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Clicking on these arrows directs the user to the specific date, revealing detailed information about all stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This feature is integral for [[tracking_business_activities | tracking business activities]] and ensuring that planning is organized and easily reviewable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

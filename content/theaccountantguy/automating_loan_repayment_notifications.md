This guide, presented by Sanam Biswal (The Accountant Guide), demonstrates how to [[setting_up_debt_payment_reminders_on_WhatsApp | set up debt payment reminders]] that arrive as notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These alerts are designed to notify users on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Notification Overview

An example notification shows a "Debt Payment Reminder Alert" for a car loan of $3,000 due on September 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The message typically includes:
*   A personalized greeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The type of loan (e.g., car loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   The amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   An integrated "Pay Now" link that redirects to a bank portal or payment service (e.g., PayPal) to facilitate instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This link is customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The entire message content is fully modifiable for individual purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Setting Up Payment Reminders

To receive [[benefits_of_automated_payment_reminders_for_timely_payments | automated payment reminders]] on WhatsApp, the primary step is to [[creating_recurring_payment_reminders | create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Creating Loan Templates

1.  **Add Loan Details**: Create a new template and input the specific loan details, such as "car loan" and a repayment amount of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  **Set Repetition**: For loans requiring regular payments, set the template to repeat. The repetition feature automatically populates all values within the template for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   For monthly payments, select "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Specify a date for the repetition to occur, for instance, the 16th of each month, along with a specific time and time zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This ensures that the loan entry is automatically added to the database on that chosen date each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Adjusting Notification Timing

The system allows you to customize when you receive the notification relative to the actual loan due date:
*   **Receive Early Notification**: To get a reminder, for example, 7 days before the actual due date, input "7" in the "days" field. This means if the due date is September 23, and the notification date is September 16, you will receive the alert on September 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Receive On Due Date**: To receive the notification on the exact due date, change the setting to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The notification will then align with the set repetition date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Once a recurring template for a loan (e.g., car loan) is set, it will repeat every month on the specified date, triggering an automation that sends the payment notification message to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Demonstration

A new loan, "Education Loan," was set up to occur at 3:55 PM on September 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. At the exact time of 3:55 PM, the new loan entry automatically populated in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, which then triggered the payment alert notification to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This system can automate notifications for any number of loans a user has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Customization and Management

*   **Custom Messages**: Users can create custom messages tailored to their requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Template Deletion**: Once a loan has been fully repaid, the corresponding template can be deleted to prevent further recurring notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This system provides a simple automation technique to manage [[loan_and_repayment_details_management | loan and repayment details management]] and receive timely notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

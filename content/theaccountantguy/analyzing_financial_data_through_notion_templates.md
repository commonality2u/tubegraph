An Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to utilize a [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | monthly budget planner]] in [[using_notion_for_finance_management | Notion]] to streamline personal [[using_notion_templates_for_budget_management | budgeting]] and financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[notion_finance_templates | Notion template]] offers a comprehensive way to manage and track expenses across different periods and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Template Views

The [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | monthly budget planner]] provides four distinct views for financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>: This view lists specific expense categories (e.g., shopping, entertainment, food, utilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it shows:
    *   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
    *   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
    *   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
    *   A status indicating if the budget has been exceeded or is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: Displays all discussed expenses categorized by month, offering a quick glance at monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>: Presents the same expense information as the monthly view but in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: Provides a complete expense overview in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to show overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering and Managing Financial Data

The template utilizes an "expense details database" for data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

Transactions are entered into the expense details database, where they are automatically categorized by month and sorted in descending order (later months appearing at the top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

To enter a transaction:
1.  Click "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The template automatically modifies the month based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Enter the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Select the category (e.g., "utilities"). Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  Input an expense code, used to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This column is for recording the actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Setting Budgets

At the beginning of each month, users can set a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
1.  Select the date (e.g., the first day of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period and year as done for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the category (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For budgets, the expense name and category name typically remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  Set the expense code (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  Enter the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This column is used at the start of the month to set the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Once entered, all figures in the top views for respective months and categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Performance

After booking expenses, the template allows for detailed financial analysis through its interconnected views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*   **Period Analysis**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window displaying all transactions booked for that period, including amounts and whether they were budgeted or actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This offers a quick glance at the month's financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Yearly Analysis**: Similarly, clicking on a year provides a summary view with budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expense percentages, and budget status for the entire year, along with all yearly transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Category Analysis**: Users can analyze spending by category, viewing expense and budgeted amounts, expense percentages, and status for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also shows a list of all transactions related to that specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Expense Code Tracking**: The expense code feature allows tracking amounts booked for a particular category of expense within a specific month, comparing it against the total budget for that item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, all top-level overviews automatically update, providing insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This comprehensive approach to [[using_notion_for_financial_summary_and_budget_management | financial summary]] and [[using_notion_templates_for_budget_management | budget management]] allows users to keep track of their finances through the four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

This template can be further customized to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For support or questions, contact notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

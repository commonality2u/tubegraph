The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users track their paycheck payments and budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The main interface of the budget tracker is divided into two primary sections: the Summary section on the left and the Account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Components of the Budget Tracker

### Summary Section
The Summary section provides a quick overview of financial performance relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses that have been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses that have been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted expenses and the total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
This section aids in [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | expense analysis and budgeting]] by providing immediate feedback on spending habits.

### Account Section
The Account section on the right side allows users to categorize and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can add their expenses under three default categories:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | change these categories]] to different custom items by clicking on them, [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | setting a new category]], and confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, users can [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | set a budgeted amount]] for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Transaction Section
After setting up accounts and budgeted amounts, users move to the Transaction section. Here, all individual transactions related to every expense are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These transactions automatically update the expense section, showing:
*   The total budgeted amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
This mechanism enables [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly budget tracking]] and ensures users stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Quick Action Buttons
The tracker also includes quick action buttons to streamline data entry:
*   **Add Transaction**: Clicking this button automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing the user to fill in the specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source**: This button automatically adds a new expense entry under one of the main expense heads (e.g., Fixed Expenses). Users can then reposition this new entry as needed within the account structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Overall, these [[components_of_the_budget_tracker | components of the budget tracker]] work together to help users manage their budgeted payments effectively and maintain control over their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

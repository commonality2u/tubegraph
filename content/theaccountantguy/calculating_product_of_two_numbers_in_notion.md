This article explains how to [[Formulas for multiplication in Notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a Notion database using different formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Database Setup
To [[Formulas for multiplication in Notion | calculate the product of two numbers]], a database is created consisting of two number properties and a formula property to display the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

The database typically includes:
*   **Name Property**: A title property, which for this example is the "name of the operator", specifically the [[Using multiply operator in Notion | multiply operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Number Properties**: Two number properties, each assigned to a different number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Methods for Calculating Product

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula
This method involves using a formula property where the `multiply` operator is applied to the two input numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance, if the numbers are 2 and 3, the product will be 6 using this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiplication Symbol
Another formula can be used that simply multiplies the two numbers directly using the multiplication symbol (`*`) placed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Both formulas can be used to [[Formulas for multiplication in Notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

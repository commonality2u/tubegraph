This article explains how to utilize a travel expense tracker to keep track of all travel expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The tracker includes a summary section that covers accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories (Accounts View)

To begin, you set up different expenses in the Accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Any expense incurred will be booked under one of these [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Expense Sources

*   **Adding a New Source**: You can quickly add a new expense source by clicking "add expense source," which automatically adds it under a travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, "Metro" can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: Click the pencil icon to edit the details of an expense source and set its [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For instance, Metro could have a [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]] of $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Moving Categories**: Expense sources can be moved between existing categories, such as from Travel to Meals, by clicking on the three dots icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Creating New Categories**: To add a completely new category (group) separate from existing ones like Travel, Meals, and Lodging, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Groups**: Existing groups can also be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Each expense source has a [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]] set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Tracking Budgeted vs Actual Expenses

The "Expenses" section provides a detailed [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budgeted vs actual expenses tracking]] for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

It displays:
*   The total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   The [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]] set for that expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   The percentage of what has been spent relative to the [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This view helps in [[comparison_of_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses | comparing actual vs budgeted expenses]].

### Visual Cues for Performance

*   **Red Indication**: If actual expenses exceed the [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]], it is indicated in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For example, a flight expense of $2,000 against a budgeted $1,000 shows 200% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Green Indication**: If actual expenses are within or below the [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]], the figure is shown in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For instance, breakfast costing $100 against a $300 budget shows 33% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This classification allows for a quick [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | one-glance view]] of where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The summary section provides a complete overview of the [[budget_and_actual_expenses_comparison | budgeted and actual expenses comparison]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

It includes:
*   Total [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense]] set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage reflecting total expenses divided by [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, $3,600 incurred out of $6,100 budgeted reflects almost 59% of the [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense]] reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:03:02]</a>.

This helps in [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly budget tracking]] and overall financial oversight.

## Booking Expenses

Expenses are classified under three main categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Adding New Expenses

*   **Quick Addition**: Use quick addition buttons (e.g., "add travel expense," "add lodging expense") to swiftly add a new expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This automatically inputs the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Expense Details**: You can then add:
    *   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Trip info (e.g., "trip to Paris"), which can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Account of the expense (e.g., bus, Metro, train, flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   Amount (e.g., $100 for a train expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it is reflected in the expense summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amount]] is set for that specific expense (e.g., $200 for train), the tracker will show the percentage of the [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense]] incurred (e.g., 50% in green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This tool helps understand current expense standing and plan future expenditures based on tracked data, aiding in overall [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | budgeting and tracking business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

This guide demonstrates how to create a new bill payment reminder template to help [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | set up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Steps to Create a New Template

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "New Template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of your bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount (e.g., $1500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "Back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Up Recurring Payments

To set the bill to repeat on a [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring basis]]:
1.  Click the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Choose the frequency for the payment, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day when you want to receive the notification (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

This setup ensures that notifications will be sent to your WhatsApp on the specified date and time each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## WhatsApp Notification and Automation

For this functionality, an automation tool like Pabbly Connect is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation setup within Pabbly Connect comes with an explanation and guide when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Once the template is set on a recurring basis, notifications will be automatically received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, a mobile bill added to the system will trigger a WhatsApp notification at the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The notification typically arrives in under a minute from the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

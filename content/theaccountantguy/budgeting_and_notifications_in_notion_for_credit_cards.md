This article explains how a Notion-based tracker can be used for managing credit card finances, including features for [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]] and notifications for timely repayments.

## Credit Card Overview and Tracking
The tracker provides a comprehensive overview of your credit card finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It displays a list of all added credit cards, such as "Student Credit Card," "Cash Back Credit Card," "Travel Credit Card," and "Rewards Credit Card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For each card, you can view the total amount due, the amount already repaid, and the remaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The system includes:
*   **Monthly Overview** A section that summarizes the total amount due, amount repaid, and balance due for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This can be customized to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Displays the total amount due, amount repaid, and balance due for different years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Expense Detail Management
To begin [[credit_card_expenses_tracking_in_notion | tracking credit card expenses]], you need to log them in the expense details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Each expense entry includes:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   **Expense Details** A description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Period** The specific month or period for which the expense is booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Year** The year of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Credit Card** The associated credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. New credit cards can be added as you enter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Category** An assigned category for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. You can add or edit categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Expense Amount** The monetary value of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance Due** For balances carried forward from previous months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Receipts** You can attach bills or receipts to each expense entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

When repaying an amount for a credit card, you simply enter the "repayment amount" in the designated column, often detailing it as "credit card repayment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. All entered details automatically update the overview sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Budgeting]] with Expenses Overview
The "Expenses Overview" section is crucial for [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budgeting]] by providing a summary of all recorded expenses across different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This section allows you to:
*   **Categorize Expenses** Expenses are grouped into categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Track Total Expenses** See the total amount spent for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Set Budgeted Amounts** You can set a specific budget for each expense category by clicking on the budget amount and entering your desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Budget Status** The system indicates whether your spending is "under budget" (within the set limit) or "over budget" (exceeding the limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. For example, spending $5,300 against a $5,000 budget would reflect as "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Repayment Notifications
The "Notification" section helps you manage your credit card repayments by showing when the next payment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Key features of the notification system:
*   **Next Repayment Date** Displays the upcoming repayment date for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Days Remaining** Shows how many days are left until the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Setting Repayment Dates** You can manually set or adjust the repayment date for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
This feature helps in [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | tracking debt]] and ensuring timely payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Detailed Views and Customization
Beyond the main dashboards, the tracker offers several detailed views and customization options:
*   **Period Summarization** Clicking on a particular period (e.g., a month) opens a new window showing transaction details like date, period, transaction details, amount, and tags (e.g., green for repayment, red for expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Year Summarization** Similar to period view, but for a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Credit Card Specific View** Clicking on a credit card shows all transactions related to that card, its status, and allows adding categories to the credit card itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Category Specific View** Clicking on an expense category displays all expenses recorded under that category with relevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Editing and Adding** You can edit existing credit card information or add new credit cards and categories using designated icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The template is customizable to personal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

To effectively manage finances in Notion, a [[building_dashboard_views_in_notion | primary dashboard]] is used to present income tracking information. This dashboard integrates five distinct databases: Income Details, Income Source, Frequency of Income, Total Earnings, and Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The overall goal is to provide a clear and minimalistic view of income data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Primary Dashboard Structure

The [[building_dashboard_views_in_notion | primary dashboard]] is designed with several key sections for a comprehensive overview of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Total Earnings

This section of the [[primary_dashboard_of_notion_bills_tracker | primary dashboard]] displays the total income earned over a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. It is a linked view of the `Total Earnings` database, presented in a list view format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Sources of Income

This section utilizes a three-column layout to present information about different income sources such as salary, side hustles, and other earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
To create this layout:
1.  Type `/` and then select `three columns` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
2.  Each column is then linked to the `Income Source` database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
3.  The information is displayed in a gallery format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This view shows the actual income and the percentage each source contributes to the total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Frequency of Income

This section provides insights into how frequently income is earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It is derived from the `Frequency of Income` database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
This section is also presented in a gallery format, showing the total earnings and the number of sources for each frequency (e.g., monthly, annual, one-time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Overview Section (Quarterly Breakdown)

The overview section is linked to the `Period` database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> and is presented in a gallery mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. It segregates monthly income into four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
Within this section:
*   Information is divided into four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Individual months are specified for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   It displays earnings for each month and their proportion to the total earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   Filters are applied to each quarter view to specify the respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

This comprehensive dashboard setup allows for effective tracking and analysis of income using Notion's database and [[creating_visual_presentations_of_data_in_notion | presentation]] features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

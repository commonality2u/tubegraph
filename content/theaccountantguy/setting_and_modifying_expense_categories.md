The business expense tracker is designed to help users keep track of all their business expenses in one general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The "Expense Categories" section allows you to define the various expenses your business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Predefined Categories

The tracker comes with some predefined categories for business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **Modifying Categories:** To [[customizing_expense_categories | modify or change a main category]], click on it and then click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Changing Subcategories:** To [[customizing_expense_categories | change a subcategory]], click the pencil icon next to it to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Adding New Categories

You can [[customizing_expense_categories | add a new category]] of your choice by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts

Within the expense categories, you can [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | set a budgeted amount for each expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Whatever amount you set will automatically be reflected later in the "Expenses Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

For example, if the budget for "advertising" is changed from $100 to $5,000, all related figures in the "Expenses Overview" will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

This section provides a summary of:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Budgeted expenses set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   A percentage indicating whether you are over or within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Transaction Side

In the "Transaction" section, you can enter your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   Select the date, which will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Enter a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

On the left side, a summary dynamically updates to show:
*   Budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

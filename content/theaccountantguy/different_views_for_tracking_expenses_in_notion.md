A [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | monthly budget planner]] in Notion provides four distinct views to help users track and analyze their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These views are fed by an "expense details" database where all transaction information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The four main views are:
*   Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Summary of Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

## Expenses Overview

This view breaks down expenses by category, offering a snapshot of financial performance against a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each expense category, such as "shopping," "entertainment," "food expenses," and "utilities," it displays:
*   The total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   The budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   The percentage of the total budgeted amount that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or remains under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## Monthly Overview

The monthly overview presents all recorded expenses in a month-by-month format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Months are categorized, allowing for a quick glance at all expenses for any given month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Clicking on a specific month (period) will open a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, along with details of the amount and whether it was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Yearly Overview

Similar to the monthly view, the yearly overview presents the same financial information but in a year-long format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It shows budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expenses as a percentage of budget, and the budget status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It also lists all transactions for the entire year, indicating the amount and whether each entry was a budget or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Summary of Expenses

This section provides a complete overview of all expenses in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to give a holistic view of financial performance throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Expense Details Database and Data Entry

All these views are populated by data entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database is organized by months, sorted in descending order so the most recent month appears at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

When entering a transaction:
1.  **Date:** The date of the expense is recorded, which automatically assigns it to the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  **Expense Detail:** A description of the expense, e.g., "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Period:** The specific month and year (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
4.  **Year:** The specific year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
5.  **Category:** The type of expense (e.g., "utilities," "food," "shopping," "entertainment"). Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
6.  **Expense Code:** Used to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
7.  **Expense Amount:** The actual cost incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
8.  **Budget Amount:** Used to set a budget for a specific expense at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When setting a budget, the expense name and category name are typically kept the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

As expense information is added, all the overview sections automatically update, providing real-time insights into financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This allows users to track how their month is progressing and understand their finances in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Further Analysis

Beyond the main views, users can click on specific `Period`, `Year`, or `Category` entries within the database to reveal more granular details:
*   **By Period (Month):** Shows all transactions for that specific month, including amounts and whether they were budgeted or actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **By Year:** Provides a similar detailed view for the entire year, summarizing budgeted amounts, actual expenses, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **By Category:** Displays how much expense has been booked for a particular category, showing expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, status, and related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **By Expense Code:** Allows tracking of amounts booked for a specific expense category within a particular month against its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

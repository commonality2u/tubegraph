The personal finance tracker spreadsheet includes a transactions tab, which is crucial for [[tracking income and expenses | tracking income and expenses]] and recording detailed financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This tab is one of three main sections in the spreadsheet, alongside the dashboard and budget tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Prerequisites: Budget Tab Setup
Before utilizing the transactions tab, it's necessary to first navigate to the [[navigating_the_budget_tab_for_income_and_expense_details | budget tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Here, you must input details for all income and expense-related accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. You also need to specify a budgeted amount for each month, whether for expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The "goal amount" column in the budget tab is formula-driven, totaling the monthly figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. When adding new line items, this formula needs to be dragged down to copy it to new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. New rows can be added by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Entering Transactions in the Transactions Tab
Once accounts and budget estimations are established in the budget tab, you can add new transactions to the transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This tab allows you to record specific details for each financial activity, facilitating [[tracking transactions and expenses | tracking transactions and expenses]] and overall cash flow.

Fields to populate include:
*   **Date**: The date the transaction occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Details of the Transaction**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Category**: This dropdown specifies the account related to the transaction, drawing from the accounts previously set up in the budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Income/Expense**: This column (column E) is formula-driven and automatically indicates whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. When adding new line items, simply drag the formula down to populate this column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Next Steps: Dashboard Analysis
After all relevant transactions are entered into the transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, the next step is to navigate to the dashboard section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The dashboard provides an analysis of all recorded income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You can filter the view by category, period, or type of reference to see a summary of total income, total expenses, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It also offers income and expense overviews, a monthly personal finance overview, and a status check indicating whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

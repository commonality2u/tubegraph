The Sales Performance OS template allows for comprehensive management and customization of sales targets and unique sales codes across different aspects of your sales operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Setting Sales Targets

Sales targets can be set for:
*   **Salespersons**: At the start of each month, a sales target can be assigned to individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This represents the assigned sales goal for that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A "Sales Target" quick action button is available to automatically assign a target for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Sales Channels**: You can set targeted sales for each individual sales channel (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Sales Locations**: Similarly, targeted sales can be specified for each individual sales location at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Once targets are set, as sales are made throughout the month, the actual sales amount and sales units can be entered into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The system then displays the percentage of the targeted sales achieved and whether the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, while "Target not achieved" is shown otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Defining Sales Codes

Unique sales codes are used to identify specific entities within the sales data:
*   **Salesperson Codes**: Each individual making a sale can have a specific sales code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For example, "jcore_december23" might represent James Carter's sales for December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Codes (Referral Codes)**: A unique referral code can be assigned to each sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Tags**: A unique tag relevant to the location can be specified for each sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This tag typically includes the location name, month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

These codes are crucial for tracking and filtering sales data accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Customization Options

The dashboard is entirely customizable to your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: You can instantly edit details like salesperson names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, month names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, and client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This can be done by clicking on the detail to open a new window for modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization**: The currency of the entire dashboard can be changed to your preferred currency by modifying the currency sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. You can also update the currency format for all amount properties by clicking on "edit property" and then "number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Filtering**: The dashboard allows for filtering data by specific years or months to analyze sales performance in more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. You can add filters for "year" or "month" to narrow down the displayed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

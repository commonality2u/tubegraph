A sales receipts tracker in Notion allows businesses to keep detailed records of their sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template helps organize key information related to each sale, providing a comprehensive overview of business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Sales Receipts Database

The core of the tracker is the sales receipts database, which contains all necessary information for tracking sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Key columns include:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method:** Users can select from several predefined methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Business Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and **Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Customer Details:** This is a relational property linked to another database containing client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Description:** For details of what was sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Quantity of Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

Individual sales rows can include multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices for different items sold within a single receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For example, a single row might show two distinct items sold with their respective quantities and unit prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Calculation Columns
*   **Subtotal:** This column sums the total amount of all individual items listed in the descriptions for that sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate:** Allows for the application of tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Total Amount:** Automatically computed based on subtotal and tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Notes:** A column for any relevant notes regarding the payment or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Formula Updates
> If additional columns are added for descriptions or quantities, users must update the formulas for the subtotal amount to ensure accurate computation of the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Similarly, the "quantity sold" column, which sums `quantity one` and `quantity two`, needs to be updated if more quantity columns are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Sales Receipt Summary

Located at the top of the tracker, the sales receipt summary provides key performance indicators for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:
*   **Total Sales:** This value is derived directly from the sales values in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Units Sold:** Represents the total quantity of sales from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Average Sales Value:** Calculated by dividing the total sales by the units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This provides crucial information on the overall sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Client Summary

The client summary section displays sales metrics broken down by individual clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:
*   **Total Sales for each client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   **Total Quantity of sales made to each client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   **Average Sales Price for every client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>

This section is customizable to fit specific reporting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This template for [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income and expenses]] can also be related to [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker_in_notion | tracking customer payments]]. While not explicitly stated, this sales tracker could be a component of a larger [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal finance tracker]] or a business's overall [[creating_an_income_tracker_in_notion | income tracker]].

## Customization and Support

The template can be customized further based on individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Generating Sales Receipt PDFs (External Tool)

While the Notion template is used for tracking, an external tool, `PDFoutput.com`, can be utilized to generate PDF documents for sales receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Process for PDF Generation
1.  **Access the tool:** Navigate to `PDFoutput.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Select Template:** Choose the "sales receipts" template from the template selection dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
3.  **Fill Information:** Input all required sales information, such as receipt number, date, payment method, business details, item descriptions, quantities, unit prices, tax rate, and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This mirrors the data points in the Notion tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
4.  **Currency Selection:** Users can select their preferred currency (e.g., US Dollars, Euro) which will automatically update in the generated PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
5.  **Download PDF:** Click "Download PDF" to generate and obtain the individual sales receipt document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Bulk PDF Export Mode
For generating multiple sales receipts at once, the "bulk export mode" can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
1.  **Database Input:** Input all sales receipt details into a database format within the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
2.  **Adjust Layout:** Column widths and row heights can be adjusted for better readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. New rows can be added, and existing rows or items can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
3.  **Download All PDFs:** Clicking "Download all PDF" will generate and download all the receipts as separate PDF files in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Alternatively, individual PDFs can be downloaded by clicking on specific rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The tool also allows users to request new templates or send feedback via dedicated functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For queries regarding the PDF output tool, contact can be made at `notionformyuse@gmail.com` or via the feedback window on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

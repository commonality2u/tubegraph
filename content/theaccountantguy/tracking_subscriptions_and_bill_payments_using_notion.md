This Notion setup helps users track their personal finances, including managing subscriptions and bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The overall tracker features sections for net worth targets, accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities), a summary view, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, net worth, and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts for Bills and Subscriptions

To begin tracking bills and subscriptions, first navigate to the "Account" section within the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Under the "Expenses" category, you can specify your bills and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
To add a new bill or subscription expense, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
1.  **Name**: Type the name of the expense (e.g., "Wi-Fi bills", "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
2.  **Opening Balance**: For expenses, there is no opening balance, so this can be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
3.  **Classification**: Set the classification as either "Bills" or "Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
4.  **Payment Frequency**: Select how often the payment is expected (e.g., "Monthly", "Annually", "Quarterly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

### Modifying Existing Accounts
To modify an existing bill or subscription, click the "edit" button (pencil icon) next to the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Entering Transactions for Bills and Subscriptions

After setting up the accounts, navigate to the "Expense" section under "Transactions" to enter payment details for bills and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

To add a new transaction:
1.  **Date**: Select the date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
2.  **Description**: Add a description (e.g., "Amazon subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
3.  **Account**: Choose the specific bill or subscription account (e.g., "Wi-Fi bill," "Netflix," "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
4.  **Payment Mode**: Select the method of payment (e.g., "Bank," "Cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
5.  **Transaction Type**: Set this to "Outflow" as money is leaving your account for an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
6.  **Amount**: Enter the amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## Tracking Bills in the Summary Section

After entering transactions, you can track them in the [[creating_a_bills_tracker_in_notion | Bills Tracker in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Navigate to the "Bills" section under the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. This view categorizes bills into two payment statuses: "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

*   **Upcoming Payments**: These are bills whose next payment due date is *after* the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. For example, if a utility bill's last payment was August 17th and its frequency is monthly, the next expected payment will show as September 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: These indicate bills where the last recorded payment is *before* the expected next payment date, suggesting a missed or pending payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. For instance, if groceries are paid weekly and the last payment was August 20th, it will show in "Past Payments" until a new transaction is entered for the subsequent week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

The view displays the total amount paid so far for each bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This allows for quick insights into payment statuses and acts as a reminder for upcoming [[using_notion_for_bill_reminders | bill reminders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

## Tracking Subscriptions in the Summary Section

The "Subscription" section under the "Summary" view helps track [[tracking_subscription_expenses_in_notion | subscription expenses in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Similar to bills, it has "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows subscriptions with a next due date beyond the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Lists subscriptions where the last payment date is past the expected next payment date based on its frequency, indicating a potential missed payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

Each subscription entry also shows its "Subscription Status" (e.g., "Active") and the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. If the status is not visible for a newly added account, it can be enabled by clicking the pencil icon and selecting "Subscription status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

## Viewing Specific Account Transactions

To quickly view all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., a specific bill or subscription), navigate to the "Finances" section in the "Summary" view. Click on the account name (e.g., "Salary" or "Side Hustle"), and a "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom of the right-side window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. Clicking this will automatically populate and display all transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This provides a focused overview without sifting through all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

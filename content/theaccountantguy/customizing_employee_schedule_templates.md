The employee schedule template is a tool designed to help organizations keep track of all employee schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template is fully [[setting_up_an_employee_schedule_template | customizable]] to fit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

It features four primary views for comprehensive management:
*   **Employee Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Task Schedule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Monthly View** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Employee Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

## Employee Details
This section is used for [[managing_employee_details_and_tasks | managing employee details]] and is the starting point for setting up your schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

You can perform the following actions:

Further details like department, position, and email ID can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A "quick action" button at the top can also be used to automatically add an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Customizing Categories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>: Pre-set categories such as operations, marketing, and finance are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. You can add new categories by clicking the plus icon or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Task Schedule
After employee details are entered, the [[managing_employee_details_and_tasks | task schedule]] section allows for inputting task-related information for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Shift Management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>: Tasks are organized into different shifts (e.g., first, second, third shift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Time and Task Entry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>: Users can enter start and end times, including specific dates, and then add detailed task information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Employee Assignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>: Employees can be assigned to tasks by selecting their name from the list populated from the Employee Details section, or by adding a new employee directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Automatic Department Assignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>: Once an employee is selected, their respective department, as set in the employee details, automatically populates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Monthly View
This view offers an overview of performance, showing months divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

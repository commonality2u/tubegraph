This article demonstrates how to utilize a [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | debt payment tracker]] in Notion to manage and pay off debts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your debts, track payments, and calculate progress towards becoming debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This system is part of a broader approach to [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | using Notion for financial tracking]] and [[using_notion_for_financial_planning_and_debt_overview | financial planning]].

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debts into different payment frequencies, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It includes several key columns for each debt:

*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount:** The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment:** The first installment payment date for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A calculated date indicating when you will be debt-free if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs:** Shows how many installments need to be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Customizing Payment Categories

You can add new debt categories by clicking the "add a group" button and specifying a new installment period, such as "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system already includes common payment schedules like annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Moving Debts Between Categories

Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules by dragging the line item to the desired category (e.g., from monthly to quarterly), which will automatically update the repayment schedule and other relevant calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress Section

This section provides a summary of all loans and their repayment progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It includes:

*   **Total Amount Repaid:** Automatically updated based on recorded EMI payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage:** Shows the percentage of total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount:** The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount:** The total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

All amounts paid towards debt are split into interest and principal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debts

*   **Quickly Add a New Debt:** Click the "added details" button to add a new debt to the "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once added, you can select its payment frequency and input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Edit Existing Loan Details:** Click on the debt field to type in changes, which will automatically update across all related columns and sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Transaction Section (Installment Section)

This section is where you can view and record all debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section

This part reflects all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Key columns in the transaction section include:

*   **Paid Column:** A checkbox that, when ticked, updates the payment status and reflects the payment in the "paid installment" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details:** Allows you to select the specific loan associated with the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   **Next Repayment Schedule:** Automatically calculated based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, if a student loan is set for monthly payments and paid on September 30, the next payment will be October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. For an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, the next repayment will be September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Adding New Debt Payments

Clicking the "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. You can then input the details and description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Automatic Updates

All sections, especially the "Debt Payoff Progress," update automatically as you add or modify payment details in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. For instance, if you change an EMI amount for a student loan from $2,000 to $3,000, the total amount repaid and other calculations in the progress section will immediately reflect the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

This [[using_notion_for_debt_management_and_tracking_debt_payments | Notion debt tracking system]] helps you visualize and manage your debt repayment journey effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Similar principles can be applied to [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | tracking invoice payments]] or [[using_notion_for_accounts_receivable_and_payable_tracking | accounts receivable and payable tracking]] within Notion, making it a versatile tool for [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracking]].

This article outlines how to utilize an [[setting_up_an_employee_schedule_template | employee schedule template]] to keep track of schedules and performance for employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template offers four primary views: Employee Details, Task Schedule, Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Employee Details

The Employee Details section lists information for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Adding New Employees and Categories
To [[adding_new_employees_and_categories | add a new employee]], click on "new" and input their details under relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Categories:** The template comes with default categories like Operations, Marketing, and Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. New categories can be added by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and existing ones can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Employee Information:** When adding a new employee, you can enter their name, employee ID, and contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Further details like department, position, contact, and email ID can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button:** An "add employee" quick action button on the top automatically adds a new employee entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Task Schedule

After employee details are added, the Task Schedule section allows for entering [[assigning_tasks_and_deadlines_in_a_business_plan | task-related information]] for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Shifts:** Tasks are organized into different shifts, such as First, Second, and Third Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Task Entry:** For each shift, employees can enter details including:
    *   **Start and End Time:** Users can input the desired date and time, along with the period it belongs to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Task Detail:** Information related to the task can be added here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Employee Assignment:** Select the employee name for the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Department:** The respective department for the assigned employee will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **Hours Worked:** The hours worked on a specific task are automatically computed based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   **Attendance:** Employees can mark their attendance as present, on leave, or day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Task Status:** The status of a task can be updated to In Progress, Completed, Not Started, or Not Applicable (e.g., for day off or leave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Monthly View

The Monthly View provides an overview of [[tracking_monthly_performance_and_hours | monthly performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Division:** Months are divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hour Tracking:** This view shows:
    *   Total hours worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   Total hours on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Total hours (sum of working and leave hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
This gives a quick overview of overall monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Employee Performance

For individual employee performance insights, the Employee Performance section displays the same information as the Monthly View, but broken down by each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Individual Metrics:** For every employee, you can see their hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This system allows for comprehensive [[tracking_monthly_performance_and_hours | tracking of employee work]] and scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The template is fully [[customizing_employee_schedule_templates | customizable]] to specific organizational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

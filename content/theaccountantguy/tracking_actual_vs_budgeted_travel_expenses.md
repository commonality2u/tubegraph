The travel expense tracker is designed to help users [[tracking_expenses | keep track of all travel expenses]] and plan for future trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It provides a comprehensive view of expenditures against set budgets, enabling users to monitor their financial performance for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Tracker Sections

The tracker is organized into key sections for easy navigation and detailed financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Summary:** Provides an overall glance at accounts, expenses, and a high-level summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Accounts:** Where different expense categories are defined and budgeted amounts are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** Shows the total expenses incurred, the budgeted amount for each, and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts and Budgeted Expenses

The initial step involves setting up the various expenses in the 'accounts' view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Classifying Expenses
Expenses are [[classifying_travel_expenses_into_categories | classified under predefined categories]] such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. All subsequent expenses incurred will be booked under one of these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources
To add a new expense source:
1.  Click on "add expense source" within a category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This automatically adds a new entry to the selected category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon next to the newly added source to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  Rename the expense (e.g., "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
4.  Set a [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | budgeted amount]] for this expense source (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Expense sources can also be moved between categories by clicking the three dots next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Adding New Categories
If additional categories beyond Travel, Meals, and Lodging are needed, users can click the plus sign on the right side to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Tracking Actual Expenses vs. Budget

The "Expenses" section provides a detailed view of [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget vs actual expense tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For each expense source, it displays:
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Budgeted expense set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Visual Cues for Performance
The tracker uses color coding to indicate performance against budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>:
*   **Red:** Indicates that actual expenses have exceeded the budgeted amount (e.g., $2,000 spent on a flight with a $1,000 budget, showing 200% utilization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Green:** Indicates that actual expenses are within or below the budgeted amount (e.g., $100 spent on breakfast with a $300 budget, showing 33% utilization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

This [[budget_versus_actual_expense_analysis | budget versus actual expense analysis]] allows for a quick assessment of spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The "Summary" section offers a complete overview of all travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   An overall percentage reflecting total expenses divided by total budgeted expenses (e.g., 59% spent of the total budgeted amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

New expenses are added directly under the classified categories (Travel, Meals, Lodging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
1.  Click on the relevant quick addition button, such as "add travel expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This automatically adds a new expense entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  Add a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
3.  Input "trip info," which can be modified by clicking the three dots next to it (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  Select the specific account for the expense, such as 'Train' under 'Travel' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it [[dynamic_updates_of_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | dynamically updates the corresponding expense summary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If no budgeted expense was initially set for that category, it will automatically reflect the appropriate values once a budget is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. For example, a $100 train expense with a $200 budget will show 50% utilization in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This system facilitates [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | tracking expenses against budget]] and provides clarity on spending, aiding in effective financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

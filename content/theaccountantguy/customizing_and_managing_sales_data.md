The Sales Performance OS template provides a comprehensive system for managing and tracking sales data, including performance metrics by salesperson, sales channel, and sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Components

The top section of the sales dashboard features three main components, all divided by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

1.  **Salesperson Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
    *   Shows monthly sales made by each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Displays four key statistics: achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of targeted sales achieved, and target status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the targeted amount, while "Target not achieved" is shown if sales are below target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  **Sales Channel Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   Identifies sales sources (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Allows users to add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   Presents achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage, and status similar to salesperson data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
3.  **Sales Location Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   Tracks sales made to different geographical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Includes the same performance characteristics as the other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Sales Overviews

On the left side of the dashboard, detailed overviews provide insights into total sales, sale units, and average sales:

*   **Salesperson Overview**: Shows total sales, sale units, and average sales per individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview**: Displays the same metrics for each sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview**: Provides total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These overviews help track overall business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> and can be viewed as per different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Managing Sales Transactions and Targets

Below the main dashboard, users can add and manage sales transactions:

*   **Sales Transactions**: This window is similar to the sales dashboard, allowing entry of transaction details like date, account details (salesperson), sales details (what was sold), month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Detail**: Users can feed in salesperson information, client details (to whom the sale was made), and a unique sales code for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Setting Sales Targets**: At the beginning of each month, users can set sales targets for individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. As sales are made, the sales amount and units can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Buttons**:
    *   A "Sales Target" quick action button automatically assigns targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Targets can also be set for sales channels and locations at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   An "Add Transaction" button allows for entering new sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Automated Updates**: Once details are entered in the salesperson window, the specific channel, referral code, and target information are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Account details for sales channels and locations also need to be entered as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Customization and Flexibility

The Sales Performance OS is highly customizable:

*   **Editing Information**: Users can instantly add new salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> or edit existing details like names (e.g., changing "James Carter" to "Emily Watson") directly from the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Cover Images**: Users can set custom cover images for individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Month and Year Management**: The ability to create new months and manage years is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Client Details**: Client names can be entered, and further information like address, city, and state can be managed in a dedicated client dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization**: The currency of the entire dashboard can be changed from dollar to any preferred currency by modifying the currency sign or the number format property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Filtering and Data Analysis

[[using_filters_and_customizations_in_sales_dashboards | Filters]] allow for detailed analysis of sales performance:

*   **Yearly Filtration**: Users can filter data to see performance for a specific year by adding a "year" filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Monthly Filtration**: Similarly, data can be filtered by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Combined Filters**: Combinations of month and year filters can be used (e.g., all months of a particular year) to view more specific details of sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

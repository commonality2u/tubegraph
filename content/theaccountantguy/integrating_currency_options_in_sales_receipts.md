## Overview of Sales Receipts Tracker

A sales receipts tracker template allows users to keep track of sales effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template includes a [[setting_up_a_sales_receipts_database | sales receipts database]] with essential information such as receipt number, date, payment method, business name and address, customer details, description of items sold, quantity, and unit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The database can handle multiple items per sale, summing individual item amounts into a subtotal column before applying tax rates to compute the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The tracker also provides a sales receipt summary displaying total sales, units sold, and average sales value, offering key performance indicators for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Additionally, a client summary shows total sales, quantity of sales, and average sales price per client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Generating Sales Receipt PDF Documents

Beyond the Notion template, tools like PDF output.com can be utilized to [[generating_pdf_documents_for_sales_receipts | generate sales receipts PDF documents]] for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Individual Receipt Generation and [[currency_settings_and_customization_in_notion | Currency Options]]

On PDF output.com, users can select a sales receipt template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. After filling in details such as receipt number, date, payment method, business information, and item specifics (description, quantity, unit price, tax rate), users can select a currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Currently, the default currency is set to US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, users can choose other currencies, such as Euro, and the system will automatically update the currency displayed on the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Once all information is entered and the currency is selected, clicking "download PDF" generates the sales receipt document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### [[exporting_and_customizing_invoices_in_bulk | Bulk Export Mode]] and Currency Customization

For generating multiple PDF documents simultaneously, PDF output.com offers a bulk export mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Users can input all sales receipt information in a database format within the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Column widths and row heights are adjustable for better readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

In this mode, users can download all PDFs in one go or select individual rows to download specific receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. If the currency is changed within the bulk export interface, it will automatically populate and apply to all generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The Notion budget tracker template is designed to help fulfill diverse budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It offers various options for [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | customization]] to align with individual financial tracking requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Template Components and Budget Setting

The template includes five core components: income, expense, debt, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### Setting Goals and Budgets
*   **Income**: A "goal amount" can be set for each income component for every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. The template displays the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>.
*   **Expense**: Users can set a "budget amount" for expenses, which automatically updates as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. It also shows the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
*   **Budget Status**: A "budget status" feature indicates whether expenses are within or beyond the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.

## Data Input and Category Customization

Transactions are entered in a dedicated section with quick buttons for different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:55">[02:10:55]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Categories
Users can add as many categories as they choose for each component (e.g., salary, side hustle for income; food, entertainment for expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>. Existing categories can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:58">[03:11:58]</a>. The template updates automatically based on the selected categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>.

### Customizing Date Inputs
When entering income or expense details, users can input the specific month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>. If a different year is needed, users can simply type it in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:59">[02:51:59]</a>. The template automatically takes the input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering and Views

The template provides dynamic filtering options to view data for specific periods.
*   **Filtering by Year**: Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year by adding a filter for the "Year" property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:07">[07:20:07]</a>.
*   **Filtering by Month**: Similarly, data can be filtered for a specific month, showing values across all years for that month, or for a specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:07">[07:39:07]</a>.

## Currency Customization

The currency displayed in the template, initially set to dollars, can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:36">[06:03:36]</a>.
*   To change the currency, click on any number value, select "Edit property," then "Number format," and choose from the wide range of currencies Notion provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:55">[06:06:55]</a>.

## Funds Balance Overview

The template includes a "funds balance" section that shows monthly income, spendings, and the remaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:01">[08:23:01]</a>. This section automatically updates as income and expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

The [[tracking_subscriptions_and_bill_payments_using_notion | subscription expenses tracker]] in Notion provides an overview section that displays all subscriptions at a quick glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Within the categories view, subscriptions are primarily divided into "active" and "cancel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Each category lists the subscription's name, total expenses incurred, and billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Expense Classification

Beyond the active/cancel status, the expenses section further [[creating_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | categorizes subscriptions]] into different groups, such as "infotainment," "education," and "music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For each classification, you can see the subscription's name, total expenses, and its percentage contribution to the overall [[tracking_subscription_expenses_in_notion | total subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Creating and Editing Groups

You can [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | add new expense groups]] or edit existing ones:
*   **Add a new group**: Click the plus (+) icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Edit an existing group**: Click on the group and change its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Adding and Moving Subscriptions to Categories

When you [[adding_and_editing_subscriptions_in_notion | add a new subscription]] using the "add subscription" quick action button, it initially appears under a "new subscription" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. You can then move it to an appropriate classification:
*   Click the three dots next to the newly added subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Select the desired classification, such as "active mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Use the pencil icon to [[adding_and_editing_subscriptions_in_notion | edit the subscription details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Managing Subscription Status

The transaction section allows you to manage the status of your subscriptions.
*   **Active Subscriptions**: A checkbox indicates if a subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This view shows all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Canceled Subscriptions**: By unchecking the status box, the subscription automatically moves to the "cancel" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This is reflected in the [[viewing_and_canceling_subscriptions_in_notion | canceled subscription view]] and the overview section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

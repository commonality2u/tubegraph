[[notion_overview | Notion]] templates can be used to organize various aspects of life, including home inventory. One example is the Home Inventory Tracker template, designed to keep all home inventory information in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Home Inventory Tracker

This template provides a comprehensive overview and detailed tracking functionalities:

### Summary Dashboard
The left side of the template provides a summary of purchases:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

### Detailed Sections
The right side of the template is divided into three main sections:

#### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up different inventory categories, such as "Dairy and Eggs," "Medicines," and "Fruits and Veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Under each category, subcategories are listed along with their estimated budgeted purchase amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

#### Inventory Overview
The inventory overview provides key metrics for all subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

#### Transaction Section
This section is used to specify and track inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can record purchases, such as "cheese purchase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, detailing:
*   Subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Inventory items purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Amount of purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   When items are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
Users can add new entries and specify the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the various subsections, allowing users to track available inventory and consumption requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

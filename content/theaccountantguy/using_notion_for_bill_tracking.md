Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates a method for setting up bill payment reminders that deliver notifications directly to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system allows for the display of bill details, including the bill type (e.g., "Wi-Fi builds"), a due date (e.g., September 20), and the payment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting Up a Bill Payment Reminder

### Creating a New Bill Template
To [[creating_a_notion_bills_tracker|create a new bill payment reminder]], access a dropdown menu and choose "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can then input the bill's name, such as "Mobile bill," and specify the bill amount, for example, $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Setting Recurring Payments
Once a bill is created, navigate back to the dropdown menu, click on the three dots, and configure the bill to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, a mobile bill can be scheduled to recur "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can also specify the exact time they wish to receive the notification, such as 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

Setting up this bill tracking system requires the assistance of automation software like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation workflow is configured within Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide are provided when the automation template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once this automation is set up, users will consistently receive notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Receiving Notifications

After a template is set for recurring notifications, such as monthly, users will automatically start receiving these notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For instance, if a new bill is set to notify at 11:55 AM on September 20th, a notification will be received around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The system typically sends notifications within about a minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Notifications are received for every added bill and for every month they are set to recur through the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

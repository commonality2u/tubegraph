This article explains how to utilize a template designed to track emergency funds, providing an overview of its features for setting up funds, tracking contributions, and analyzing savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template features a summary section at the top that reflects three key areas:
*   **Fund Setup**: Where categories and individual funds are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview**: Provides a comprehensive look at all savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: Presents a collective view of all savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The fund setup allows users to organize their emergency savings into specific categories and define individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
The template comes with three predefined categories:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data= "00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

Users can [[customizing_emergency_fund_categories | customize these categories]] or add new ones by clicking on them or selecting "add a group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding New Funds
To add a new emergency fund, click the "add fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Newly added funds initially appear under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They can then be moved to the appropriate category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

For each fund, users can input:
*   **Fund Detail**: A specific description for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount available for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for that emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date when contributions to the fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The desired date by which the total emergency fund amount should be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the savings made to date once these details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Fund names can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Contribution Section

This section is where users record money contributed to each emergency savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Contributions are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top, along with a count of contributions made for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Each entry includes:
*   **Date**: The date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief note about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution, with predefined options for 2023 and the ability to add new months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Fund**: The specific emergency fund to which the contribution is made, selectable from the funds set up earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The actual amount of savings or contribution made for the specific month towards that fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: This column automatically displays the monthly contribution needed to reach the targeted goal amount by the set end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A checkmark appears if the amount contributed meets or exceeds the required amount for that month and fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

A "quick action" button can be used to automatically add a new line item for the current date and month, simplifying the entry process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The quarterly overview provides a quick, glanceable view of monthly contributions within each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It organizes months into Quarter 1 (January-March), Quarter 2 (April-June), Quarter 3 (July-September), and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

For each month, it displays:
*   Total savings made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The savings overview, accessible from the top summary section, categorizes savings by the three main classifications (e.g., Financial Safety) and lists individual emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

For each emergency fund, it shows:

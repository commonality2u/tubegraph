A small business bookkeeping template in Notion helps track all bookkeeping needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Template Sections

The template is divided into three main sections: "Start Here," "Summary," and "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Start Here Section

The "Start Here" section is where initial business information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

#### Account Setup

This section includes an "Account" area where different financial accounts are set up under heads like expenses, liabilities, income, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Examples of accounts include purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, salaries and wages under expenses; and accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, and credit card under liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

-   **Editing Accounts**

-   **Deleting Accounts**
    To delete an item, click the three-dot menu and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

    *   **Classification**: Classify the item (e.g., bills, debt, savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Expenses like utility bills might be classified as "bills," and subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency**: Select the payment frequency for recurring payments (e.g., monthly, half-yearly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units**: Enter the starting units for any inventory or assets when beginning the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

#### Inventory Tracking

Businesses can monitor inventory, including stock levels and profit or loss obtained from specific inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Summary Section

All transactions entered in the "Transactions" window automatically update in the "Summary" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

The net worth section shows the set net worth goal, the calculated total net worth (from assets, liabilities, and transactions), and the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The net worth goal can be set at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

#### Investment and Inventory Summary

The summary sections for investments and inventory show values, units held for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, and similar status for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

#### Overall Summary

An overall summary displays total income, total expenses, gross profit, taxes paid, and the net profit of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

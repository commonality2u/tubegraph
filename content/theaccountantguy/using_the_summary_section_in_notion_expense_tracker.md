The Notion expense tracker includes a dedicated summary section designed to provide an overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This section helps users [[using_notion_for_expense_tracking | track expenses]] and manage their budget, whether for personal or business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary Section Components

The summary section typically displays several key figures:

*   **Budgeted Expense Amount**: This figure represents the total amount allocated for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Users can set their own budgeted expense amounts by clicking on the budgeted expense amount within the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For example, if a total budget of $10,000 is set, this amount will appear in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount**: This figure shows the real-time amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The actual expenses are computed from the expense details entered into the main table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. As you enter amounts for individual expenses, the categories and the summary section automatically update with the respective expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Difference**: This indicates the variance between the budgeted expense and the actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Expense Spent**: This shows the proportion of the allocated budget that has already been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

All these figures in the summary section are automatically updated as new expenses are entered and budgeted amounts are adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This functionality allows users to [[tracking_expenses_and_income_in_notion | track expenses in one template]] and helps in [[using_notion_for_expense_management | managing expenses efficiently]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

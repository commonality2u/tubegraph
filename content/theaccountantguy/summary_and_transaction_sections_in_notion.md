This article explains how to [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | organize financial transactions in Notion]] using the Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker template, focusing on its summary and transaction sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool helps users [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | manage accounts and transactions in Notion]], specifically for tracking customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Accounts Receivable and Payable Account Section

At the top of the tracker, there's a section for receivable and payable accounts with four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Accounts View
The "Accounts" view allows users to set up customer and vendor details, including their opening balances and the number of due invoices against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New customers or vendors can be added quickly using dedicated action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. After adding details, users can input the opening balance (starting receivable or payable) and any pending invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Receivable and Payable Views
These sections reflect all receivable and payable accounts along with their transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, if two customer accounts (Sandra and Harry) are added, their details will appear here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Transaction Reflection**: Displays all transactions, such as invoices raised against customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Invoice Status**: Users can change the status of an invoice (e.g., from "Pending" to "Paid") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking**: A checkbox allows users to mark an invoice as "paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Marking an invoice as paid will remove that amount from the total outstanding balance displayed at the top for that specific customer or vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance**: For each customer, the outstanding amount is calculated and displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Summary Section

Below the individual account views, the summary section provides an [[overview_and_presentation_of_financial_data_in_notion | overall summary]] of all transactions carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It reflects the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This data is calculated from all the [[utilizing_the_transaction_and_profit_loss_sections_in_notion | transactions]] recorded in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is divided into three main segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This is where [[entering_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] are recorded in detail, which then automatically updates other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Receivable and Payable Segments
These segments are used for [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking transactions]] individually. Each entry includes:
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Period**: Users can select the quarter against which the transaction is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Account Name**: The specific customer or vendor account related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Invoice Number**: The corresponding invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Status**: The current status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Paid Status**: A checkbox to indicate if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. If checked, the amount will not be included in the total outstanding balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Quick action buttons are available to easily [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | add new receivable or payable entries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Entries are automatically bated by month, with newer months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A number indicates how many transactions occurred in each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The quarterly summary provides a consolidated view of all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. For example, if the third quarter has a total receivable of $1150 (summation of individual invoices) and a payable of $250, the net balance displayed would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The total amount across all quarters is also reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This provides a quick quarterly overview of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

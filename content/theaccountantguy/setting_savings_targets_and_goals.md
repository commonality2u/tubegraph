A savings funds tracker provides a comprehensive dashboard for [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | calculating and tracking savings goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It typically features two main views: the **Savings Target** and the **Savings Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tool is designed to help users set specific savings funds with their corresponding goal amounts and monitor their progress towards these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting and [[editing_and_managing_savings_funds | Managing Savings Funds]]

The **Savings Target** view is where you define individual savings funds and their desired goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds
To modify an already added saving fund:
1.  Click the pencil icon next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., changing "Savings Fund 1" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Adjust the goal amount as needed (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
Any changes made here will automatically update in the savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds
To create a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This will add a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon for the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and set your preferred goal amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds
If you wish to remove a saving fund:
1.  Click the six dots on the left side of the fund's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This will remove the fund from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Tracking Savings Progress

The **Savings Overview** provides a summary of your [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It shows the total amount saved, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Adding Savings Transactions
To add funds to a specific savings goal:
1.  Navigate to the **Transactions** panel at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  Click "Add Transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  You can adjust the date using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter a description for the saving (e.g., "Saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
5.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific fund from the dropdown list (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
6.  Enter the amount you are saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The system automatically updates the total savings for that fund and recalculates the percentage of the target amount achieved in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. For example, if a car fund had $1,400 saved and you add $1,000, the total will update to $2,400, reflecting the progress towards the $3,000 goal (80% achieved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Customization Options

### Currency Settings
The savings tracker supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To change the currency:
1.  Click on any amount displayed with the dollar currency symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired currency from the "Number Format" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Notion supports a wide range of currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Transaction Grouping
The transaction panel can be grouped by different timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>:
1.  Click the three dots in the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Under "Grouping," you can select to group transactions by:
    *   Month (default) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    *   Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
    *   Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
This allows for dynamic viewing of your savings progress over different periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This template is fully dynamic and customizable to suit individual [[budgeting_and_saving_with_notion | budgeting and saving with Notion]] requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

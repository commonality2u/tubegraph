This article details how to [[generating_boarding_pass_pdf_documents_using_notion | generate boarding pass PDF documents using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Components

To generate boarding pass PDF documents, two main Notion components are used:
*   **Boarding Pass Database** This [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] contains all the details for the boarding passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Boarding Pass Template** This template is used to generate the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Process for Generating PDF Documents

To generate the PDF documents from the database and template:

1.  **Input Name:** Type "boarding pass" into the connection details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database:** Select the "boarding pass database" to connect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Select Template:** Choose the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information:** The system will load all the information from the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
5.  **Export:** Once the information is loaded, click "export" to begin generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Output

After a successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, you can preview a sample to see that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Each generated PDF will have different names and contexts, corresponding to the entries in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

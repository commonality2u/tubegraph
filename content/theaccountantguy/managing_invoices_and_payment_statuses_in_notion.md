The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker in Notion is designed to help users track customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive system for managing invoices and payment statuses, offering various views and functionalities to maintain an organized financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Accounts View

This section, located at the top of the tracker, features four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The "Accounts" view allows users to set up customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Key features:
*   **Detail Setup** Users can input customer and vendor information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Opening Balances** Track the starting balance of receivables or payables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Due Invoices** Record the number of invoices pending against the opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Quick Actions** "Add vendor" and "Add customer" buttons are available for quickly creating new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. New entries can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Receivable Section

This view displays all receivable accounts and their associated details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows customer details and all transactions, including invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Features include:
*   **Invoice Status** The status of each invoice can be changed (e.g., paid, outstanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking** Users can mark an invoice as "paid" using a checkbox, which automatically updates the outstanding balance displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance** For each customer, the total outstanding amount is clearly reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Payable Section

Similar to the receivable section, the payable section provides details for each transaction with vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Information presented:
*   Date of invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   Amount raised against the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   A "paid" checkbox to update outstanding payable balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

This section offers an overall summary of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It reflects the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. These figures are calculated from the transactions recorded in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Receivable Transactions

In this segment, users can input details for each receivable transaction:
*   **Date and Period** Specify the date and select the relevant quarter (e.g., Q1, Q2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Description** Add a description for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Account Name** Link the transaction to a specific customer account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Amount and Invoice Details** Enter the amount and invoice number, along with the status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates** Once these details are entered, they automatically update relevant sections higher up in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Paid Status** A "paid" checkbox indicates if the amount has been paid, preventing it from being reflected in the total outstanding balances for the respective person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Buttons** "Add receivable entry" button automatically creates a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Payable Transactions

The payable transaction segment functions similarly to the receivable section, allowing users to input and track payable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. An "Add payable entry" button is available for quick additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary

This section provides an overview of all quarters combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it displays:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

This offers a clear quarterly overview of financial activity related to receivables and payables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

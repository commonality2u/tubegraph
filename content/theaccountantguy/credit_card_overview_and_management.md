The Notion-based credit card expenses tracker helps users monitor credit card payments and manage finances effectively [00:00:05].

## Overview Sections

The tracker provides several key overview sections:

### Credit Cards Overview
This section displays all added credit cards [00:00:10]. For each credit card, it shows:
*   The total amount due [00:00:23]
*   The amount repaid so far [00:00:25]
*   The remaining balance amount due [00:00:27]

For demonstration purposes, four credit cards were added: Student Credit Card, Cash Back Credit Card, Travel Credit Card, and Rewards Credit Card [00:00:18].

### Monthly Overview
This section provides a summary of amounts due, repaid, and the balance for each month [00:00:32]. It can be customized to individual requirements [00:00:37].

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, this section shows the total amount due, amount repaid, and the balance due for different years [00:00:41].

### Expense Detail Section
This section lists all expenses that have been added to the tracker [00:00:51]. It is the primary place for booking new transactions [00:01:37].

### [[Overview of expenses and budget tracking | Expenses Overview]]
This section offers a comprehensive overview of expenses categorized by [[Using categories for effective expense management | category]] [00:01:00]. It shows:
*   Total expenses added [00:01:05]
*   The budgeted amount for each category [00:01:06]
*   A comparison of expenses against the budgeted amount [00:01:08]
*   The budget status (under budget or over budget) [00:01:11]

Users can set their own budgeted amounts for each category, and the tracker will update the status accordingly [00:03:56]. An expense is "over budget" if it exceeds the set amount, and "under budget" if it falls within the budget [00:04:26].

### [[Budgeting and notifications in Notion for credit cards | Notification Section]]
This section serves as a reminder for upcoming repayments [00:01:16]. It shows the next repayment due date and the number of days remaining until that date for each added credit card [00:01:19]. Users can set the repayment date for each card [00:04:40].

## [[Credit card expenses tracking in Notion | Utilizing the Tracker]]

To start using the tracker, expenses must be booked under the "expense details overview section" [00:01:37].

### Booking Expenses
In the "expense details section," users can enter various information for each transaction:
*   **Date:** The date of the expense [00:01:42].
*   **Expense Details:** A description of the expense [00:01:44].
*   **Period:** The period for which the expense is booked (e.g., month) [00:01:46].
*   **Year:** The year of the expense [00:01:48].
*   **Credit Card:** The credit card used for the expense [00:01:51]. New credit cards can be added by typing them in [00:02:37].
*   **Category:** An assigned category for the expense [00:01:54].
*   **Expense Amount:** The monetary value of the expense [00:01:57].
*   **Repayment Section:** When repaying an amount for a credit card, the amount is entered here [00:02:00].
*   **Opening Balance Due:** Any balances carried forward from a previous month can be entered as an opening balance [00:02:07].

All entered details automatically update the overview sections [00:03:07]. For credit card repayments, users simply type "credit card repayment" in the details and enter the amount in the repayment column [00:02:58].

### Editing and Adding Credit Cards
Users can edit existing credit card information by clicking a pencil icon or add new credit cards via a "new" button [00:05:16]. When a credit card is selected, it shows all related transactions [00:06:26]. The status of each credit card can be changed, and custom categories can be added for specific cards [00:06:36].

### Adding and Managing Categories
Categories can be added by entering their details in the category section [00:05:24]. Clicking on any category will show all relevant expenses associated with that category [00:06:52].

## Additional Features and Views

### Receipt Column
The tracker includes a receipt column where users can attach bills or receipts for their expenses [00:05:34].

### Summarization Views
The tracker offers various summarization views for detailed insights:
*   **By Period:** Clicking on a specific period opens a new window showing transaction details such as date, period, description, amount, and a tag (e.g., "repayment" in green, "expense") [00:05:44].
*   **By Year:** Similar to the period view, this shows transaction information for a particular year [00:06:16].

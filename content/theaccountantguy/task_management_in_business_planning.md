This article explains how a [[utilizing_business_plan_templates | business plan template]] can be used for task management within business planning, specifically leveraging a [[creating_a_business_plan_in_notion | Notion]]-based system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

The template features two primary views: the [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | Business Plan Road Map]] and the [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

## Business Plan Road Map

The [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | Business Plan Road Map]] view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> The template provides 11 predefined stages, such as "Conceptional Research," "Planning and Structuring," and "Profitability and Scaling." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> These stages can be customized and edited as needed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

### Defining Objectives and Tasks

For each stage, objectives can be defined, and tasks are associated with these stages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> When clicking on a specific stage within the roadmap, a detailed view appears, displaying the tasks linked to that stage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

For each task, the following properties can be set:
*   **Deadline**: The date by which the task is expected to be completed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark a task as completed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   **Status**: A customizable status field to indicate the current state of the task (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

New tasks can be added to any stage by clicking a dedicated "new" icon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

### Progress Tracking

A key feature for [[organizing_tasks_with_notion_task_schedule | organizing tasks]] and tracking progress is the automatic completion percentage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> When a task's completion checkbox is marked, the overall completion percentage for that specific business plan stage automatically updates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the stage's completion percentage will show 50%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

Additionally, a documentation section at the bottom of each stage's view allows for detailed objectives and task descriptions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

## Events Timeline

The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] view presents all tasks and stages in a calendar or timeline format. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for tasks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   The overall timeline set for specific stages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   The stage name and associated tasks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   The date and status for each task. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

This view provides a quick overview of all planned activities and their respective timelines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> Clicking on any element within the timeline view navigates to the detailed information for that specific stage or task. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

An Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy, demonstrates how to use a template to [[tracking_contributions_and_progress_of_emergency_savings | track emergency funds]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The template includes a dedicated "summary section" and a "savings overview" to provide comprehensive insights into your emergency savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Overall Summary Section

The top-level "summary section" provides a high-level overview of your emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It reflects all savings made and the necessary contributions required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This section includes:
*   **Total Savings** This figure is the sum of the opening balance of all funds and the total contributions made through all entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required** This represents the summation of all targeted savings amounts you have set for your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference** The difference between your total savings and the total savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage** This indicates the percentage of your targeted savings amount that you have currently met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For example, if $10,350 has been saved out of a $40,000 target, it will show 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Savings Overview Section

The "savings overview" section categorizes savings into three classifications: financial safety, asset protection, and health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Within each category, individual emergency funds are listed with specific details:
*   **Total Savings** The current total amount saved for each specific fund, which is automatically calculated based on the starting balance and all contribution entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For instance, a Job Loss fund with a $500 starting balance and a $900 contribution will show $1,400 total savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings** The predetermined goal amount for each emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved** The percentage of the targeted savings that has been reached for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date** The specific end date by which you aim to have the total emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left** The number of months remaining until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This value updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month** The amount of contribution needed each month to meet the targeted fund goal by the specified end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Tracking Contributions and Meeting Targets

The template automatically calculates the savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In the [[tracking_contributions_and_progress_of_emergency_savings | contributions section]], contributions are divided by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For each month, you can input the date, description, period, selected fund, and the amount contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A "requirement" column indicates the monthly contribution needed to reach the goal by the target end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A tick or check mark appears when the required contribution for a specific fund for that month has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

A "quarterly overview" section provides a glanceable view of contributions across different months and quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This view shows total savings made and the requirement for each month within a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. For example, if $900 was saved for a fund with a $643 requirement, it indicates exceeding the requirement by 140% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Conversely, if $300 was saved against a $422 requirement, it shows 71% of the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Different colors are used to provide a quick visual snapshot of your financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The total savings for each quarter are also summarized at the top of this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. As you continue to add emergency savings funds, all values are automatically updated to provide a quick quarterly overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

This template is fully customizable to suit individual preferences and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

This article explains how to utilize a business plan template in [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion | Notion]] to streamline business planning, focusing on setting objectives and managing tasks. The template, presented by Anat Biswal (the accountant guy), offers structured views for clear oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Template Views

The business plan template features two primary views:
*   **Business Plan Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Events Timeline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Business Plan Roadmap

The "Business Plan Roadmap" view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In the demonstration, 11 stages are pre-defined, ranging from "Conception and Research" and "Planning and Structuring" to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can edit these stages to fit their specific needs by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Defining Objectives

For each stage, objectives can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
1.  Click on the right side of the template to access objective settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  Define the objectives for the specific business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  Specify which stage the objective corresponds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   *Example:* The "Planning and Structuring" stage might have an objective to "Blueprint Business Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Managing Tasks

Within each stage of the business plan roadmap, associated tasks are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Task Details**: Each task includes a deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Status**: A checkbox indicates if a task is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Task Status**: Users can assign a specific status to each task based on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Adding New Tasks**: New tasks can be added by clicking a "new icon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Documentation**: A documentation section at the bottom allows for detailed specification of objectives and tasks, providing more information about each stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Tracking Completion Percentage

A completion percentage is displayed for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. When tasks are marked as complete using the checkbox, this percentage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion shows as 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The "Events Timeline" view presents all discussed information in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It shows specific deadline dates, stage names, associated tasks, and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This view offers a quick timeline overview of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Clicking on arrows within the timeline will take the user to the specific date and show details of all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion | Notion]] template can be used to plan a business by clearly defining objectives and managing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

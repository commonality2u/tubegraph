This article discusses how to customize dashboard views and currency settings within Notion, specifically focusing on the Net Worth Tracker template developed by Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### Customizing Dashboard Views

Notion offers significant flexibility in changing how your financial data is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The template, for example, might initially display finances in a "Board view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

To change the dashboard's layout:
1.  Navigate to the finances view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
2.  Click on the "Layout" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
3.  Select an alternative view, such as "Gallery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This will instantly change how the information is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

You can also group items within the dashboard. For instance, you can group the finances by "Category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, which automatically organizes all assets, expenses, income, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The entire template is [[Customizing templates and databases in Notion | customizable]], allowing you to edit values and views whenever needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Customizing Currency Options

Notion supports changing the currency from the default dollar ($) to over 30 other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Detailed instructions on how to adjust the currency settings are available within the dashboard itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for [[Customizing Notion for Personal Budget Management | personal budget management]] and [[Adjusting currency settings in Notion for expense tracking | expense tracking]] in different regions.

### Compatibility

The Notion Net Worth Tracker supports all types of devices, including iOS, Mac, and various operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

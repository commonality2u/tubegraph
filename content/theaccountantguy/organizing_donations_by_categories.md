The [[charity_donation_tracking_using_notion | charity donation tracker]] is organized to help users manage contributions across different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The system provides a "Donation Funds Overview" at the top, divided into three main sections: "Fund Setup," "Donations Overview," and "Summary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Fund Setup: Categorizing Donations
The "Fund Setup" section is where the primary organization by category occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Pre-defined Categories**
    Donations are initially divided into three categories: Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   **Health:** Examples include American Red Cross, WHO, and Care funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   **Environment:** Examples include Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and The Rainforest Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   **Education:** Similarly, various education funds are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   **[[renaming_and_managing_categories | Customizing Categories]]**
    Users can [[renaming_and_managing_categories | edit existing categories]] by clicking on them and typing a new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. To add a new category, a slider at the bottom can be moved to the right, revealing a plus icon to create a new group/category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

*   **[[setting_up_and_managing_donation_funds | Setting Up Individual Funds]]**
    Beneath each category, specific funds are set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   **Adding Funds:** A new fund can be added by clicking the "add funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Initially, new funds are unclassified and can be moved to any existing category via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Fund Details:** Once placed, a fund's details can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes:
        *   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
        *   **Opening Balance:** Donations made to the fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
        *   **Targeted Donation:** The desired total donation for the specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
        *   **Start Date:** When donations for the fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
        *   **Target Date:** The end goal date for reaching the targeted donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Deleting Funds:** Existing funds can be deleted by clicking the three-dot menu next to them and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Donations Overview
This section allows users to see a specific, categorized view of donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. For each fund within a category (e.g., American Red Cross under Health), the following information is displayed:
*   Total Donation (including opening balance and subsequent contributions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   Target Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>
*   Percentage of targeted amount reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   Time remaining until the target date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>
*   Required monthly contribution to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>
Each specific category also displays a total contribution amount at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Summary
The [[summary_and_overview_of_donations_in_notion | summary]] section provides an overall view, aggregating data from all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It shows:

*   Total donations made so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>

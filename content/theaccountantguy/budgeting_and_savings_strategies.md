A personal finance tracker developed in Notion offers a comprehensive setup to manage finances, including dedicated sections for budgeting and savings. This system allows users to specify financial targets, track accounts, and get a summary view of their financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Budgeting

The tracker includes a dedicated budget section within the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This section outlines all expenses and income, showing the total incurred amounts and their percentage relative to the set budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Setting and Managing Budget Targets

To set or adjust budget amounts:
1.  Navigate to the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
2.  Click on "Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
3.  Click on the existing budget amount for an expense or income item and enter a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
4.  The system automatically updates and reflects these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

If the "budgeted amount" property is not visible, it can be unhidden by clicking on "31 more properties" and searching for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Savings Strategies

The personal finance tracker also features a savings section to help users track their savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Setting Up Savings Funds

To set up a specific fund for savings:
1.  Go to the "account section" under the "get started view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
2.  Savings accounts are considered "assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
3.  Click the "new" button to add a new saving account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
4.  Give the fund a name (e.g., "Car Fund") and classify it as "savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. An opening balance and payment frequency are typically not needed for savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
5.  To set a goal amount for the fund, click "edit" on the fund's entry in the accounts section and specify the "goal amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
6.  The system will then display the goal amount, the total amount saved so far, and the savings as a percentage of the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

### Adding Savings Transactions

2.  Click "new" and fill in the details:

    *   **Payment Mode:** Select how the money is being transferred (e.g., "Bank") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
    *   **Transaction Type:** For savings, this is an "outflow" transaction as money moves from a regular account to the savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
    *   **Amount:** Enter the amount saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
3.  Once added, the savings section will update to reflect the new total and percentage achieved towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## Personal Finance Tracking for Couples

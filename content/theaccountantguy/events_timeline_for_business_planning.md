The [[utilizing_business_plan_templates | business plan template]] offers two primary views: the [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan roadmap]] and the events timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This events timeline provides a visual overview of all planned activities related to your business.

## Overview
The events timeline displays all information discussed within the [[utilizing_business_plan_templates | business plan template]] in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It offers a quick timeline view of all planned items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Key Features
The timeline visually represents key information for each stage of your business plan:
*   **Specific Deadline Dates** The timeline reflects specific deadline dates, such as December 3 to December 20 for set timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Stage Information** For each stage, you can view the stage name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Associated Tasks** The timeline shows the [[task_management_in_business_planning | task]] associated with each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Dates and Status** It displays the relevant dates and the completion status for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Navigation and Detail
A "little arrow" on the timeline reflects dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, and all stages have specified dates and necessary properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Clicking on any of these arrows will direct you to the specific date and show detailed information for all stages along with their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

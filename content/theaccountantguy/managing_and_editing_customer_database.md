The customer section within the [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker | customer payments tracker]] template allows users to [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | set up and manage their entire customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Customer Sections

The customer section is organized into three default subsections:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

These subsections can be edited by clicking on them to start editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Additional subsections can be added by clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Under each of these sections, individual customers are listed as items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Managing Individual Customers

For each customer, the total payment amount that is due is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Users can perform several actions to manage customer details:
*   **Edit Due Amount**: The total payment amount due can be changed by clicking on the amount and entering a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Edit Customer Name**: Customer names can be edited by clicking a pencil icon next to the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Add New Customer**: New customer names can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Delete Customer**: Customers can be deleted by clicking on a three-dot icon and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Once the customer database, including payment amounts due, is set up, it contributes to the overview section of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Customer names from this database are also available for selection in the [[sales_transaction_entry_and_management | transaction section]] when [[adding_and_managing_transactions | entering transaction details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The Notion expense tracker is a customizable template designed to help manage all expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This template can be utilized for [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | personal expenses]] or [[using_notion_for_business_tracking | business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Key Features

### Customizable Categories
The tracker features a category section at the top, initially showing three distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each category is fully definable to suit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Renaming Categories**: Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon, allowing users to rename it as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After renaming, pressing enter saves the new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Editing or Deleting Categories**: To edit or delete a category, click on the three dots associated with it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by simply clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Expense Tracking
For every defined category, the tracker displays both a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Users can input expense amounts into a listed table at the bottom of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. As amounts are entered, all corresponding categories are automatically updated with the respective expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Budget Management
The "budgeted expense amount" for each category can be customized by clicking on it and setting the desired budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides an overview of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It includes:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The actual expenses amount, which is computed from the detailed expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Customization and Utility

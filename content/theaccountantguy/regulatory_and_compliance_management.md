The asset planner template includes a dedicated [[operational_management_for_assets | regulatory management section]] designed to help users manage compliance and related documentation for their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Compliance Section

This part of the template covers "everything related to compliance" concerning the assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is a key component within the broader [[operational_management_for_assets | regulatory management framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Documentation Section

Within the asset planner, a documentation section is available where users can add "all your relevant documents whatever is required related to the asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This feature is crucial for maintaining comprehensive records that may be necessary for regulatory adherence or auditing purposes.

## Asset Reviews

The template also includes a reviews section, allowing individuals to "put their own reviews about the assets that are being used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While not directly a compliance feature, such reviews can contribute to performance monitoring and quality control, which may indirectly support compliance goals or operational audits.

### Customization

The entire asset planner template, including its regulatory and compliance features, is "entirely customizable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Users can tailor it to suit their specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

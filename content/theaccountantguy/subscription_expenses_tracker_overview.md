The accountant guy, Sanat Biswal, demonstrates a Notion-based [[tracking_subscriptions_and_bills_using_notion | subscription expenses tracker]] designed to [[tracking_subscriptions_and_net_worth | track all your subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool aims to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed management of recurring subscription costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Subscription Overview Section

This section offers a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Categories
Subscriptions are categorized into "active" and "cancel" subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Subscription Details
Under each category, you can find the:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Billing period, which can be easily changed from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

## Expenses Section

This area divides subscriptions into different expense sections, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Groups and Classification
*   Users can add new expense groups by clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Existing groups can be edited by changing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Within each classification, details include the subscription name, total expenses, and the percentage each subscription contributes to the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Quick Action Button
A "quick action" button allows users to "add subscription," which automatically creates a new entry under a "note subscription" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This new entry can then be moved to the appropriate classification (e.g., active) and its details edited via a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section is where all subscription expenses are recorded and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Views
*   **Active Subscriptions View**: Shows all currently active subscriptions and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Cancelled Subscriptions View**: Displays subscriptions that have been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Monthly Breakdown**: Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top, along with the total sum of expenses incurred for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Entering Transaction Details
To [[tracking_and_booking_subscription_transactions | book the expenses for subscription]]:
*   Set the status as active using a checkbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Select the subscription account from a dropdown list populated from previously added subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   The billing period is automatically pulled from the subscription's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Enter the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period will show an October 30 renewal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

A dedicated template assists small businesses in [[tracking_inventory_transactions|tracking inventory]] and managing financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template includes a comprehensive [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|transaction section]] that facilitates recording purchases and sales, as well as calculating profit and loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Transaction Section Overview

The [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|transaction section]] is designed to provide insight into inventory movement and financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It consists of three primary views:
*   Purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
*   [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|Profit and Loss]] for inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>

## Recording Purchases

The purchases view helps in [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|recording inventory purchases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Date Organization**: Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Dates are also indicated if they fall within the last 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Transaction Details**: For each purchase, users can input:
    *   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    *   Account (the specific inventory item being purchased, e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
    *   Number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
    *   Purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
    *   The total amount is automatically populated based on units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status**: Users can assign an inventory status to each transaction, such as "in transit" or "received" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These statuses are editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button**: A "buy inventory" button automatically adds a new purchase transaction to the current date, streamlining the entry process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Recording Sales

The sales view allows users to [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|record any sales of inventory]] that have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The functionality is similar to the purchases section, enabling comprehensive tracking of inventory outflow.

## Profit and Loss Calculation

The [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|profit/loss section]] is crucial for understanding the financial performance of inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Input Requirements**: To calculate profit or loss, users must input the purchase price or manufacturing cost associated with each sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This applies to both raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Automatic Calculation**: Once the sales price and the corresponding cost are entered, the template automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, for 30 units, the profit would be ($40 - $10) * 30 units = $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

This integrated approach to [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss|transaction recording and profit/loss calculation]] helps businesses monitor inventory status and financial results effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

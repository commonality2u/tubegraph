The [[setting_up_employee_schedule_using_notion | employee schedule template]] in Notion is designed to track employee schedules within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template includes four main views: Employee Details, [[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | Task Schedule]], Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Template Sections

### Employee Details
This section lists all employees along with their relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

*   **Adding Employees**: New employees can be added by clicking "new" and entering details under relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Categories/Departments**: Predefined categories include operations, marketing, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add new categories using the plus icon or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Employee Information**: When adding a new employee, details such as name, employee ID, contact information, department, position, and email ID can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button**: An "add employee" button is available at the top for quick additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### [[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | Task Schedule]]
After employee details are added, the [[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | Task Schedule]] section allows for entering task-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

*   **Shift Organization**: Tasks are organized into different shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Task Entry**:
    *   **Start and End Times**: Users can enter desired dates and times for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Task Details**: Specific task information can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Employee Assignment**: Employees can be selected from those added earlier, or new employees can be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Department Auto-Assignment**: Once an employee is assigned, their respective department, set in the Employee Details, is automatically populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Hours Computation**: The template automatically calculates the hours worked on a specific task based on the entered start and end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Attendance and Task Status**:
    *   **Attendance**: Employees can mark their attendance as present, on leave, or day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Task Status**: Task progress can be updated to in progress, completed, or not started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For days off or leave, the task status can be marked as "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Monthly View
This view provides an overview of performance across different months, divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

*   **Performance Metrics**: It displays total hours worked, total hours on leave, and the summation of these two figures for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This offers a quick overview of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Employee Performance
For a more granular view, the Employee Performance section shows the same metrics individually for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

*   **Individual Metrics**: Users can see hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for each specific employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

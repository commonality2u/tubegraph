The Investment Portfolio tracker utilizes "quick action buttons" to streamline the process of adding and managing investments and their associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These buttons simplify data entry and ensure proper classification within the tracker.

## Adding New Investments

A dedicated "Add Investment" quick action button allows users to rapidly input new investment details into the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Process for Adding an Investment
1.  **Click the Button**: Clicking the "Add Investment" button automatically creates a new entry on the right side of the investment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Enter Details**: A new panel opens, allowing you to input key investment information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   **Name**: Type in a name for the investment, such as "X investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Input the initial monetary value of the investment, for example, $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units**: Specify the number of units held at the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
3.  **Categorization**: Initially, a new investment might be listed under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. You can easily categorize it under existing groups like "stocks" or "crypto" by clicking the three dots next to the entry and moving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
4.  **Adding New Categories**: If an existing [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | category]] does not fit, you can create a new group by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For instance, you could type "bonds" to create a new section for bond investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  **Editing Existing Items**: To modify an already added investment, click on its entry and type in the desired changes, then click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Adding Investment Transactions

The tracker also provides quick action buttons for adding specific types of [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | transactions]]â€”buying and selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### "Buy Investment" Button
*   **Functionality**: Clicking "Buy Investment" automatically adds a new entry under the "buy" view of the [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | transactions]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Date Autofill**: The system automatically picks the current date when the button is clicked, though it can be changed to any desired date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Details to Fill**: Users then manually fill in details such as the description, investment account, number of units, and the buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The buy amount is automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### "Sell Investment" Button
*   **Functionality**: Similarly, clicking "Sell Investment" creates a new line item under the "sell" view in the [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | transactions]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Details to Fill**: Users can input the relevant sale information, including the description, investment account, units sold, and the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The sale amount is calculated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

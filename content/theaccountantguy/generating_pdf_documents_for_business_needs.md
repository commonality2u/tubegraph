[[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | Utilizing PDF Output for Document Generation]] is simplified through the online tool, PDFoutput.com, designed for creating business-specific PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Key Features

Upon logging in, users encounter an interface that facilitates the creation of PDF documents. Key features include:

*   **Template Selection**: Users can choose from various templates, such as an [[using_pdf_output_for_invoice_generation | invoice template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Currency Options**: Multiple currency options are available, allowing users to select their preferred currency for documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Changing the selected currency automatically updates the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## PDF Document Generation Modes

The platform offers two primary modes for [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents | generating and downloading PDF documents]]:

### Single PDF Mode

In this mode, users manually fill in details corresponding to the chosen template, such as an invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Once the information is entered, a PDF document can be automatically generated by clicking "Download PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. The generated PDF will reflect all the filled-in details and selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### Bulk Export Mode

For [[automating_pdf_document_generation | automating PDF document generation]] for multiple documents, the bulk export mode is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. In this mode:
1.  Users fill in a database with the necessary details for multiple documents (e.g., invoices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This database includes fields like invoice number, invoice date, and item details, similar to the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
2.  Columns in the database can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
3.  After populating the database, clicking "Download All PDF" initiates the generation of PDF documents one by one based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
4.  Individual PDFs for specific rows can also be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The bulk export feature supports generating PDFs with different currencies selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Future Developments

The platform currently supports a live database feature for [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents | exporting and managing PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Future updates plan to include integration with Notion databases, allowing users to add details in Notion and export documents directly from PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. The platform will also be adding more templates, and users can submit requests for specific template needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

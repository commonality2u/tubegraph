When [[Using Notion for calculations | calculating]] the difference between two numbers in Notion, two primary methods can be employed: the `subtract` operator and the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article focuses on utilizing the `subtract` operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Setting Up a Database

To begin, you need to create a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can be done by typing a forward slash (`/`) and then `database` to select from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Within this database:
*   The first property is typically the `Title` property, which helps in identifying the purpose of the entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   You must assign number properties to two different columns, which will hold the numbers for which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Using the Subtract Operator

After setting up your number properties, you can add a [[Using formulas in Notion | formula]] property to calculate the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The `subtract` operator is designed to take two numbers as input and return their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For example, if you have `Number One` and `Number Two` as your input properties, the `subtract` operator will take these as inputs to yield the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Alternative: The Minus Sign

While the `subtract` operator is available, the difference between two numbers can also be found using the simpler minus sign (`-`) in a [[Using formulas in Notion | Notion formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For a detailed comparison, refer to [[difference_between_subtract_operator_and_minus_sign_in_notion | Difference between Subtract Operator and Minus Sign in Notion]].

Both methods achieve the goal of [[using_formulas_to_subtract_in_notion | subtracting numbers in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

To find the difference between two numbers in Notion, two primary methods can be employed: using the subtract operator or using the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09"></a>.

## Database Setup

First, create a database by typing a forward slash `/` and then `database` to select from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>.

Within this database:
*   Assign a title property to signify the operation being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33"></a>.
*   Assign number properties to two different numbers from which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>.

## Using the Subtract Operator

A [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] property can be used to find the difference between two numbers using the subtract operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51"></a>. For example, by providing `number one` and `number two` as input, their difference can be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>.

## Using the Minus Sign

Similarly, the [[minus_sign_for_subtraction_in_notion | minus sign]] (`-`) can also be used within a [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] property to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06"></a>.

These methods allow users to find the difference between two numbers in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12"></a>.

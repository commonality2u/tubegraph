The accounts receivable and payable tracker is designed to help users track all customer and vendor balances efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This [[payments_tracker | tracker]] features various sections and views to manage financial transactions.

## Tracker Sections

The tracker is organized into several key sections to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed management of receivables and payables.

### Accounts View

The top section of the [[payments_tracker | tracker]] includes an "accounts" view, which is used for setting up customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Adding Accounts**: Users can add new vendors or customers using quick action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Clicking "ADD vendor" or "ADD customer" automatically creates a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: Once an entry is added, details can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Opening Balances**: Users can input the starting balance (opening balance) for both receivables and payables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Pending Invoices**: The number of invoices pending against the opening balance can also be recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Receivable Section

This section reflects all receivable accounts and their associated details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Customer Details**: It displays customer names and related transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Transaction Overview**: Users can see all transactions, including invoice dates, invoice numbers, and amounts raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Invoice Status**: The status of each invoice can be changed (e.g., "Paid," "Unpaid") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Marking as Paid**: A checkbox allows users to mark an invoice as "paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When checked, the amount is no longer calculated in the outstanding balance at the top of the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If unchecked, it recalculates the outstanding balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance**: For each customer, an outstanding balance is reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Payable Section

Similar to the receivable section, the payable section shows details for each payable transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   It displays transaction dates, invoice numbers, invoice status, and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Users can mark invoices as paid, which helps in tracking outstanding payable amounts at the top of the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Summary Section

The [[summary_of_receivables_and_payables | summary section]] provides an overall financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   It reflects the total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   It shows the total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   It calculates the net balance (total receivable less total payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Transaction Section

This section is where individual transactions are recorded and managed, divided into receivable, payable, and quarterly summary segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

#### Receivable Segment
*   **Data Fields**: Includes fields for date, period (broken down into quarters), description, account name (customer), amount, invoice number, and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   "Add Payable Entry" button is available for quick entry of payable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary

This section provides a consolidated [[summary_of_receivables_and_payables | summary]] of all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   A slider allows users to navigate through different quarters to view their respective financial summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

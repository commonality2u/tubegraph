The Notion personal finance tracker provides dedicated sections to manage both recurring bills and subscriptions, offering a clear overview of upcoming and past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Setting Up Subscription and Bill Accounts

To begin tracking, accounts for subscriptions and bills must first be created or modified in the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

2.  Under "Expenses," click the "new" button to add a new expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  Provide a name for the bill or subscription (e.g., "Wi-Fi bills" or "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Tracking Subscriptions and Bills in the Summary View

After entering transactions, the "Summary" section provides an overview of your recurring payments. This is where you can view your [[how_to_use_a_subscription_expenses_tracker_in_notion | subscription expenses tracker]] details.

### Bills Section
1.  Navigate to the "Summary" section and click on the "Bills" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
2.  This section has two primary views: "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
    *   **Upcoming Payments**: Reflects bills where the next payment is due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. The system calculates this based on the last payment date and the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. For example, if a monthly utility bill was paid on August 17th, the next payment due date will show as September 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
    *   **Past Payments**: Shows payments that were due in the past but may not have been recorded or were made in the previous period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. This helps identify missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
3.  You can customize the layout (e.g., list, gallery, board) and visible properties of this view using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Subscriptions Section
1.  Navigate to the "Summary" section and click on the "Subscription" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
2.  Similar to the bills section, it features "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
3.  The system determines the next due date based on the last recorded payment and the defined payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
4.  The subscription status (e.g., Active) is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses
The overall finance view, part of the summary section, provides a quick overview of all income and expenses, along with their respective contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For more details on this, refer to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | Tracking Income and Expenses in Notion]].

## Application for Couples
This Notion dashboard is also suitable for couples to track their finances. Accounts can be split to denote income or expenses by "him" or "her," allowing for individual tracking within the shared system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

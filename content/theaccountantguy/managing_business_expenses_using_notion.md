Anis Biswal, known as The Accountant Guy, introduces a business budget template designed to help users [[budgeting_for_a_business | keep track of budgeting for a business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This template aims to assist in managing expenses and staying within a set budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template features a "Business Expenses Summary" at the top, divided into three main sections: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Account Section
In the Account section, users can set up different heads of expenses, categorized under "Operational," "Administration," or "Marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

-   **Adding New Categories**: To add a new expense category, users can scroll to the right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
-   **Editing Existing Categories**: Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
-   **Budgeted Amount**: After setting up expense categories, a budgeted amount can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. New accounts can also be added under an existing category with a budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Expenses Section
This section displays current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

-   **Visual Indicators**:
    -   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    -   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
-   **Updates**: All data in this section automatically updates as transactions are entered in the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Summary Section
The Summary section provides an overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects:

-   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
-   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
-   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
-   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The Transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is where users book expenses under their respective heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Adding Expenses
Expenses can be quickly added using several methods:

-   **Quick Buttons**: Buttons on the left side of the screen, such as the "Operational expense" button, can be used to quickly add an expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
-   **Quick Add Button**: A quick button at the top labeled "adding an expense source" allows for adding different expenses under each head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
-   **New Icon**: Clicking the "new" icon can also quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

When adding an expense, users can input a description, associate the expense with a relevant account, and enter the desired amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Editing Expenses
The date of an expense can be changed by clicking on the date field and selecting a new date, which will automatically update the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This article explains how to add and manage tenants within a Notion template designed for [[setting_up_house_rent_payments_tracker_in_notion | house rent payments]]. This template allows users to track rental payments and manage tenant information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Overview of Tenant Management

The template features a summary section with four distinct views to help manage tenant and property information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Adding and Organizing Tenants

Tenants can be added and classified under various property types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Pre-set classifications like "apartment" and "duplex" are available, but users can customize these property categories as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

To add a new tenant:
1.  Click the "Add tenant" button located on the left side of the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This action automatically creates a new tenant entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  Click the three-dot icon next to the new tenant entry to drag and place it under the appropriate property category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon to enter or edit the tenant's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Viewing Tenant and Property Information

The "property section" provides an organized view of different property classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Underneath each property, you can view the names of the tenants and key financial information, including:
*   Total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Rent amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Balance rent amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Advanced rent paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

The "rental history" section displays the payment history for all tenants based on recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

A final summary section provides an [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] of financial metrics, including:
*   Total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Outstanding rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Percentage of rent collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

### Managing Transactions Related to Tenants

The transaction section offers three distinct views for [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | transaction management]]:

*   **Rent Paid**: This view shows all transactions where rent has been paid, along with the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Rent Due**: This view displays information for rent amounts that are due and have not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Checking the box next to an entry here will move it to the "Rent Paid" category, indicating payment has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Summary**: This view provides a summary of rental payments, collections, and balance due for each month within respective quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

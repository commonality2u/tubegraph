The Sales Performance OS template allows for comprehensive customization and filtering of sales data to track business performance throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>.

## Sales Performance OS Overview

The Sales Performance OS provides three main components under the [[components_of_a_sales_dashboard | sales dashboard]]:
*   **Salesperson** This section details the sales made by each salesperson per month, including achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of target achieved, and target status (achieved/not achieved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, while "Target not achieved" is shown if sales are below the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel** This component displays sales made through various sources (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) per month, showing achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of sales, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Sales Location** This section tracks sales made to different locations, showing sales, targeted sales, percentage of sales, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

On the left, an overview section provides total sales, sale units, and average sales for each salesperson, sales channel, and sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>. This information helps track overall business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>.

## Data Entry and Targets

Sales transactions can be added to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:03">[02:19:03]</a>. The sales transaction window allows for entering:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>
*   Account Details (salesperson information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:53">[02:42:53]</a>
*   Sales Details (what is being sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:53">[02:48:53]</a>
*   Month and Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:53">[02:52:53]</a>
*   Salesperson Detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:53">[02:55:53]</a>
*   Client Detail (to whom the sale was made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>
*   Sales Code (unique to each salesperson and month/year, e.g., 'jcore_december23' for James Carter in December 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:53">[03:04:53]</a>
*   Sales Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:53">[03:33:53]</a>
*   Sales Unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:53">[03:36:53]</a>

Sales targets can be set at the start of each month for individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:53">[03:21:53]</a>, sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:53">[04:02:53]</a>, and sales locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:53">[04:05:53]</a>. A "Sales Target" quick action button automatically assigns these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:53">[03:42:53]</a>.

## Customization Options

The dashboard is entirely customizable to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:53">[03:34:53]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Details**: Salesperson names can be instantly added or edited through a dedicated dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:53">[05:44:53]</a>. Details such as a cover image can also be set for each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:53">[06:20:53]</a>.
*   **Months and Years**: New months can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:53">[06:49:53]</a>, and years can be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:53">[06:53:53]</a>.
*   **Client Details**: Client names can be entered directly, and more detailed client information (address, city, state) can be added in a separate client dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:53">[06:59:53]</a>.
*   **Currency**: The currency for the entire dashboard can be changed to a preferred choice by clicking on the currency sign and modifying the number format property for amount fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:53">[07:36:53]</a>.

## Filtering Sales Data

The sales data can be filtered to display specific information:
*   **By Year**: Use the filter option and select "year" to view sales data for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:53">[08:15:53]</a>.
*   **By Month**: Use the filter option and select "month" to view data for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:53">[08:36:53]</a>.
*   **Combination Filters**: Filters can be combined, such as viewing all months for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:53">[08:42:53]</a>.

This [[filtering_and_viewing_budget_data | filtering]] capability allows for detailed analysis of sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:53">[08:54:53]</a>.

This article details how to [[Formulating Notion Formulas | formulate Notion formulas]] to calculate the product of two numbers within a Notion database, specifically highlighting the use of the multiplication symbol and operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Database Setup
To calculate a product, a Notion database needs to be set up with specific properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   A "Name" property, which acts as a title property for the operator (e.g., "multiply operator") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Two number properties for the input values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Formula properties to display the calculated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication
There are two primary methods demonstrated for [[Formulas for multiplication in Notion | calculating the product of two numbers]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula
This method involves using the dedicated [[Using multiply operator in Notion | multiply operator formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Numbers are provided as inputs to this formula to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   For example, entering 2 and 3 as numbers yields a product of 6 using this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiplication Symbol (`*`)
Another approach is to simply use the multiplication symbol (`*`) between the two numbers in a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   This method directly multiplies the two numbers by placing the `*` symbol in between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Both formulas can be used to effectively [[Formulas for multiplication in Notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

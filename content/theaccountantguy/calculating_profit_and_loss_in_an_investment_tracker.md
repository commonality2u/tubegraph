This article details how to utilize an [[portfolio_tracker | Investment Portfolio Tracker]] to calculate and monitor profit and loss for your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tracker helps you [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | track all your investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker

The [[portfolio_tracker | Investment Portfolio Tracker]] includes a dedicated [[profit_and_loss_section_in_notion_for_tax_purposes | profit and loss section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This section displays the total profit and loss for each investment after all transactions are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A profit or loss figure is available for every investment, updating as transactions occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Additionally, the tracker provides a summation of profit or loss for each investment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

The tracker lists all [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | transactions]] carried out for your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These can be viewed in an "all" view, which combines both sell and buy transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For every transaction, you need to input the date, description, type of transaction (buy/sell), the specific investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), the number of units, and the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The amount is automatically calculated by multiplying units by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The tracker also offers separate views for "buy" and "sell" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. When buying, you fill in the buy price, and the buy amount is automatically calculated as it is formula-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The same applies to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Calculating Profit or Loss

The [[profit_and_loss_section_in_notion_for_tax_purposes | profit and loss section]] clearly shows the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
This section provides additional information beyond the general transaction view, specifically the buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By inputting the buy amount, the tracker will reflect the profit or loss from that specific transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Profit Calculation
> If 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each, totaling $1,200 in sales value, and the same 30 units were initially bought for $10 each, the profit generated would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This is calculated as the difference between the sell price ($40) and the buy price ($10), multiplied by the 30 units ($30 x 30 units = $900 profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker provides quick action buttons to streamline the process of [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | adding transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Buy Investment:** Clicking this button automatically adds a new entry under the "buy" view, pre-populating the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment:** Similarly, this button creates a new line item under the "sell" view, allowing you to feed in the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

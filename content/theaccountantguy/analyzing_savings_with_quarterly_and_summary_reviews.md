This template is designed to help users track their emergency funds effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive overview through three main sections: Fund Setup, Savings Overview, and a Summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Emergency Funds

The "Fund Setup" section allows for defining and organizing various emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Fund Categories

Emergency funds are categorized to help with organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The default categories include:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

These categories can be customized by editing existing names or adding new groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding New Funds

To add a new fund, users can simply click the "Add Fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Newly added funds initially appear under a "No Classification" tab and can then be moved to the appropriate category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Defining Fund Details

Each emergency fund has specific details that can be configured:
*   **Fund Detail**: A customizable description for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount held in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for this specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This is crucial for [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | calculating savings goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date when contributions to the fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The desired date by which the total emergency fund amount should be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Once these details are set, the template automatically calculates the savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Tracking Contributions

The "Contribution" section is where users record money put into each emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

For each contribution entry, the following details are recorded:
*   **Date**: The specific date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief note about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Users can add new months as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Fund**: The specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The amount of savings contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: This column automatically calculates the required monthly contribution to meet the fund's goal by the targeted end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A tick mark appears if the contribution meets or exceeds the required amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

A "quick action button" is available to automatically add a new line item for the current date and month, simplifying data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

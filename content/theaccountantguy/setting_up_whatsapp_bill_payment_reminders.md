This article outlines how to set up automated bill payment reminders directly on your WhatsApp, ensuring you receive timely notifications for recurring payments like mobile or Wi-Fi bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Creating a New Bill Reminder

To begin setting up a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the provided drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of your bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, such as "$1500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
5.  Click "back" to save the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

This process enables [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | automating bill payment reminders using templates]] by creating a new entry for your bill.

## Setting Bill Recurrence and Notification Times

After creating the bill entry, you can set its recurrence and notification preferences:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots next to your bill entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis, selecting "every month" for monthly bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
4.  [[specifying_bill_recurrence_and_notification_times | Specify the time]] you wish to receive the notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For example, you can choose to receive a notification at 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, this reminder will repeat every month on the specified date, sending a notification to your WhatsApp at the chosen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

For the automated notifications to work, the system requires the help of an automation tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for setting up this automation are included when you download the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Receiving Automated Notifications

Once the automation is set up, you will consistently [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | receive automated notifications on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. As soon as a template is configured for recurring payments (e.g., every month), you will automatically start receiving these notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

For instance, if a notification is set for 11:55 AM on September 20th, the message will typically be received around 11:56 AM, demonstrating that the notification is sent within approximately one minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This ensures you receive a notification on WhatsApp for every bill added and set through this template each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

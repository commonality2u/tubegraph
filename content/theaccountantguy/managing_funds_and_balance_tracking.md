This budgeting tracker template offers various features to help manage financial requirements, including [[income_and_expense_management | income and expense management]], [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | debt tracking]], and [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget management]].

## Core Components
The tracker is built around five key components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

For each of these components, you can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Setting Targets and Tracking Progress
*   **Income**: Set a "goal amount" for each income component per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Expense**: Define a "budget amount" for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Budget Status**: A percentage indicates how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A "budget status" shows whether you have stayed within or exceeded the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Overview and Detailed Views
The left side of the tracker provides an [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | overview]] of all elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Using a dropdown, you can select specific components like "income overview" to see all added income categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   For each income category, it displays the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This is an aggregate across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   For expense sources, you will see the targeted amount and the actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Users can add an unlimited number of categories for each component, which will automatically update the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Inputting Transactions
Transactions are entered in a dedicated section with quick buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Clicking an "income" button automatically adds an income entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Required Details**:
    *   Detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   Month (can be typed, e.g., "Jan 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   Year (can be typed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
    *   Category (e.g., "salary," "side income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> – Categories can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Code (source of income/expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> – Used to collate specific sources for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Budget amount (set at the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   Actual amount (entered as the month progresses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

### Monthly Overview
Below the main input section, there is a [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly overview]] that mirrors the top summary but with month-wise divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   When new months are added (e.g., entering an expense for February), the monthly overview automatically updates to reflect the new period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   As you enter actual amounts for categories (e.g., food expense for February), the overview displays the budget amount, actual incurred amount, and the percentage of the budget used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   The system indicates if you are still "under budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Funds Balance Tracking
A "funds balance" view shows the total income and total spendings for each month, along with the remaining balance at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   [[tracking_income_expenses_and_cash_flow_movements | Income entries]] automatically update the balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Spendings include expenses, [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | debt payments]], bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   This feature provides a quick glance at the funds available in your account monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Filtering and Customization
The tracker supports dynamic filtering for:
*   **Year**: You can filter all data for a specific year (e.g., 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Month**: You can also filter for a specific month (e.g., January) across all years or a specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Currency can be changed from the default dollar to any other currency by accessing the number format options within the edit property settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

This article explains how to utilize a charity donation tracker in Notion to track all your donations towards charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is divided into three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section allows you to organize your donations into categories and individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Categories
Donations are initially divided into three default categories: Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories:** You can edit existing categories by clicking on them and typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** To add a new category, slide the slider at the bottom to the right, click the plus icon, and create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Funds
Under each category, specific funds are listed, such as American Red Cross, WHO, and Care funds for Health; Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and The Rainforest Foundation for Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   **Adding New Funds:** Click the "Add funds" button to create a new fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The new fund will initially appear without classification, requiring you to slide to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. You can then click the three dots and move it to any existing category, for example, Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Editing Fund Details:** Once a fund is placed, click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Name of the Fund:** Enter the name of the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance:** Input the amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Targeted Donation:** Set the desired donation amount for this specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Start Date:** Define when you began donating to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **Target Date:** Set the end goal date by which you aim to reach the targeted donation for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Deleting Funds:** Click the three dots next to a fund and select "Delete" to remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Recent Donations

The "Recent Donations" section tracks all individual donations made, split by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

*   **Donation Details:** For each donation, you can enter:
    *   **Date:** When the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

    *   **Fund:** Select the specific fund from those set up in the "Fund Setup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Recommended:** This figure indicates the monthly contribution needed from the start date to reach the targeted donation amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Amount:** Input the actual amount of donation made for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   **Checkmark/Crossmark:** A checkmark signifies that the donation contributed was enough or exceeded the monthly requirement, while a crossmark indicates it fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Adding Donations:** Click the "Add donation" button to automatically add a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

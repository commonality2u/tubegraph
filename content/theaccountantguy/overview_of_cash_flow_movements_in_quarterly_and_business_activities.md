These sections allow users to track the flow of cash into and out of the business, providing a comprehensive financial summary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Quarterly Overview

The [[quarterly_overview_for_emergency_savings | Quarterly Overview]] section offers a detailed look at cash flow movements for each month, organized into four quarters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

*   **Key Metrics**
    *   **Inflow:** Represents the total cash that has entered the business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

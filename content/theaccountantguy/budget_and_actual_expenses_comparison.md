This article discusses tracking business expenses, particularly for construction projects, using a Notion template that facilitates [[comparison_of_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses | comparison of actual vs budgeted expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The template is designed to help users [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | budget and track business expenses]] in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Template Structure

The Notion template organizes expenses by categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, it displays:
*   A [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table at the bottom of the template, allowing for real-time updates as values are modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Changes in the expense table are reflected corresponding to the category at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Managing Expense Categories and Budgeted Amounts

The template provides flexibility for [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | managing budgeted vs actual expenses]] and categories:
*   **Editing Categories**: Existing categories can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories**: New categories can be added by clicking "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: Categories can be deleted by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Expenses**: The budgeted expense amount for any category can be defined or modified by clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Summary Section

A summary section provides an overview of the [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budget vs actual expenses tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, offering insights into overall financial performance:
*   **Total Budget Expense**: The sum of all defined budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Total Actual Expenses**: The sum of all actual expenses pulled from the expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The variance between the total budget and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Actual Expenses Incurred**: The proportion of actual expenses relative to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

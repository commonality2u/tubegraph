Automating [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | expense tracking]] can be achieved by setting up subscription payment reminders that are delivered directly to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system utilizes a [[using_databases_for_financial_tracking_in_notion | database]], such as one in Notion, to manage and send these alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Setting Up Subscription Reminders

To configure a subscription reminder:
1.  Access the database and click on the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Create a new template or entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
3.  Select the option to set up a "subscription reminder alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Specify the subscription name, for example, "Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  Enter the subscription amount, such as 150 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
6.  Click "background" to add the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, which will appear as a new tablet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
7.  Click on the three dots next to the entry, then select "repeat" to set the repetition mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
8.  Choose the desired frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This will cause the subscription entry to repeat each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
9.  A new window will open where you can specify the exact time and start date for the reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
10. After saving, a repetition arrow will appear next to the entry, indicating the reminder is set to automatically repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set up, a new line item will automatically be added to the database at the specified time and date each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This action triggers an automatic notification alert to be sent to your WhatsApp account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For example, a Spotify payment reminder for $150 will be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The notification typically includes a "pay now" link, allowing for direct payment through the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Customization and Support

> [!NOTE] Customization
> The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is fully [[customizing_expense_tracking_for_personal_needs | customizable]] to meet your specific requirements, rather than being a fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Instructions and a guide for setting up this automation are included when you download the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

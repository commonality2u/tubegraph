The Notion Expenses Tracker is a template designed to help users [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track expenses]] and manage finances in one centralized place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It supports both personal and business expense tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Key Features for Budgeting and Tracking

The tracker emphasizes the distinction between budgeted and actual spending, offering several features to facilitate this comparison:

### Category Management
The tracker includes a category section that initially contains three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Every category can be defined, renamed, edited, or deleted according to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories**: New categories can be added easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses Per Category
For each category, the tracker displays both a budgeted expense amount and an actual expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts**: Users can [[editing_and_managing_budgeted_amounts_for_travel_expenses | set their own budgeted expense]] amounts for each category as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: As expenses are entered into the system, the corresponding categories are automatically updated with the actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Summary Section
A dedicated summary section provides an overview of the [[tracking_and_analyzing_actual_versus_budgeted_expenses | overall financial status]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Total Budgeted Expense**: Shows the total amount allocated across all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Total Actual Expenses**: The total actual expenses are computed from the detailed expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Difference and Percentage**: The summary also displays the difference between the budgeted and actual expenses, along with the percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The template is fully customizable to meet various [[setting_budget_goals_and_tracking_progress | tracking needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

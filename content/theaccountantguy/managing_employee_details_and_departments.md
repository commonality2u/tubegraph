The [[using_employee_schedule_templates | employee schedule template]] is a tool designed to [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | keep track of employee schedules]] and manage various aspects of employee information within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. The template is divided into four main views: Employee Details, Task Schedule, Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>. This article specifically focuses on the "Employee Details" section, which serves as the primary hub for [[employee_record_management | employee record management]].

## Employee Details View

The "Employee Details" view lists the details of all employees along with their relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a>. It is the initial step for populating the employee schedule system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>.

## Adding and Managing Employees

To add a new employee to the system:
*   Click on the "New" button within the Employee Details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.
*   Alternatively, a "quick action" button labeled "Add employee" is available at the top, which automatically adds a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31"></a>.

When adding a new employee, you will be prompted to enter essential information:
*   Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>
*   Employee ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>
*   Contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a>

Once an employee detail is added, further information can be specified by clicking on their entry:
*   Employee ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17"></a>
*   Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17"></a>
*   Position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>
*   Contact Detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20"></a>
*   Email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20"></a>

## Categorizing Employees by Department

The template allows for the categorization of employees into different departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46"></a>. Examples of pre-defined categories include Operations, Marketing, and Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>.

*   **Adding New Categories:** Click on the plus icon to add a new department category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53"></a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories:** Click on an existing category to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>.

Once an employee's department is set in the Employee Details section, this information automatically populates in other views, such as the Task Schedule, associating the employee with their respective department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>.

The charity donation tracker dashboard in Notion can be configured to display financial figures in any currency of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54"></a>. Notion offers support for a wide array of different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49"></a>.

Although the process involves a separate setup, the currency settings can be [[customizing_dashboard_views_and_currency_settings_in_Notion | adjusted to any preferred currency]] within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00"></a>. Additional guidance on how to navigate the dashboard and change these currency settings is available through a linked video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00"></a>. This flexibility allows users to [[adjusting_currency_settings_in_notion_for_expense_tracking | track their donations]] in their local or desired currency.

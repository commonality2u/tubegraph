The "Assets and Liabilities Breakdown" is a key component of a Notion-based net worth tracker, designed to provide detailed insights into an individual's financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This tracker requires the use of five types of databases to be fully functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Assets Breakdown

The assets breakdown section provides a detailed view of an individual's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   It specifies individual assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Assets are classified into five categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   It shows the amount of each asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   It indicates the proportion of each asset relative to the total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The total amount for each asset from all months combined is represented as a rolled-up formula from an earlier database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   The total assets value is calculated and rolled up from another database using a specific formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   The percentage of each asset to the total value of all combined assets is calculated and represented visually with a green bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   On the primary [[Dashboard analysis for personal finance | dashboard]], the assets breakdown is linked to its respective database and displayed in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Liabilities Breakdown

Similar to the assets breakdown, the liabilities breakdown section offers a detailed view of an individual's liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   It specifies four types of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   It shows the corresponding amount for each liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   It indicates the proportion of each liability to the total amount of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   The calculation of percentages for liabilities mirrors that of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   On the primary [[Dashboard analysis for personal finance | dashboard]], the liabilities breakdown is linked to its respective database and displayed in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

These breakdowns are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of one's [[financial_management_of_assets | financial management]] and overall net worth.

### Setting Up Accounts
To begin tracking income and expenses, navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Here, you'll find all income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:
*   **Income**: Examples include "salary" and "side hustle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Examples include "groceries," "utility bills," and "Netflix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

You can modify existing accounts or add new ones by clicking the "Edit" or "New" button respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

You can also set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For income and expense accounts, the opening balance can be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### [[Tracking budgeted and actual expenses | Tracking Income and Expenses]] (Finances View)
Once transactions are entered, you can [[Setting Budget Goals and Tracking Progress | track income and expenses]] under the "Summary" view by selecting "Finances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This view displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>:
*   Total income/expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Percentage contribution of each income/expense head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Figures automatically update as transactions are changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

1.  Ensure all income and expense transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Summary" view and click on "Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
3.  This section outlines all expenses and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
4.  It shows the total incurred expenses and their percentage relative to the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
5.  You can change the budgeted amount for any expense or income item, and the percentages will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

> [!TIP] Accessing Budgeted Amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>
> If the "budgeted amount" property is not visible, click on any property within the budget view, then search for "budgeted amount" to enable and edit its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Application for Couples
The dashboard is also applicable for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. In the "Account" section, different categories of accounts can be split per individual (e.g., "salary by him," "side hustle by her") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. This allows for tracking finances for each person within the shared system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

### Viewing Specific Transactions
To quickly view all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., "salary"), navigate to the "Finances" section under the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. Click on the desired income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. A window will open on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Scroll down and click on "View Transactions" to see only transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

The quarterly overview section of the emergency fund template provides a consolidated view of monthly savings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This feature allows users to assess their progress in meeting emergency fund goals at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Structure and Organization
The quarterly overview organizes months into their respective quarters:
*   **Quarter 1** includes January, February, and March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Quarter 2** includes April, May, and June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Quarter 3** includes July, August, and September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Quarter 4** includes October, November, and December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The most recent month appears at the top within its quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Key Metrics and Indicators
For each month and quarter, the overview displays:
*   **Total Savings Made:** The total amount contributed for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Required Savings:** The target contribution amount needed for the month to meet the overall emergency fund goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Savings Requirement Percentage:** A percentage indicating how much of the monthly target has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. For example, contributing $300 against a $422 requirement results in 71% of the target met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Total Quarterly Savings:** The sum of all contributions made within a specific quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. For example, if $900 and $300 were saved, the total for Quarter 4 would be $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

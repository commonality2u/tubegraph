This article provides an overview of a [[notion_budget_tracker_overview | Notion budget tracker]] template, designed to fulfill various [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]] and tracking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers different options to manage financial requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Main Components of the Template

The [[notion_budget_tracker_overview | budgeting tracker]] is structured around five core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, income has a "goal amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and expenses have a "budget amount" that updates automatically as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Budget Status and Percentage Tracking

The template displays a percentage indicating how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Below this, a "budget status" shows whether expenses are beyond the budgeted amount or within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:01:00]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Component Overviews

On the left side of the template, users can get an overview of all elements within each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:10]</a>. By selecting a component from a dropdown, such as "income overview," it displays all added income categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:20]</a>. For each category, it shows the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:28]</a>. This overview aggregates data across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:32]</a>.

For expense sources, the overview shows the targeted amount and the incurred expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:46]</a>. Users can add as many categories as needed for each component, and the display will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To input transactions, users scroll down to a section with quick buttons for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:14]</a>. Clicking an "income" button, for example, automatically adds an income entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:24]</a>.

For each entry, users need to provide:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date**: The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month**: The month in which the income or expense occurred (e.g., "Jan 2024"), which can be typed in for automatic addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Year**: The year of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the source of income or expense (e.g., "salary," "side hustle," "food," "entertainment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:08]</a>. Categories can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique code representing the source of income or expense, used to collate data for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: Set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:04]</a>.

All these details are entered for income, expenses, and other heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:16]</a>. Currency can be changed from dollars to other options within the number format settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Monthly Overview

Below the transaction input section, there is a detailed monthly summary, mirroring the top summary but with a month-wise division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:40]</a>. For instance, the "expenses of summary" displays categories like "food," "entertainment," and "shopping," showing how they fall under specific months like "Jan 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:58]</a>. Adding new entries for different months automatically creates new monthly sections in this overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:23]</a>.

As actual amounts are entered for budgeted categories, the system updates the percentage of budget incurred and the budget status (e.g., "under budget") for that specific month and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:07:01]</a>. This helps users understand their [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budgeting]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering

The template allows for dynamic filtering of data:
*   **Filter by Year**: Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year, such as 2024, to see all values for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Filter by Month**: Data can also be filtered by a specific month, showing details for that month across all years or for a specific year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Funds Balance

A "funds balance" section shows the total income, total spending, and the remaining balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:32]</a>. When income entries are made, the balance automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:45]</a>. This section provides a quick glance at the account balance at the end of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:00]</a> and can also be dynamically filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:03]</a>.

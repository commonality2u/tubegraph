The Notion Books Freelancers OS dashboard provides a dedicated section for [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | managing invoices]] within its Client Management portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, which is part of the broader system for tracking income, expenses, and finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Overview of the Invoicing Section

The invoicing section categorizes invoices by their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>:
*   **Draft**: Invoices that are currently being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Sent**: Invoices that have been issued to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Paid**: Invoices for which payment has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

At the top of the invoicing section, a "Total Invoice Amount" is displayed, reflecting the sum of all invoices listed below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Users can also choose to display the count of unique invoices under each category instead of the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## How to Add an Invoice

There are two primary ways to add invoices:

### 1. Adding Directly in the Invoicing Section

To add a new invoice directly:
1.  Click the "New" button under the desired status category (e.g., "Sent") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
2.  Enter the invoice number (e.g., "Invoice 0003") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
3.  Set the "Due Date" for the invoice using the calendar picker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The invoice amount will be automatically populated from the workflow section once linked to an income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### 2. Adding via the Workflow Section (Recommended for Linking)

The workflow section, located at the bottom of the Client Management dashboard, shows all client-related income carried over from the [[adding_and_managing_transactions_in_notion | finance setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This section is filtered to show only income classified under "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

To create and link an invoice using the workflow:
1.  Locate the income entry in the workflow section.
2.  In the "Invoice" column for that income, click to open the dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
3.  You can either select an existing invoice or instantly create a new one by typing its number (e.g., "Invoice 0004") and clicking "Add new invoice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
4.  Once created this way, the new invoice will automatically appear in the main invoicing section under "Draft" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. You can then drag it to the appropriate status (e.g., "Paid") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> The recommended workflow is to add clients, projects, and services first, then manage invoicing details through the workflow section at the bottom, which automatically populates the corresponding top-level sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Managing Invoice Details and Status

### Linking Invoices to Clients, Projects, and Services
When an income entry is linked to an invoice in the workflow section, you can also link it to a specific client, project, and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This ensures that the invoice amount is reflected against the correct client, project, and service records in their respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

For example, assigning an income to "Client A," "Project A," and "Digital Marketing" service will update Client A's total invoice amount, Project A's completion percentage (if based on invoicing), and the Digital Marketing service's associated income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### Updating Invoice Status and Payment Mode
*   **Updating Status**: In the main invoicing section, you can drag and drop invoices between "Draft," "Sent," and "Paid" columns to update their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: In the workflow section, the "Payment Mode" column indicates if the money for an invoice has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
    *   If payment has not yet been received (e.g., for "Draft" or "Sent" invoices), remove the "Bank" entry in this column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
    *   Once payment is received, set the "Payment Mode" to "Bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. This action automatically updates the [[creating_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | banking calculations]] in the [[adding_and_managing_transactions_in_notion | finance view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

### Editing Invoice Properties
To edit any invoice details, click on the pencil icon or the invoice name itself to open its dedicated page, where you can modify properties like due date, linked client, project, or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

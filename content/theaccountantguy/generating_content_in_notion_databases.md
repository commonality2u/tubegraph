Veen is a platform designed to [[ai_content_generation_for_notion|create AI-generated content]] directly within a Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers two main methods for content creation: Notion pages and Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While a Notion page is a blank canvas, a [[creating_a_database_in_notion|Notion database]] is structured with rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## How to Generate AI Content in a Notion Database

The process of [[generating_ai_content_on_a_notion_database|generating AI content]] in a Notion database involves a few steps to set up the connection and define the content generation parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Setting Up the Connection

1.  **Name the Connection**: Provide a descriptive name for the connection, such as "Notion database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Select Database Type**: Choose "[[creating_and_setting_up_a_notion_database|Notion database]]" as the content type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  **Provide URL**: Copy the URL of the specific Notion database and paste it into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
4.  **Proceed**: Click "next" to continue the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Content Generation

Once the connection is established, AI can generate content for each entry or "topic" within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, if a database has multiple topics in different rows, the AI can be prompted to create content for each one.

A common prompt used for this purpose is: "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After the prompt is given, the AI begins populating the content directly into the database rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The content will appear in the specified fields for each topic, row by row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

This functionality allows users to efficiently [[setting_up_and_using_databases_in_notion|generate AI content]] across multiple entries within their Notion databases, leveraging the structured format of rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

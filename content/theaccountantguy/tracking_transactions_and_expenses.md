The Paycheck Budget Tracker is a tool designed to [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | track your paycheck payments]] and budget them correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It helps users stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Key Sections

The tracker is divided into two main sections:

### Summary Section (Left Side)

This section provides an overview of your budgeting status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
*   Total [[tracking_income_and_expenses | budgeted expenses]] that have been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total [[tracking_income_and_expenses | expenses that have been incurred]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Account Section (Right Side)

Within this section, users can [[tracking_income_and_expenses | add their own expenses]] under three default categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

These category heads can be customized by clicking on them, setting a new category, and confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Users can also [[tracking_income_and_expenses | set a budgeted amount for each of these expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up budgeted amounts, users proceed to the [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Here, all [[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | transactions related to every expense]] can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The entered transactions will then reflect in the expense section, showing:
*   The total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This functionality helps users [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | keep track of their budgeted payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Quick Action Buttons

The tracker includes quick action buttons for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction**: Clicking this button automatically adds a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to feed in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **[[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | Add Expense Source]]**: This button automatically adds an expense under one of the main expense heads (Fixed, Variable, Savings/Investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users can then move this new expense source to any desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

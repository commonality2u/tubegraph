This article outlines how to use a Notion template for [[financial_management_of_assets | small business bookkeeping]], focusing on [[managing_and_classifying_assets_and_liabilities | tracking assets, liabilities, and net worth]]. The template aims to keep track of all bookkeeping needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Template Structure
The template is organized into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
1.  **Start Here:** Used for initial setup and configuring business information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Summary:** Provides an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  **Transactions Window:** Where all transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Start Here Section
This section is crucial for setting up the foundational data for your business bookkeeping.

### Account Setup
The template provides an account section to categorize financial items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Accounts are grouped under the following heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>:
*   Expenses (e.g., purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, salaries and wages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, credit card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

You can edit existing items, delete them, or add new ones to fit your business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Account Details
For each account item, you can specify the following details:

*   **Classification:** You can classify items as bills, debt, or savings, among other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This classification is used later in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

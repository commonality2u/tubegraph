This article demonstrates how to set up and customize debt payment reminders that are delivered via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These alerts provide notifications on the due date of loan payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> and can be fully modified for individual use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Key Features

*   **WhatsApp Notifications**
    Users receive debt payment reminder alerts directly on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. An example message includes details like "debt payment reminder alert," the loan type (e.g., car loan), due date (e.g., September 23), and the repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Integrated Payment Links**
    Reminders can include a "pay now" button or payment link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Clicking this link redirects the user to their bank portal or a specified payment platform (e.g., PayPal) to facilitate instant loan repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, allowing for [[integrating_payment_links_for_loan_repayments | integration of payment links for loan repayments]] and [[integrating_payment_links_with_reminder_alerts | integration of payment links with reminder alerts]]. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Customizable Messages**
    The messages are completely customizable, allowing users to create custom messages as per their requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Payment Reminders

To receive [[setting_up_automated_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | automated debt payment reminders on WhatsApp]], the process involves creating and configuring templates:

### 1. Creating Templates for Loans
The first step is to [[creating_templates_for_loan_payment_reminders | create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Click on the "new template" option from a drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Input loan details such as loan type (e.g., car loan) and repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### 2. Setting Up Recurring Notifications
To ensure messages repeat for each month on a specific day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, repetition can be set for the template. This automatically populates values for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, enabling [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | scheduling recurring bill payment notifications]].
*   Choose a monthly repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Select the day of the month for the line item to be added to the database automatically (e.g., the 16th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A specific time can also be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 3. Configuring Notification Timing
Users can specify when they want to receive the notification relative to the loan's due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This allows for [[repayment_schedules_and_customization | customized repayment schedules]].
*   To receive a notification seven days before the due date, input "7" in the "days" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   To receive the notification on the exact due date, set the value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Once a recurring template is set for a loan, it will automatically trigger an automation to send the payment notification message to WhatsApp each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Automation Demonstration
The system can demonstrate [[using_automated_notifications_for_loan_payments | automated notifications for loan payments]] by showing how a new loan, such as an "education loan," is automatically added to the database at a pre-set time (e.g., 3:55 PM on September 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Once populated, a payment alert is triggered and sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This automation can be set for any number of loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Managing Templates
After all loan payments have been repaid, users can easily [[updating_and_managing_debt_installment_details | delete any added templates]] to prevent repeated notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

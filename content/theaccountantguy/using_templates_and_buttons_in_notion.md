## Notion Templates

Notion allows users to leverage templates for efficient workflow management. A template provides a predefined set of instructions and properties that can be automatically applied when creating new entries in a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

### Creating and Customizing Templates

To create a new template for a database:
1.  Navigate to the database.
2.  Click the dropdown arrow next to the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
3.  Select "New template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
4.  Give the template a name, such as "Enter person name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
5.  Assign an icon to the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
6.  Once created, you can set it as the "default template" for that database view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. This ensures that new entries automatically include the predefined properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

While the specific example focuses on a "person's view" database, the principle of [[customizing_notion_templates | customizing Notion templates]] can be applied to various use cases, such as [[using_application_form_templates_in_notion | application forms]], [[using_templates_in_notion_for_expense_tracking | expense tracking]], or [[creating_and_using_templates_for_pdf_generation_in_notion | generating PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The speaker also notes that their pre-built relationship tracker template is available for download on Gumroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Notion Buttons

Notion buttons offer a dynamic way to perform actions within your workspace, such as adding new pages to a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

### Creating and Configuring Buttons

To create a Notion button:
1.  Type `/button` and hit enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
2.  Assign a name to the button, for example, "Add event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
3.  Choose an icon for the button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.
4.  Define the action the button will perform by clicking "Add a step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
5.  Select "Add page to" and choose the target database (e.g., an "events database") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
6.  Configure default properties for the new page, such as setting the "Event name" to "Enter event name" and the "Date" to "Today's date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

This functionality allows for simplified data entry and task management, offering an alternative to using traditional templates for creating new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Buttons can help [[personalizing_templates_with_notion_data | personalize templates with Notion data]] or automate common tasks, enhancing the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

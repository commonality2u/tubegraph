This article details how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet to [[track_income_and_expenses_in_google_sheets | track income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Overview

The spreadsheet includes a "Start Here" tab with instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The core of this [[using_google_sheets_for_tracking | Google Sheets]] system consists of three main tabs:
*   Dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

## Budget Tab

The first step in [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracking]] with this spreadsheet is to navigate to the "Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here, you will:
*   Feed in details related to your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Specify the budgeted amount for each month, whether for expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Categorize each account as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The "goal amount" column automatically totals the amounts entered for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This column is formula-driven, so for new line items, the formula needs to be dragged down to copy it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. You can also add new rows by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This tab is essential for [[budgeting_with_spreadsheets | budgeting with spreadsheets]].

## Transactions Tab

After setting up your accounts and budget estimations in the "Budget" tab, the next step is to add individual transactions in the "Transactions" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For each transaction, you will input:
*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   Details of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   The category, which links to the accounts you added in the "Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   The system automatically identifies if it's an income or expense transaction (column E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The amount related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Like the "Budget" tab, you may need to drag down formulas for new line items added to this tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Dashboard Tab

The "Dashboard" section provides a comprehensive analysis of all income and expenses you've added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This dashboard allows for detailed filtering and analysis:
*   **Filtering Options** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>:
    *   **Category:** Filter by specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   **Period:** Select specific time frames, such as the entire year (e.g., 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Type of Reference:** Choose the kind of data you want to view (e.g., all accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Key Metrics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
    *   Total income detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
    *   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
    *   Net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Overviews** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
    *   **Income Overview:** Shows different sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Expenses Overview:** Provides a breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview:** Displays income, expense, and net balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout:** Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The dashboard updates dynamically based on your chosen filters, allowing you to view overall summaries or drill down into specific income sources or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This functionality is crucial for [[tracking_and_summarizing_business_finances | tracking and summarizing business finances]] and personal finances.

Notion offers a comprehensive setup to track [[using_notion_for_personal_finance | personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, including sections for net worth targets, accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities), a summary view, debt management, [[budgeting_and_saving_with_notion | budgeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, bills, subscriptions, and a net worth overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. All these sections are interconnected through a central transaction database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Getting Started with Your Finances in Notion
To begin tracking your [[budgeting_and_expense_management_in_notion | income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts
In the "Account" section, you can categorize different accounts under income (e.g., salary, side hustle), expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix), assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Adding/Modifying Accounts**: You can add new income or expenses or modify existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Expenses can be classified into categories like "Bills" or "Subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Other classifications include "Savings" and "Debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Set how frequently you expect to pay for an expense (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: For assets and liabilities, you can specify an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Income and expenses generally do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Recording Transactions
After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Transaction Categories**: The "Transactions" view has categories like "All," "Income," "Expenses," "Assets," and "Liabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Entering Details**: For each transaction, enter the date, description, category, account, payment mode (bank/cash), transaction type (inflow/outflow), and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Inflow/Outflow**: Income is typically an "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, while expenses are "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Specific Account View**: You can click on any account in the "Finances" summary view and select "View transactions" at the bottom to see only transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

## Comprehensive Financial Overview

### Summary of Finances
The "Finances" view within the "Summary" section provides an at-a-glance overview of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It shows total amounts and the percentage contribution of each account towards the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Changes in transaction figures are instantly updated here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Debt Management
The "Debt" section tracks all debt payments, distinguishing between "upcoming payments" (due in the future) and "past payments" (already made or missed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It displays the next payment due date, total debt, and debt paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Budgeting
The [[budgeting_and_saving_with_notion | budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> section, accessible via the "Summary" view, allows you to set estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:12]</a>. It shows incurred expenses against your budgeted amount, displaying the percentage of the budget used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:30]</a>. You can easily adjust budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:42]</a>. Similarly, you can set estimated income targets and track actual income against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Savings Goals
The Notion template supports [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | setting up specific funds for savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:04]</a>. Savings accounts are classified as assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:16]</a>.

*   **Creating Savings Funds**: Add a new asset account, classify it as "Savings," and specify a goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Tracking Progress**: The savings section reflects the total amount saved so far and the percentage achieved towards your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Recording Savings Transactions**: When moving money to a savings fund, record it as an "outflow" from your main account and an addition to the savings account (an asset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:51]</a>.

### Bills and Subscriptions
Similar to debt tracking, the "Bills" and "Subscription" sections show "upcoming payments" and "past payments," helping you keep track of regular outflows and identify any missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:28]</a>. The status of subscriptions (e.g., active) is also visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Net Worth Calculation
Your net worth is the difference between your assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:33:02]</a>.

*   **Setting a Target**: In the "Net Worth Goal" section, define your target net worth for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Tracking Progress**: The "Net Worth" section in the summary view displays your current net worth, the difference from your goal, and the percentage of your goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:34:16]</a>. It also shows the "Total Growth" (closing net worth less opening net worth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:49]</a>.

### Tracking Investments
An "Investments" tab is available to track investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:05]</a>.

*   **Setup**: Investment accounts are classified as assets. You can specify opening balances and units, and importantly, classify the asset class as "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Transactions**:
    *   **Purchases**: Record investment purchases at their cost price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:20]</a>.
    *   **Sales**: When selling, record the cost value of the units being sold, not the sale price. This allows the system to calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:50]</a>.

## Additional Features and Tips

*   **Couples Tracking**: Couples can use this dashboard by splitting account categories by individual names (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") to track finances separately within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Multi-Device Compatibility**: The Notion template is accessible on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:54]</a>.
*   **Multi-Currency Support**: Notion allows you to change the currency format for all monetary values. This involves editing the "Number format" property for each relevant field (e.g., in transactions, net worth views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Notion offers a free tier, so no extra payment is required beyond the template's purchase price to use this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:22]</a>.

Notion allows users to calculate the difference between two numbers within a database using two distinct formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This can be achieved either through the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] or by employing the [[using_minus_sign_to_find_difference_in_notion | minus sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Creating a Database in Notion

To begin, you need to create a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This is done by typing a forward slash (`/`) and then "database" to select from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Within this database:
*   The first property is typically a title property, indicating the purpose of the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   You must assign number properties to two different numbers between which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Methods for Finding Difference

### Using the Subtract Operator

One method to find the difference is by using the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] within a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For example, if "number one" and "number two" are provided as inputs, the formula will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Alternatively, you can use the [[using_minus_sign_to_find_difference_in_notion | minus sign]] (`-`) directly in a formula to find the difference between two numbers in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

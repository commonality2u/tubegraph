A personal finance tracking spreadsheet is designed to help users [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This specific spreadsheet utility includes three main tabs: the Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Start Here Tab

The "Start Here" tab provides all necessary instructions for using the spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Budget Tab

The budget tab is where users begin by inputting details related to their income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For each account, users need to specify the amount for each month, corresponding to budgeted expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Key features of the Budget tab:
*   **Account Categorization** Accounts can be categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount Column** The "goal amount" column totals the amounts entered for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This column is formula-driven, meaning changes in monthly entries automatically update the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Adding New Items** When adding new line items, the formula from the "goal amount" column needs to be dragged down to copy it to the new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users can add new rows to the tab by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Transactions Tab

After setting up accounts and budgets in the budget tab, users move to the transactions tab to add new transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

Information to enter in the Transactions tab:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   **Details of the transaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   **Category** Users select a category from the accounts previously added in the budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Income/Expense Type** Column E is a formula-driven property that automatically specifies whether a transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This formula should be dragged down for new line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount** The amount related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Dashboard Tab

The dashboard section provides an analysis of all added income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Analysis and filtering options:
*   **Controls** The dashboard's analysis is controlled by filters for category, period, and type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Summary Overview** Users can view a summary of total income amount, total expense amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Income Overview** This section specifies different sources of income earned during a filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview** Similar to the income overview, this shows a breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview** Displays income, expense, and net balance details for each month where transactions were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout** A status callout indicates whether expenses have been exceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Filtering Examples** Users can filter to see total income for an entire period (e.g., 2023) across all accounts or drill down to individual sources of income, such as salary, updating the entire view accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

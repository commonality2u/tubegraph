The [[notion_expense_tracker_overview | business expense tracker]] is designed to help keep track of business expenses under one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template offers various ways to [[customizing_expense_tracking_for_personal_needs | customize]] its features to suit specific business needs.

## Defining and Modifying Expense Categories

The tracker includes a section for [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | expense categories]] where users can define different types of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Predefined categories are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **Modifying Predefined Categories**
    To modify or change an existing category, users can click on the category name and then click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Changing Subcategories**
    To change a subcategory within a main category, simply click on the pencil icon next to it to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**
    New expense categories can be added by clicking on the "new" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Setting Budgeted Amounts

For each [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | expense category]], a budgeted amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any amount set here will automatically be reflected in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The expenses overview displays total incurred expenses, set budgeted expenses, and a percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, changing the advertising budget from $100 to $5,000 will automatically update the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Managing Transaction Accounts

In the transaction section, users can input expenses by selecting a date, adding a description, and choosing an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Users can edit and add any of their predefined accounts to customize how transactions are categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

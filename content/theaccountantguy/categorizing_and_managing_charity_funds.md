This article explains how to utilize a [[setting_up_a_charity_donation_tracker_in_notion | charity donation tracker]] to [[tracking_and_analyzing_donations_over_time | track all your donations]] towards charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is divided into three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Donation Funds Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your charitable contributions.

### Fund Setup

The fund setup allows for the organization and definition of various donation categories and individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

#### Setting Up Categories

Donations are initially divided into broad categories such as Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These categories can be edited or new ones can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. To add a new category, slide the bottom slider to the right and click the plus icon to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This flexibility in [[setting_budget_categories | setting budget categories]] is similar to [[customizing_fund_categories_and_goals_in_notion | customizing fund categories]] in other financial tracking systems.

#### Adding and Managing Funds

Under each category, specific funds are set up, such as American Red Cross, WHO, and Care funds for Health; Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and The Rainforest Foundation for Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
To add a new fund, click the "add funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. New funds are initially unclassified and can be moved into an existing category via the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Funds can also be deleted by clicking the three dots and selecting delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

#### Editing Fund Details

Once a fund is classified, its details can be edited using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Key details to input include:
*   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Opening balance**: Donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted donation**: The desired total donation for this specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Start date**: When you began donating to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Target date**: The end goal date by when you aim to reach the targeted donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Tracking Recent Donations

This section, located at the bottom of the dashboard, tracks individual donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

#### Monthly Breakdown

All donations are split month-wise, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Each donation entry includes the date, description, period (month/year), and the specific fund it contributes to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. New periods can be created if donating on a new date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A new donation line item can be automatically added with the current date by clicking the "add donation" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

#### Recommended vs. Actual Contribution

When selecting a fund for a donation, a "recommend" figure appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This figure represents the monthly contribution needed from the fund's start date to reach its targeted amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Users then input the actual amount of donations made for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

A checkmark appears if the actual contribution meets or exceeds the recommended amount, indicating sufficient contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Conversely, a crossmark signifies that the donation is falling short of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This system helps assess if you are contributing enough for a specific fund each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Quarterly Overview

The quarterly overview provides a summary of donations made for each month, grouped into different quarters (Q1: January-March, Q2: April-June, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### Visualizing Progress

For each month, the total donations made are compared against the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Red color**: Signifies that the donation is falling short of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Green color**: Indicates that enough donations have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Blue color**: Means the total donation is equal to the donation requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

The total donations for all months combined within a quarter are also displayed at the top of each quarter section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Donations Overview by Fund

This view provides a specific fund-wise overview of donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

#### Detailed Fund Performance

*   **Target amount** and **percentage reached** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Months remaining** until the targeted end date, which automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Contribution required per month**: The total contribution needed monthly from the start date to reach the targeted donation by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Total contribution amount** for each specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Summary

The summary section provides a quick overall view of your donation progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Total donation required**: The summation of all individual fund donation requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Total donation made so far** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

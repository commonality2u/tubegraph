To [[creating_number_properties_in_notion | assign properties to numbers]] within a Notion database, you first need to set up a database and then define specific columns as number properties. This process enables you to perform calculations, such as [[subtracting_numbers_in_notion | subtracting numbers in Notion]], between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Database Setup
Before assigning number properties, a database must be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
1.  Type a forward slash (`/`) in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  Type "database" to view a list of database options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  Once the database is created, the initial column will typically be a "Title" property, which can be used to describe the operation being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Assigning Number Properties
After creating the database, you need to add new properties (columns) and set their type to "Number". These will hold the numerical values you wish to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, you might create "Number One" and "Number Two" properties.

## Using Number Properties in Formulas
Once number properties are assigned, you can use [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas in Notion]] to perform operations between them. The transcript highlights two methods for finding the difference between two numbers: using the `subtract` operator and using the minus (`-`) sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Method 1: Using the `subtract` operator
The `subtract` operator is a formula designed to find the difference between two numerical inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   It takes two numbers as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   For example, if you have "Number One" and "Number Two" as your properties, the formula would reference these inputs to calculate the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Method 2: Using the Minus Sign (`-`)
Alternatively, you can directly use the minus sign (`-`) within a formula to achieve the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This method also calculates the difference between two given numbers within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

By assigning number properties and then applying these formulas, you can efficiently find the difference between numerical values stored in your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Wizzygen is a platform designed to create AI-generated content directly within your [[notion_for_relationship_management | Notion workspace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A fundamental aspect of using Wizzygen involves establishing and managing connections between the platform and your Notion databases and pages.

## Defining the Connections Database

To begin using Wizzygen, you first need to define a "connection database" within the settings tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This database serves as the central repository for all the different connections you build between Wizzygen and your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Steps to Define the Connections Database:

1.  **Access Settings**: Click on the gear icon on the home screen or "Settings" on the sidebar to access the settings tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Open Template**: Locate the "Connection Database" field and click on the icon to its right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This action opens a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
3.  **Duplicate Template**: Duplicate this template onto your local Notion workspace by clicking "Duplicate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Select your desired workspace and click "Add to Private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This automatically duplicates the connections database to your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
4.  **Copy URL**: Once duplicated, copy the URL of this new connections database from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
5.  **Paste into Wizzygen Settings**: Paste the copied URL into the "Connection Database" field in Wizzygen's settings tab <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
6.  **Connect Integration**: Navigate back to your duplicated Notion connections database. Click the three dots in the top right corner, scroll down to "Connections," type "Wizzygen," select the internal connection you created, and click "Confirm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This step ensures the connections database itself is linked to your Wizzygen integration.

## Creating New Connections

Wizzygen currently supports creating AI content on both Notion databases and Notion pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Steps to Create a New Connection:

1.  **Initiate Creation**: Click on the "Create" button within Wizzygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
2.  **Name and Type**: Provide a name for your connection and select whether it's a "Notion database" or "Notion page" from the dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
3.  **Duplicate Template (Page/Database)**:
    *   For a **Notion Page**: Click the provided link to open a sample blank page. Duplicate this page to your local Notion workspace, similar to the connections database duplication process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   For a **Notion Database**: Click the provided link to open a sample Notion database template. Duplicate this template to your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This template includes necessary settings for optimal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
4.  **Connect Integration (Page/Database)**: Once duplicated, go to the Notion page or database you just created. Click the three dots in the top right corner, select "Connect," search for "Wizzygen," and choose your integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This links the specific page or database to Wizzygen. This step only needs to be done once per page/database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
5.  **Copy URL**: Copy the URL of the Notion page or database from your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
6.  **Paste into Wizzygen**: Paste the URL into the designated field in Wizzygen and click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
7.  **Define AI Prompt**: On the next screen, you can define your AI prompt. This prompt instructs the AI on what content to generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   For Notion Pages, the AI will generate content directly onto that page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   For Notion Databases, you can input different titles or topics in rows, and the AI will generate content for each checked row based on your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Ensure the checkbox next to each row is ticked for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Viewing and Managing Connections

Wizzygen provides a dedicated "Connections" tab to manage all your created connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Accessing Connections**: Navigate to the "Connections" tab to see a list of all connections you've established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Viewing Details**: Clicking on a specific connection within the tab will show its settings and the linked Notion page or database, including the generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Sorting and Filtering**: You can sort and filter connections directly from this tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Resuming Work**: Select any connection from the "Connections" tab to jump directly back into its "Create" view, allowing you to pick up where you left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Deleting Connections**: To delete a connection, go to the "Connections" tab, click the three dots next to the desired connection, and select "Delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This removes the connection from Wizzygen's stored list.
*   **Notion Connections Database**: All created connections are also stored in the connections database you initially set up in Notion, allowing for further management (sorting, deleting) directly within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> All settings, including connection details and API keys, are saved in your local storage. This means the data is not stored externally on a cloud, enhancing security. You can also clear all stored data by clicking the "Clear" button in the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

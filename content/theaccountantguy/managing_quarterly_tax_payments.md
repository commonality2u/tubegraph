This article explains how to utilize a template to [[using_notion_for_tracking_tax_payments | track all your tax payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, including a [[summary_and_quarterly_payment_analysis | quarterly tax payment section]] where you can view all your tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

The template provides a tax payment summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, displaying three key components: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Accounts

Accounts are used to set up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These allow you to avail input tax credit to set off against tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The summary indicates the number of active revenue and expense sources, updating automatically as you add or remove them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Financials

The Financials section allows you to [[tracking_payment_amounts_and_due_payments | track all your revenue amount and the expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, along with the respective tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** Shows the total revenue earned from services or goods and the corresponding tax payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, $2,000 in services revenue might result in $200 tax payable (10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** Displays the input taxes from purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For instance, $10 in input taxes from purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
All financial figures update automatically once details are entered in the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This section reflects all tax payments you need to make for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes Payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Input Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax Liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

For example, if all current transactions relate to quarter three, the figures for taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability will be updated in quarter three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This provides a [[summary_and_quarterly_payment_analysis | summary]] of your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up your revenue and expense accounts, you can scroll down to the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button to create a new line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The current date is automatically picked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  Select the relevant period (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This helps in [[organizing_transactions_by_period_and_quarter | organizing transactions by period and quarter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the account (e.g., "Goods") from your predefined revenue and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Enter the tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   The tax payable (e.g., $80) is automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   The total revenue amount and tax liability in the "Quarterly Taxes" section at the top are updated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For example, $280 payable, leading to a tax liability of $270 after input tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions

1.  Click the "Add Expense" button to add a new expense line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  Fill in the period (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the account (e.g., "Purchases") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Enter the tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   The input credit (e.g., $50) is automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   The total input credit (e.g., $60 total from all expenses) and overall tax liability (e.g., $220) are updated in the summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also includes a profit/loss section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, which displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Total expenses booked so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

This article explains how to utilize a template for [[tracking_tax_payments_using_notion | tracking tax payments]] and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes a dedicated [[quarterly_cash_flow_overview | quarterly tax payment section]] to review tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary provides a high-level overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This summary displays information across three main categories: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Accounts

The "Accounts" section allows users to set up revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These allow for availing input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

New revenue or expense sources can be added using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The template automatically updates counts for revenue and expense sources as they are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Financials

The "Financials" section enables [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | tracking]] of revenue and expense amounts, along with corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, if $2,000 in revenue is earned from services, it might show a tax payable of $200 (at a 10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Input taxes from purchases, such as $10, are also reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. All these figures automatically update based on data entered in the [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] section at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This section displays all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Input tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

For example, if [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] are booked for Quarter 3, the summary for Quarter 3 will show the updated figures for taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Profit/Loss

The template also includes a profit/loss section, which summarizes:
*   Total revenue earned from all [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Total expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

## Transaction Section

After setting up revenue and expense accounts, users can input individual [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | Transactions]] are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

To add a revenue [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transaction]], click "Add Revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The template automatically pre-fills the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Users then select:
*   **Period:** The quarter to which the revenue belongs (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Account:** The specific revenue account (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The revenue amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate:** The applicable tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Once the tax rate is entered, the tax payable amount is automatically calculated (e.g., $80 for an 8% tax on $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The total tax payable for the quarter and overall tax liability will then be updated in the summary sections at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions

Adding an expense [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transaction]] follows a similar process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. After clicking "Add Expense," the current date is automatically added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Users fill in:
*   **Period:** The relevant quarter (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Account:** The expense account (e.g., Purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The expense amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate:** The tax rate for input credit (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The input credit amount is automatically calculated (e.g., $50 for 10% tax on $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This update will be reflected in the overall input credit and total tax liability in the summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

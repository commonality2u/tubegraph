This article outlines how to [[setting_up_and_connecting_notion_database_for_pdf_creation | connect a database]] and a template in Notion to generate PDF documents, using a boarding pass example.

## Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>

The process involves using a Notion database containing details and a Notion template for the PDF layout to generate PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For instance, to create boarding pass PDFs, you would use a "boarding pass database" and a "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Components Needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>

To generate PDFs:
*   **Database**: A Notion database that holds the details for the documents, such as a "boarding pass database" with passenger information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Template**: A Notion template designed for the final PDF output, like a "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Steps to Connect and Generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

1.  **Initiate Connection**: In the "PDF output" section, type the name of your document, e.g., "boarding pass," into the "connection details" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **[[setting_up_and_connecting_notion_database_for_pdf_creation | Select the Database]]**: Choose the relevant database, such as "boarding pass database," to [[setting_up_and_connecting_notion_database_for_pdf_creation | connect the database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Select the Template**: Pick the appropriate template, like the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to begin loading all the information from both the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once the information is loaded, click "export" to start generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Reviewing the Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

Upon successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   You can click "preview sample" to view the generated PDF, which will contain all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The generated files can then be downloaded and opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Multiple PDF outputs will be generated, each with different details based on the database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This method allows for the efficient generation of PDF documents directly from Notion data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

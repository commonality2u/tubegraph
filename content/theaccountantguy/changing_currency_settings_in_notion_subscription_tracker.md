The Notion subscription tracker allows users to customize the currency displayed in the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This feature enables users to choose different currencies for their tracking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

A quick tutorial on how to change the currency is included within the tracker itself, found underneath the main tracker interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

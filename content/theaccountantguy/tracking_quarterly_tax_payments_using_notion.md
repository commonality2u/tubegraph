From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

This Notion template helps users track all their tax payments, offering a quick overview of tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It's designed to simplify the process of managing tax obligations, especially for quarterly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

Located at the top of the template, the Tax Payment Summary provides a quick overview of three key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
1.  **Accounts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
2.  **Financials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
3.  **Quarterly Taxes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

### Accounts

This section is where you set up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are activities or services that incur tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "Services" and "Goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These allow you to avail input tax credit, which can be set off against your tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can easily add new revenue or expense sources using the "Add Revenue Source" or "Add Expense Source" quick action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A pencil icon allows you to feed in specific details for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The number of revenue and expense sources updates automatically as you add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Financials

This section helps you [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_Notion | track all your revenue and expense amounts]] along with their respective tax liabilities and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   For example, if "Services" generated $2,000 in total revenue with a 10% tax rate, it would show a tax payable of $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   "Purchases" (an expense) might show $10 in input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
All figures in this section automatically update based on the transactions entered at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

After the Financials, the Quarterly Taxes section reflects all tax payments you need to make for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The template displays four quarters, showing the taxes payable, input tax, and overall tax liability for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For instance, if all initial transactions are booked in Quarter Three, only Quarter Three will show updated figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Transaction Section

Below the summary sections, you'll find the transaction view, classified into "Revenue" and "Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

2.  **Select Period**: Choose the relevant quarter (e.g., September falls in Quarter Three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Adding an expense transaction will update the total input credit and overall tax liability in the summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also includes a profit/loss section, which displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

This article outlines the process of [[notion_template_and_database_integration | connecting a database to a template in Notion]] to generate PDF documents, using a boarding pass example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting, ensure you have:
*   A database containing the necessary details (e.g., a boarding pass database with all passenger information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   A template designed for the output document (e.g., a boarding pass template from which the PDF will be generated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Connecting the Database and Template

To initiate the PDF generation process by [[connecting_notion_database_and_templates | connecting a database and a template]]:

1.  **Name the Output**: In the connection details (specifically, the PDF output section), type a name for the output, such as "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Select the Database**: Input the name of the database you wish to connect (e.g., "boarding pass database") to select it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This step is crucial for [[connecting_relational_databases_in_notion | connecting relational databases]].
3.  **Select the Template**: Choose the specific template that will be used for generation (e.g., "boarding pass template") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to begin loading all the information from the selected database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Exporting the Documents

Once the information has finished loading from both the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

*   Click the "export" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The system will then start generating the PDF documents based on the connected data and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Verifying and Accessing Generated PDFs

After the export is complete:

1.  **Confirmation**: A notification will confirm that the export has been successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Preview**: You can click "preview sample" to view the generated PDF, confirming it contains all the correct details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **Download**: The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
4.  **Access**: Once downloaded, the files can be extracted and opened to review the individual PDF outputs, which may vary in name and context depending on the database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This process demonstrates how to effectively utilize PDF output capabilities within Notion to generate documents directly from your [[creating_and_setting_up_a_notion_database | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

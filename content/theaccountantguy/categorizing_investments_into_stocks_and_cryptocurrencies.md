Within an [[setting_up_an_investment_portfolio_tracker_in_notion | Investment Portfolio tracker]], investments are initially divided into core categories such as "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Users can also add their own [[overview_of_fund_categories_and_customization | custom categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Initial Setup of Investments

When starting with the tracker, the investment section is segmented into "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The system provides examples, such as two stocks and one crypto already added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For each investment, users must input the opening balance and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Once initial investment details are entered, the "portfolio" section displays these same investments, classified under their respective groups like "stocks" and "cryptos," along with any additional groups the user creates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This section shows the investment value and available units after all transactions are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Classifying New Investments

When a new investment is added using the "add investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, it initially appears under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

To classify it:
*   Click the pencil icon next to the new investment to open a panel for details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   After typing in the investment name, opening balance, and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, click on the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Select the desired category, such as "stocks" or "crypto," to automatically place it under that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Adding Custom Categories

Users can create new investment categories beyond the default "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Click the plus icon next to the existing categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   A prompt will appear to "create a new group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Type in the desired category name, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   This action automatically adds a new section for that category within the investment view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

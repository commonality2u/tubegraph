This article details how to [[creating_a_database_in_notion_for_calculations | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a [[setting_up_a_database_in_notion | Notion database]] using two distinct formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Database Structure for Product Calculation
A Notion database can be set up to perform product calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The example database used for this purpose includes the following properties:
*   **Name of the Operator** This is the first property and serves as a `Title` property, identifying the operation (e.g., "multiply operator") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Two Numbers** Two separate `Number` properties are assigned to store the input values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Calculation Methods
The product of two numbers can be calculated using two different formula properties in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Method 1: Multiply Operator Formula
This method uses a dedicated formula property named "multiply operator formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The two number properties are provided as inputs to this formula to compute their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Method 2: Multiply Symbol Formula
Another formula property can be used that directly employs the multiply symbol (`*`) placed between the two number properties to perform the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Example
In an example, if the two input numbers are `2` and `3`, both formulas will yield `6` as their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This demonstrates how to calculate the product of two numbers using these two formula types in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

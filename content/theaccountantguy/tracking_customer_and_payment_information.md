The Products Order Tracker is a simple template designed to [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | keep track]] of all products customers are ordering for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is particularly useful for tracking product-related orders placed by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Features

The template incorporates a database with several key fields to [[managing_and_editing_customer_database | manage customer]] and product information:
*   **Product Details**
    *   Product Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing Address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer Phone Number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Order Details**
    *   Payment Sources: Specifies how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   Gift Item Status: Indicates if the product is being sent as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   Order Amount: The total amount for the order placed by the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Order Summary

At the top of the tracker, an order summary provides a quick overview of key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Number of Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers** who have placed an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Gift Recommendation Percentage**: This percentage shows how many customers are ordering products as gift items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This value updates dynamically with changes in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Payment Sources Breakdown

The template also includes a section detailing payment sources, showing how many customers are paying through specific methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Supported payment methods include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
*   Debit Card
*   PayPal
*   Credit Card
*   Other sources

Each payment source reflects the number of customers using it and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

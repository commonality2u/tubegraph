The Notion Formula Chatbot requires an OpenAI API key to function and allow users to interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This chatbot is designed to assist [[setting_up_api_keys_in_notion | Notion]] users in deriving precise formulas for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Steps to Generate an API Key

To use the chatbot, you must first generate an OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>:

1.  Click on the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find a link that redirects you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  Once on the OpenAI platform, navigate to "API Keys" which is usually found on the left side menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  Enter a name for your key (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  **Immediately copy the generated key.** Once you close the window, you will not be able to view this key again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
6.  Paste the copied key into the designated field within the chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A message will confirm that the API key has been successfully entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

If the left panel for entering API keys is not visible, click the arrow on the left side of the chat window to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## OpenAI Free Credit and Model Selection

Upon creating a new OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit that can be used for testing the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This credit is limited to the [[using_gpt_models_with_the_chatbot | GPT 3.5 Turbo]] model, which is an older version and less accurate than newer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

For better and more accurate results, especially with more complex prompts, it is recommended to use [[using_gpt_models_with_the_chatbot | GPT 4]] (specifically GPT 4106 preview) if you are on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The demonstrations in the video were conducted using the [[using_gpt_models_with_the_chatbot | GPT 3.5 Turbo]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. You can choose your preferred [[selection_of_ai_engines_and_api_key_configuration | GPT model]] from a dropdown menu after entering your API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

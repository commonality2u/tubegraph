The [[debt_tracker | Debt Payment Tracker]], developed by Anat Biswal ("the accountant guy"), is a tool designed to help users pay off their debts efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It provides a structured way to track various debt details and monitor payoff progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The [[debt_tracker | debt overview section]] categorizes debts, typically into annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Key details displayed for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Amount**: The amount paid per installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The specified interest rate for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first date of installment payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Managing Debt Categories
Users can add new payment categories by clicking an "add a group" button, allowing for custom installment periods like "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The tracker comes with necessary pre-added payment schedules, including options for quarterly and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be easily moved between different repayment schedules, and the repayment schedule and other related details will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debts
New debts can be quickly added by clicking the "added details" button, initially appearing under a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once moved to a specific frequency, details can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited by clicking the debt field, with changes automatically updating across all relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress (Summary Section)

The debt payoff progress section, referred to as the [[summary_section_in_notion_debt_tracker | summary section]], provides a quick overview of all loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It reflects:
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: Calculated from installments recorded in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: The percentage of total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A quick reference to the overall debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount**: The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount**: The total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The tracker automatically splits each debt repayment into interest and principal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. All these metrics update automatically as new payment details are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is where all [[tracking_debt_payments_and_liabilities | debt payments and liabilities]] are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Paid Installment Section**: Reflects all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with the latest month at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking**: A checkmark indicates if an amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>; unticking it moves the entry to the unpaid column, and ticking it moves it to the paid installment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Payment Details**: Columns include:
    *   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

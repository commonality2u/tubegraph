## Dashboard Views

The main savings funds dashboard provides two distinct views to track progress:

*   **Savings Target** This view allows users to set different saving funds and their corresponding target or "goal" amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview** This view provides a summary of how much has been saved against the total targeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays the total savings, the targeted saving amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

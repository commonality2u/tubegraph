The travel expense tracker, presented by Anath Biswal (The Accountant Guy), allows users to [[Utilizing Notion features for detailed travel expense management | keep track of all travel expenses]] and [[Creating and monitoring budgets | plan ahead]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A key feature is the ability to [[Setting and managing budgets for expenses | set and manage budgeted amounts]] for various travel-related expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Accounts and Budgeted Amounts

The tracker categorizes expenses under primary headings such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Within these categories, specific expense sources are created, each with its own budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources
To add a new expense source:
1.  Navigate to the "Accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  Click the "Add expense source" button, which automatically adds a new source to the "Travel" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon next to the newly added source to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
4.  Rename the expense source (e.g., "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
5.  Set the budgeted amount for this specific expense (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Moving and Editing Existing Expense Sources
An expense source can be moved to a different category, such as "Meals," by clicking the three dots next to it and selecting the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Existing expense sources can also be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Adding New Categories
To create a completely new expense category (group), click the plus sign on the right side of the "Accounts" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Tracking and Analyzing Expenses Against Budgets

After [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | setting budgeted amounts]], the "Expenses" section provides a detailed view of actual spending versus the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Detailed Expense Tracking
This section shows:
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Budgeted expense set for that specific item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Percentage of actual spending relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

**Example Scenarios:**
*   **Exceeding Budget:** If flight expenses incurred are $2,000 against a budgeted $1,000, it shows 200% spent and is indicated in red, signaling an overspend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Within Budget:** If breakfast expenses incurred are $100 against a budgeted $300, it shows 33% spent and is indicated in green, indicating that spending is within the allocated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This visual classification helps users quickly see where their expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary of Budgeted and Actual Expenses

The "Summary" section offers a comprehensive overview of financial performance for all travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

This summary includes:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage reflecting the total expenses divided by the total budgeted expense, indicating the overall spending against the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For instance, 59% means 59% of the total budgeted amount has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

By [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | tracking and analyzing actual versus budgeted expenses]], users can gain a clear understanding of their spending patterns and make informed decisions for future planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Setting Up Bill Payment Reminders

The system allows you to create and manage recurring bill notifications. An example shown is a Wi-Fi bill for $3,000 due on September 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the dropdown menu and select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
2.  Enter the name of the bill, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill amount, for instance, $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Navigate back, click the dropdown again, select the three dots, and set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
5.  Choose the frequency, such as "every month" for a mobile bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
6.  Specify the exact time and day you wish to receive the notification, for example, 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
7.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the system will automatically send a notification to your WhatsApp at the specified time and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

This system relies on automation, specifically using Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for setting up this automation are included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once the automation is configured, you will consistently receive notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. If a template is set for recurring notifications, you will automatically start receiving them every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The notification delivery is prompt, typically taking less than a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

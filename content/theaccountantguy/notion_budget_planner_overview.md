This article outlines how to utilize a [[creating_a_budget_planner_using_notion | monthly budget planner]] in [[notion_overview | Notion]] to begin [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]] for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system, presented by An Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, provides various views and methods for [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | tracking expenses]] and managing financial performance.

## Core Views

The [[creating_a_budget_planner_using_notion | Notion budget planner]] includes four primary views at the outset:
*   Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Summary of all booked expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview
This view presents a breakdown of different expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For each category, it displays:
*   The total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   The budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   The percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview
The monthly overview organizes all expenses in a monthly format, allowing users to see all expenses at a glance for each categorized month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, the yearly overview presents the same information but in an annual format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Summary
The summary section provides a complete expense overlook in a yearly format, where all expenses are grouped to give a comprehensive view of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Utilizing the Expense Details Database

To use the planner, all information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database helps in calculating all incurred day-to-day expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click on "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The month will automatically adjust based on the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Custom periods can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the expense category (e.g., "utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can add their own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  Enter an expense code to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Input the expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Setting Up a Budget
The "budget amount" column is used at the start of the month to [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | set budget]] for a specific expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
To set a budget:
1.  Select the date (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period (e.g., February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> and the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
4.  Select the category (e.g., "food category") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For budgeting, the expense name and category name remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  Set the expense code (e.g., category and month, such as "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  Input the budget amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once budget and expense information is entered, all figures in the top views are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, providing real-time insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

The [[creating_a_budget_planner_using_notion | Notion budget planner]] allows for in-depth analysis of financial situations:
*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing all booked transactions for that period, along with details like the amount and whether it was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This offers a quick glance at the month's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Clicking on the year provides a similar view, displaying budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expenses as a percentage, and the budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View**: Users can view how much expense has been booked for a particular category, including expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status, along with associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: This allows for tracking specific category expenses for a particular month against the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This system facilitates [[using_notion_for_financial_management | financial management]] by enabling users to track transactions and understand their financial performance through the four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] is designed for Notion users who need help deriving specific formulas for their use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This chatbot assists in generating the exact formulas required within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Configuration
Before you can begin [[interacting_with_the_chatbot | interacting with the chatbot]], you must first place your OpenAI API key in the designated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Once the API key is entered, you will need to select your preferred GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### [[generating_an_openai_api_key | Generating an OpenAI API Key]]
To use the chatbot, generating an OpenAI key is the first prerequisite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:02">[04:01:02]</a>. A question mark icon is available which provides a direct link to generate the OpenAI key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:04">[04:05:04]</a>. Clicking this link redirects you to the OpenAI platform where you can find "API Keys" on the left menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:04">[04:13:04]</a>.

Follow these steps to create a new secret key:
1.  Click on "API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:04">[04:19:04]</a>.
2.  Select "create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:04">[04:22:04]</a>.
3.  Fill in the details and click "create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:04">[04:25:04]</a>.
4.  Copy the generated key immediately, as it cannot be viewed again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:04">[04:41:04]</a>.
5.  Paste this key into the chatbot's interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:04">[04:51:04]</a>. A confirmation message will appear indicating the API key has been entered successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>.

When you create an OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit that can be used for testing, though this credit is limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:04">[05:06:04]</a>.

### [[selection_of_ai_engines_and_api_key_configuration | Selection of AI Engines and API Key Configuration]]
After entering the API key, you can select a GPT model from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:04">[05:35:04]</a>. The chatbot offers two main models:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:04">[05:38:04]</a>: This is an older model and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:04">[05:43:04]</a>. It is available for users on the free OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:04">[05:59:04]</a>. The demonstration video primarily used this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:04">[06:07:04]</a>.
*   **GPT 4-106 Preview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:04">[05:38:04]</a>: This model offers better and more accurate results for prompts and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:04">[05:53:04]</a>. It is recommended for users on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:04">[05:49:04]</a>.

## [[interacting_with_the_chatbot | Interacting with the Chatbot]]
The chatbot interface is divided into three sections: Info, Chat, and Give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. The "Chat" section is where users can [[interacting_with_the_chatbot | interact with the bot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

Examples of interaction:
*   **Adding two numbers**: When asked "What is the formula to add two numbers in Notion?", the chatbot responded with `property a + property B`, explaining that 'property A' and 'property B' are the numbers to be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Time difference between dates**: A query for "What is the formula to find the difference between the birth date and today's date in years in Notion?" resulted in a response suggesting the `dateBetween` formula, specifying the 'years' unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>.
*   **If condition**: For a more complex question like "If number one is greater than number two, I want to generate number one as the output, otherwise I want to generate number two as the output," the chatbot provided an accurate `if` condition formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a>.

The chatbot provides instant responses with explanations of how to implement the formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. Sometimes, more precise prompting with examples or references may be needed to achieve the desired response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:04">[03:38:04]</a>.

## [[customizing_chatbot_interface | Customizing Chatbot Interface]]
The chatbot offers several customization options:

*   **User Image**: Users can upload an image, which will update the user icon next to their questions, making interactions more personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:04">[06:13:04]</a>. Clicking the cross icon reverts to the original user image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:04">[06:58:04]</a>.
*   **Theme and Font**: The color theme can be changed from dark to light by clicking the three dots on the right, going to "settings," and selecting "App Theme Colors and Font" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:04">[07:27:04]</a>. Options include Light, Dark, or System settings, allowing users to customize colors and font family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:04">[07:40:04]</a>.
*   **Panel Visibility**: If the left panel (for API keys and GPT models) is not visible, it can be opened by clicking the arrow on the left side of the chat window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:04">[08:11:04]</a>. This is particularly useful for smartphone or other device users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:04">[08:22:04]</a>.

## Additional Features and Support
The chatbot also includes:
*   **Info Section**: Provides details about the chatbot and embeds a video explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:04">[08:35:04]</a>.

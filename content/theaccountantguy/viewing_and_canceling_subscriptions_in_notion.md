The Notion Subscription Expenses Tracker allows users to monitor and manage all their subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>.

### Categories View
Within the categories view, subscriptions are divided into "Active" and "Cancel subscription" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20"></a>. For each subscription, the following details are displayed:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>
*   Billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29"></a>

### Expenses Section
The expenses section is organized into different categories, such as "Infotainment," "Education," and "Music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43"></a>. Users can add new groups or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52"></a>.
Under each classification, you'll find:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05"></a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06"></a>
*   Percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>

## Transaction Section
The "Transaction section" is where detailed expenses for subscriptions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"></a>.

### Views
*   **Active Subscriptions View:** Shows all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44"></a>.
*   **Cancelled Subscriptions View:** Displays subscriptions that have been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a>.

Subscriptions in these views are organized by month, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55"></a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month is also shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00"></a>.

### Subscription Details
For each entry in the transaction section, users can see and modify:
*   **Status:** A checkbox indicates if the subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05"></a>.
*   **Subscription Account:** Select from a list of subscriptions added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13"></a>.
*   **Billing Period:** This value is pulled from the setting defined at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21"></a>.
*   **Payment Date:** A date picker allows selection of the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>.
*   **Amount:** Input the subscription expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32"></a>.
*   **Renewal Date:** This is automatically calculated based on the payment date and billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35"></a>. For example, a monthly Netflix subscription paid on September 30th would show an October 30th renewal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.

## Canceling a Subscription
To cancel a subscription:
1.  Navigate to the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"></a>.
2.  Simply click on the status checkbox next to the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>.
3.  This action automatically moves the subscription to the "Cancel status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05"></a>.
4.  Cancelled subscriptions, like a YouTube subscription marked for cancellation, will be reflected in the "Cancel subscription" view within the overview section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a>.

A Notion-based credit card expenses tracker can be utilized to [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | keep track of all your credit card payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tracker offers comprehensive overviews, detailed expense tracking, budget management, and timely repayment notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker

The tracker provides several key sections to manage credit card finances:
*   **Credit Cards Overview** Shows the total amount due, repaid amount, and balance due for each credit card added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** Displays amounts due, repaid, and balance due for each month, customizable as per user requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Provides total amounts due, repaid, and balance due across different years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Expense Detail Section** Lists all individual expenses that have been entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **[[how_to_build_an_expense_tracker_in_notion | Expenses Overview]]** Summarizes expenses by category, comparing actual expenses to budgeted amounts and indicating an "under budget" or "over budget" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This is crucial for [[creating_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | creating and managing budgets in Notion]] and overall [[budget_management_with_notion | budget management with Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Notification Section** Displays when the next repayment is due and the number of days remaining until that date for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This acts as an automated [[setting_up_invoice_payment_reminders_using_notion | invoice payment reminder]] specifically for credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

To begin using the tracker, expenses must be logged under the "Expense Details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
For each entry, you can specify:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   **Expense Details** (e.g., "opening balance") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Period** (e.g., month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Credit Card** associated with the expense; new cards can be added by typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Category** for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Expense Amount** in the designated column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Repayment Amount** when a payment is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance Due** for any carried-forward balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Receipt** for associating bills or receipts with expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

All entered details automatically update the overview sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This process facilitates [[setting_up_income_and_expenses_in_notion | setting up income and expenses in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Tracking Budgets in the Expenses Overview

The [[how_to_build_an_expense_tracker_in_notion | Expenses Overview]] section allows users to track their spending against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   It displays the total expense incurred for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Users can set a **budgeted amount** for each expense category by clicking on the budget amount field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   The system automatically updates and shows whether the spending is "under budget" or "over budget" based on the comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. For example, an expense of $5,300 against a $5,000 budget will display "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This feature is a core component of [[creating_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | creating and managing budgets in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Setting and Tracking Repayment Notifications

The notification section is vital for managing credit card debt by providing timely repayment reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Users can set their **next repayment date** by clicking on the date field in this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   For each credit card, the tracker will display **how many days are pending** until the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   This proactive notification helps users track their credit card payments and ensure debts are paid on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This functionality is similar to [[setting_up_invoice_payment_reminders_using_notion | setting up invoice payment reminders using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> and can be adapted for purposes like [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker_in_notion | setting up a customer payments tracker in Notion]] or [[using_notion_for_rental_payments_tracking | using Notion for rental payments tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Views

The tracker is highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Credit card information can be edited or new credit cards added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Expense categories can be added or modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Summarization Views:**
    *   Clicking on a specific **period** (e.g., month) opens a new window showing transactions for that period, including dates, details, amounts, and tags (green for repayment, no tag for expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Clicking on a **year** provides similar detailed transaction information for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   Clicking on a specific **credit card** displays all transactions related to that card, including its status and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Clicking on an **expense category** shows all expenses attributed to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

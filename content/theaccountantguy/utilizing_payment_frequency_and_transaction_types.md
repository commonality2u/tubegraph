This guide outlines how to effectively use payment frequency and transaction types within the business cash flow template to gain a comprehensive understanding of your financial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Payment Frequency

Payment frequency specifies how often you expect to receive or make payments for a particular item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for tracking recurring [[analyzing_income_frequency_with_databases | income]] and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.

### Setting Up Payment Frequencies
You can specify the payment frequency for any asset where periodical payments or receipts are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a>. For example, "interest income" can be classified with a "quarterly" payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>. The template offers several predefined frequencies, which can be selected from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>.

## Transaction Types: Inflow and Outflow

Transaction types denote the direction of cash flow within your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:23">[07:54:23]</a>.

*   **Inflow**: Indicates that cash is coming into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:41">[08:01:41]</a>. All [[adding_and_managing_transactions | income transactions]] are considered inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:10">[08:04:10]</a>.
*   **Outflow**: Indicates that cash is leaving the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. All expense transactions are considered outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:44">[08:08:44]</a>.

For assets and liabilities, you must assess whether the cash is entering or exiting your account to determine if it's an inflow or outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:53">[08:20:53]</a>. For example, a sales revenue transaction is an inflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:37">[08:31:37]</a>.

## Business Activity Types

The template categorizes transactions into three main business activities, providing a quick overview of your business's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>:

1.  **Operating Activities**: These include all activities related to the core operations of your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:39">[03:58:39]</a>. Examples include salary payments, receipt of revenue, and day-to-day business affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06">[04:01:06]</a>. Any activity not classified as investing or financing falls under operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:58">[07:46:58]</a>.
2.  **Investing Activities**: This category covers transactions related to specific investments made by the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:35">[04:12:35]</a>. This includes stock investments, mutual fund investments, or other business investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:33">[04:16:33]</a>.
3.  **Financing Activities**: These activities involve raising loans or debt to operate your business, as well as loan repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:53">[04:33:53]</a>.

These categories help organize your cash flow by its underlying purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:11">[07:16:11]</a>.

The Notion Formula Chatbot, designed to assist Notion users in finding the correct formulas for their use cases, requires an OpenAI API key to function. This key enables interaction with the chatbot and access to its AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.

## Generating an OpenAI API Key

To generate an OpenAI API key:
1.  Navigate to the OpenAI platform by clicking the question mark within the chatbot interface, which provides a direct link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05"></a>.
2.  On the OpenAI platform, locate and click on "API Keys" in the left-hand navigation menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17"></a>.
3.  Select "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21"></a>.
4.  Fill in any required details, such as a name for the key, and then click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25"></a>. For example, a key might be named "test key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35"></a>.
5.  Once the key is generated, copy it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a>. It is crucial to save this key in a secure location, as it will not be visible again once the generation window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46"></a>.

## Utilizing the API Key

After generating and copying the API key, paste it into the designated field within the Notion Formula Chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>. A message will confirm that the API key has been successfully entered, allowing you to proceed with using the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57"></a>. This process is part of [[configuring_api_keys_for_notion_integration | configuring API keys for Notion integration]].

### Free Credit and Model Selection
When a new OpenAI account is created, it typically receives a $5 free credit, which can be used to test the chatbot's functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>. This free credit is generally limited to the [[selecting_and_configuring_ai_engines_such_as_gemini_and_gpt | GPT]] 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16"></a>.

Once the API key is entered, you can select your preferred [[selecting_and_configuring_ai_engines_such_as_gemini_and_gpt | GPT]] model from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>. The available models typically include:
*   **[[selecting_and_configuring_ai_engines_such_as_gemini_and_gpt | GPT]] 3.5 Turbo**: An older model that is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43"></a>. This model is accessible with the $5 free credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00"></a>.
*   **[[selecting_and_configuring_ai_engines_such_as_gemini_and_gpt | GPT]] 4-106 Preview**: A newer, more accurate model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46"></a>. This model requires a paid OpenAI plan for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49"></a>.

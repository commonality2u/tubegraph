This Notion template provides a simple solution for [[using_notion_for_home_inventory_tracking | tracking home inventory]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It's designed to help users keep a clear overview of their household items, consumption, and purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Template Sections

The template is divided into several key sections to provide a comprehensive view of inventory and related transactions:

### Financial Overview
On the left side of the template, users can find a summary of their inventory-related finances:
*   **Total Estimated Purchases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   **Total Purchases Made** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   **Difference** between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Total Percentage of Purchases** made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

### Inventory Structure
The right side of the template features three main sections for organizing and monitoring inventory details:

#### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up different categories for their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples provided include "Dairy and eggs," "Medicines," and "Fruits and veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Under each main category, users can list specific subcategories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and specify their estimated budgeted purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

#### Inventory Overview
The Inventory Overview provides a summary of items under each subcategory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Total Purchases Made** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   **Consumption Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   **Availability Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   **Percentage of Total Units Consumed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

#### Transaction Section
This section is crucial for recording all inventory movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can specify transactions, such as:
*   **Purchases**: Entering an item like "cheese purchase" allows users to record the specific inventory item purchased and the amount of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Consumption**: Users can add entries for items being consumed, specifying the item (e.g., "cheese") and the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

All transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template, providing real-time tracking of inventory availability and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

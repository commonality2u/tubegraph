## Setting Up Your Notion Net Worth Tracker

### 1. Set Your Net Worth Goal
Begin by setting your net worth goal in the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This value automatically updates other database calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### 2. Add and Edit Accounts
The account section comes with default accounts, but users can add new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

#### Adding a New Account
To add a new account, scroll down within each category (Income, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities) and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When adding an account, fill in the following details:
*   **Name**: E.g., "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**:
    *   Left blank for income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Used for assets and liabilities to represent the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Assign a tag to categorize the account (e.g., "Other Income," "Bills," "Savings," "Debt Payments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Users can create new categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Define how often the payment or receipt occurs (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**:
    *   Used specifically for investments, representing the number of units held at the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Left blank for income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**:
    *   Set as "Investments" for investment accounts (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   Left blank for other account types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

#### Editing an Existing Account
Click the pencil icon next to an account to open the edit window and modify its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. All accounts are customizable and can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Managing Transactions
The transactions section has four primary views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All View" that combines all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Entering a Transaction
Click the "New" button within any transaction view to add a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Date**: Select the transaction date; it automatically sorts into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Description**: Briefly describe the transaction (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Category**: This will be pre-filled based on the view (e.g., Income, Expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

*   **Transaction Type**:
    *   **Inflow**: For income transactions or when obtaining more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Also for selling assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: For expense transactions or when repaying debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Also for buying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Document**: Attach any relevant receipts or bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Understanding the Summary Section

Once all accounts and transactions are entered, the summary section provides key financial insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Finances View
This view shows the current standing of all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion relative to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Net Worth View
This section computes and displays five key statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:

1.  **Net Worth Goal**: The goal amount set in the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This value is editable and updates calculations automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The gap between the net worth goal and the total net worth achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: Represents the closing net worth value minus the opening net worth. Opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows what percentage of the net worth goal has been accomplished by the current total net worth (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are continuously added, the net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

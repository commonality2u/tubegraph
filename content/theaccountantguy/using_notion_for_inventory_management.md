This article outlines how to [[using_notion_for_business_tracking | utilize a Notion template]] to track inventory for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The template is designed to provide a comprehensive view of inventory, including setup, portfolio status, and transaction tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio

The inventory portfolio is the primary section, offering three distinct views: Inventory Setup, Inventory Portfolio, and Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Inventory Setup

This section allows for the classification and detailed setup of inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

*   **Classifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
    *   Raw Materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Work in Progress (WIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
    *   Finished Goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   **Key Data Points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
    *   **Opening Balance:** The starting financial balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   **Opening Number of Units:** The initial count of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
    *   **Valuation Principle:** Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), or WSC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can leave this as default if unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   **Reorder Level:** The threshold level of units at which inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, a reorder level of 60 units for wheat or 10 units for corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a specific inventory item compared to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Adding Inventory:** New inventory items can be added by clicking the "add inventory" button, which places them into a "no classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. From there, items can be dragged and dropped into their specific category (e.g., Work in Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Values can then be inputted using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Inventory Portfolio (View)

This view provides a snapshot of current inventory levels after transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Inventory Value:** The financial value of the inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available:** The total units remaining after all purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level:** Alerts are provided based on the set reorder level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **"Low Stock"**: Indicates that units have dropped below the reorder level, prompting a need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For example, if wheat has a reorder level of 60 units but only 30 units are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   **"Available in Surplus"**: Means units are well above the reorder level, and no immediate reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For instance, corn with 70 units available against a reorder level of 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Inventory Status

This section tracks the current location or stage of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Statuses**: Includes categories such as "In Transit," "In Progress," and "Not Sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Statuses can be edited or new ones added by clicking the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Tracking**: The status indicates how many inventory items are currently in each category. For example, "In Transit" signaling one item means one purchase or sale is currently in transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. An example is a corn purchase of 50 units for 500, made on August 26th, which is currently "in transit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Items can be moved between statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section details all inventory transactions, including purchases, sales, and corresponding profit/loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases

Records all inventory acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

*   **Date Tracking**: Transactions are divided by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Dates can be automatically bifurcated into different monthly sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Details**: Users can add a description, select the specific inventory account (e.g., wheat, corn, bread), input the number of units, and specify the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The total purchase price automatically populates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status**: A status can be assigned to each purchase transaction, which can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button**: The "buy inventory" button automatically adds a purchase transaction to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Sales

Functions similarly to the purchases section, allowing users to record all inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This contributes to [[sales_receipts_tracking_using_notion | sales receipts tracking]] and [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | financial tracking]].

### Profit and Loss

Calculates the profitability of each sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This feature supports [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] and [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | financial tracking]].

*   **Calculation**: For each sale, the purchase price (or manufacturing cost for finished goods) must be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Example**: If bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, the template automatically calculates a profit of $30 per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If 30 units are sold, the total profit would be $900 ($30 x 30 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

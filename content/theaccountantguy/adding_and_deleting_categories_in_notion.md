The Notion expense tracker features a category section at the top, typically starting with three distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These categories are entirely customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The template can be used for tracking any expenses, whether personal or business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The template provides a summary section that shows the total budgeted amount, actual expenses, the difference, and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The Notion asset planner template includes a dedicated section for tracking asset maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This template is designed to provide comprehensive management for various aspects of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Operational Management Section

A key part of the asset planner is the operational management section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, which encompasses several crucial areas:

### Asset Details
This area allows users to track fundamental information about each asset, including its ID, name, and type, among other categorized details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Maintenance Section
Within the operational management section, a specific maintenance section is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This area covers all pertinent [[operational_management_of_assets_using_notion | maintenance details]], such as the maintenance ID and asset ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Financial Details
The template also provides a financial section to track the current value, depreciation method, and depreciation rate of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This supports [[managing_asset_financials_in_notion | managing asset financials in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Asset Performance
An asset performance section is included to monitor asset performance as they are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

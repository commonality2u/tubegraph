The paycheck budget tracker allows users to track their paycheck payments and budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool helps ensure you stay on top of your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Overview of Expense Categories

The tracker includes an "Account section" where users can add their own expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. By default, expenses are organized under three main "heads" or categories:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Once expenses are added, users can [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | set a budgeted amount]] for each one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The tracker also provides a summary section on the left, showing total budgeted expenses, total incurred expenses, the difference, and the percentage of budgeted expense spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Customizing Categories

Users have the flexibility to [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | customize these categories]] (or "heads") to better suit their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. To change a category, simply click on the existing head, [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | set your own category name]], and click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The category will automatically be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Expenses

The tracker offers quick action buttons to streamline [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | expense management]]:
*   **Add transaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>: This button automatically adds a new transaction with the current date, allowing users to feed in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add expense Source** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>: Clicking this button automatically adds a new expense source, initially placing it under "fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Users can then click the three dots next to the expense source and move it to any preferred category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

After [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | setting budgets and recording transactions]], the "transaction section" allows users to add all transactions related to every expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This data then reflects in the "expense section," displaying the total budgeted amount, incurred expenses, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

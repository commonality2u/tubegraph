A training dashboard in [[Notion]] serves as a comprehensive tool for tracking employee training, expenses, and overall attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It typically presents two main views: the training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The dashboard offers an at-a-glance summary of all training activities and employee engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Training Overview

This section provides a summary of all scheduled trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each individual training, you can view:
*   The training date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   The employee count, indicating how many employees are supposed to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The percentage of attendance, showing how many employees have attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The training expense incurred for that specific training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

All this information is editable and customizable through various parameters found at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Employee Records Section

This view lists employees organized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Editing Departments**: You can click on a department name to edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Adding New Departments**: A new department can be added by dragging a slider to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Employee Training Status**: For each employee, the dashboard reflects the total number of trainings they've attended out of their assigned trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It also displays their attendance percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Next Training Date**: You can specify the next training date for an employee, and the dashboard will show the number of days remaining until that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Moving Employees**: Employees can be quickly shifted between departments by clicking the three-dot menu next to their name and moving them to a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Expenses Overview

Located on the left side of the dashboard, this section provides a financial summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:
*   **Total Expense**: The cumulative expense incurred for all trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Number of Trainings**: A count of all completed trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Total Employees**: The number of employees listed in the records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Average Expense**: The average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

This overview automatically updates as transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Detailed Views

Scrolling down reveals three detailed views for managing records: Training Records, Employee Details, and Training Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Employee Details

This section is where you manage individual employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Adding Employees**: Click "Add Employee" to create a new entry, which initially appears under a "No Department" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. You can then move it to any department using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Editing Employee Details**: Click the "Edit" button to type and update an employee's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Attendance Tracking**: Use a checkbox to indicate if an employee has attended a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

*   **Adding Training Records**: Always use the "Add Training" quick action button for adding new training records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Training Expenses

Once training records are added, this section displays all trainings and their associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Editing Expenses**: Click the pencil icon to edit any expense information, which will automatically update the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Changing View**: This view can be changed to a table view for quicker data entry or review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Customization

The dashboard is highly customizable to suit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Currency Settings**: Currencies can be changed in the dashboard by editing the property of the number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For dashboard currency displays, the dollar sign is part of the formula and can be altered directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

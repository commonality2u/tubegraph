The [[paycheck_budget_tracker_overview | paycheck budget tracker]] includes [[quick_action_buttons_for_managing_investments | quick action buttons]] to streamline financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. These buttons help users efficiently add transactions and expense sources directly into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Add Transaction Button

Clicking the "Add transaction" button automatically generates a new transaction entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. Users can then fill in the specific details for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Add Expense Source Button

The "Add expense source" button allows users to quickly add a new expense under one of the predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.

Initially, clicking this button adds an expense source under "fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. However, users have the flexibility to reorganize these entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. By clicking the three dots next to an added expense source, it can be moved and placed under any desired expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

These [[quick_action_buttons_for_managing_investments | quick action buttons]] are designed to help users keep their budgeted payments in check and stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

This Notion template provides a simple system for tracking hotel bookings and managing guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is designed to be easily customizable to suit specific hotel needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, two types of KPI information are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Room Booking Overview**
    This section shows the total number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**
    An indicator shows how many guests require a free pickup service ("Yes" or "No") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The count of guests requesting and not requesting free pickup is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

These KPIs are designed for specific purposes and can be [[customizing_notion_templates | customized]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Data Entry Table

The main data entry is done in a simple table at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Guest Information
Columns are available for entering the guest's name, email ID, and contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A "Special Request" field allows for additional notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Arrival and Departure Dates
The table includes fields for the guest's arrival and departure dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Users can choose to include time alongside the date for both arrival and departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Room Type Management
Users can select a room type from a pre-defined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The template also allows for the creation of new room types directly within the field by typing them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Once a new category is added, it automatically appears in the KPI section at the top, demonstrating a two-way sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Icons for room types can also be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Guest Count
A dedicated column allows users to input the number of guests for each reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While this is not currently displayed in the top KPI, it can be integrated with further [[customizing_the_notion_template_for_specific_needs | customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Free Pickup Preference
Guests' free pickup preferences can be indicated with a "Yes" or "No" option, which automatically updates the corresponding KPI summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Template Customization

This Notion template is fully [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable]] to meet individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>. By simply adding details at the bottom of the table, the information automatically reflects in the KPI section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:42">[03:00:42]</a>. For advanced [[customizing_the_notion_template_for_specific_needs | customization]] requirements, users can reach out to the creator via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:56">[02:51:56]</a>.

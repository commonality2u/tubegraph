This article outlines how to use a [[setting_up_a_travel_expense_tracker_using_notion | travel expense tracker]] within Notion to manage and plan for travel expenses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The system is designed to help users keep track of all incurred expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## System Overview

The tracker is divided into key sections: a summary section, an accounts view for setting up expense sources, an expenses view for tracking individual category spending, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Accounts

First, set up different expense categories under the "accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically classified into broad categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Any expense incurred will be booked under one of these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources

To add a new specific expense source (e.g., "Metro") under an existing category:
1.  Click "add expense source" to automatically add it to the "Travel" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon to edit the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  Set the budgeted amount for this expense source, for example, $1,500 for "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Managing Expense Categories

*   **Moving Expense Sources**: To move an expense source to a different category (e.g., from Travel to Meals), click the three dots next to it and place it under the desired section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: Click the plus sign on the right to create an entirely new group, separate from the default "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: To edit an existing category group, click on it and modify the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:34]</a>.

Each expense source has a budgeted amount set, contributing to the overall financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Expenses Summary View

This section provides a detailed view of incurred expenses against their budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   It displays the total expenses incurred for each category.
*   The budgeted expense set for that category.
*   The percentage of what has been spent relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:03]</a>.

For instance, if flight expenses are $2,000 with a $1,000 budget, it shows 200% spent and is indicated in red, signifying an over-budget expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:17]</a>. Conversely, if breakfast expenses are $100 against a $300 budget, it shows 33% spent and is indicated in green, meaning it's within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:34]</a>. This view helps users quickly assess where their expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Overall Summary Section

The summary section offers a complete overview of all travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Total Budgeted Expense**: The sum of all set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Total Expense Incurred**: The total amount spent across all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The variance between total incurred and budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Percentage Spent**: Calculated as total expenses divided by total budgeted expenses, showing the overall progress towards the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:57]</a>. For example, $3,600 incurred against a $6,100 budget reflects 59% of the budgeted expense has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

To book a new travel-related expense:
1.  **Navigate to Category**: Choose the relevant category (Travel, Meals, or Lodging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:19]</a>.
2.  **Add Expense**: Click the quick addition button, e.g., "add travel expense," which automatically adds a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  **Fill in Details**:
    *   **Description**: Add a brief description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info**: Specify details about the trip (e.g., "trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Select the specific expense source from the dropdown (e.g., "Train" for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the expense, for example, $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:17]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it immediately updates the "Expenses" summary. If a budgeted expense for that source (e.g., "Train") hasn't been set, it will initially show no percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:28]</a>. Setting a budget (e.g., $200 for Train) will then reflect the percentage spent (e.g., 50%) and appear in green if within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:41]</a>.

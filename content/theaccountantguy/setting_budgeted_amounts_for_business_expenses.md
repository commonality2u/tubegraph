A business budget template can be utilized to keep [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | budgeting for a business]] on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This template typically includes sections for accounts, expenses, and a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The business expenses summary provides an overview of financial performance relative to budgets.

### Account Section

The "Account section" allows users to set up different heads of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These can be categorized under areas like operational, administration, or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

To manage categories:
*   **Adding a new category**: Scroll right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Editing an existing category**: Click on any category to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Specifying budgeted amounts**: Once categories and accounts are set up, a [[setting_and_adjusting_budgets_for_specific_expenses_in_notion | budgeted amount]] is specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. New accounts can be added under categories, and their budgeted amounts can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The "Expenses section" displays actual expenses in [[comparison_of_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses | comparison to the budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This section updates automatically as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Visual indicators for expense tracking:
*   Expenses [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | exceeding the budgeted amount]] are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Expenses [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | within the budgeted amount]] are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Summary Section

The "Summary section" provides an overall view of the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects the [[budget_and_actual_expenses_comparison | total budgeted expense]], the total expenses incurred, the difference between the two, and the percentage of the budgeted expense set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" at the bottom of the template allows users to book expenses under their respective heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Expenses are typically categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Adding and managing transactions:
*   **Quick Add Buttons**: Buttons on the left can be used to quickly add an expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Detail Entry**: Users can input a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, associate it with relevant accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, and enter the desired amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Date Adjustment**: Expense dates can be easily changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **General Add Expense**: A "quick button" at the top allows for adding an expense source or clicking a "new" icon to add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

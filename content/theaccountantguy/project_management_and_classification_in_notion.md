The Freelancers OS in Notion provides a dashboard for freelancers to manage their entire business, including finances, client management, and specifically, project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This system allows users to track all aspects of a project from initiation to completion, integrated with client and invoicing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Navigating the System

The Notion Freelancers OS features two main navigation windows: the Finance section and the Client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Project management is primarily handled within the Client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Project Management in the Client Section

The Client section of the dashboard includes several key areas for managing business operations, including invoicing, client details, project details, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Within this section, projects are managed to keep track of work performed for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Understanding Projects

Projects represent the specific tasks or bodies of work undertaken to fulfill a work order or contract for a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. A single client contract can be divided into multiple projects, or a single project can constitute an entire contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Project Classification and Priorities

Projects are categorized by priority to help freelancers organize their workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. These classifications include:
*   Low Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   Medium Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>
*   High Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>

Users can easily change a project's priority by dragging it to a different category or by editing its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Projects

To add a new project:
1.  Click the "New" button within the desired priority category (e.g., High Priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
2.  Specify the project's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
3.  Assign a project value, which represents the monetary worth of that specific project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
4.  Set a completion date. This can be a single date or a date range (start and end date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
5.  Update the project's status (e.g., "Not Started") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Status options can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Project Details and Completion

Clicking on a project opens a detailed view where more information can be found and updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Key details include:
*   **Status:** Reflects the current state of the project (e.g., "In Progress") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Priority:** As mentioned, can be low, medium, or high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Completion Date:** The expected or actual date of completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Project Completion Percentage:** This is a calculated field, indicating how much of the project is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

#### Calculating Project Completion

The project completion percentage can be calculated in two ways:
1.  **Hourly Basis:** If an estimated number of hours for a project is specified, users can input actual hours worked. The completion percentage is then calculated based on actual hours versus estimated hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. For example, 7 hours worked out of an estimated 10 hours means 70% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
2.  **Invoicing Basis:** If the hourly tracking is not used, the system calculates completion based on the value of invoices assigned to the project compared to the total project value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For instance, if a project has a total value of $6,000 and invoices totaling $3,000 have been booked against it, the project is considered 50% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Interconnections with Other Sections

Projects are deeply integrated within the Notion Freelancers OS, linking to:
*   **Clients:** Each project is associated with a specific client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Viewing a client's profile will display all associated projects and their invoice values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This directly supports [[using_notion_for_relationship_management]].
*   **Services:** Projects are composed of one or multiple services offered to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. When viewing a project's details, linked services and their respective invoice values are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   **Invoices (Workflow):** All income transactions classified under "client" are reflected in the workflow section of the Client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. These income entries can be assigned to specific invoices, clients, projects, and services directly from the workflow area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This seamless connection streamlines [[invoicing_and_workflow_management_in_notion]] and contributes to [[organizing_financial_data_in_notion]].

### Customization

The system is highly flexible, allowing users to [[creating_and_managing_categories_in_notion]] for statuses, priorities, and other properties within the project section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This adaptability supports effective [[managing_tasks_and_objectives_in_notion]] according to individual preferences and business needs.

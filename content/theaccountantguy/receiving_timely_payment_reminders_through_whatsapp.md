This article outlines how to set up and receive automated bill payment reminders directly on your WhatsApp, as demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The system ensures you get timely notifications for recurring bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder, follow these steps:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu and select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Write the name of your bill, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill amount (e.g., $1500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Setting Recurring Payments and Notifications

Once the bill template is created, you can [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | set the bill to repeat on the recurring basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
1.  Click the drop-down again and select the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Choose how often the bill repeats (e.g., "every month") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Specify the exact time and day you wish to receive the notification (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> [!example]
>
> *   A Wi-Fi bill reminder was set for September 20th with a due amount of $3000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
> *   A Mobile bill reminder was set for $1500, scheduled to repeat monthly on the 20th at 11:55 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Automation and Notification Delivery

The system relies on an automation platform, such as Pabbly Connect, to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. An explanation and guide for setting up this automation are typically included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once this automation is established and a template is [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | set on recurring basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, you will automatically start receiving notifications on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Notifications are sent very quickly, typically under a minute from the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

This setup ensures you receive a [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | Bill's payment reminder on your WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> for every added bill every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

A template can be utilized to [[personal_finance_tracking | track emergency funds]] by providing a summary section at the top, which includes fund setup, a savings overview, and a summary of all savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The fund setup allows for the organization and definition of different savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
Funds can be categorized into predefined groups such as:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

These categories are customizable; users can edit existing ones or add new groups as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Funds
To add a new fund, users click an "add fund" button, which automatically creates a new fund under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. From there, it can be moved to the appropriate category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Each fund allows for detailed information to be entered:
*   **Fund Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   **Starting Balance:** The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount:** The targeted savings amount for that emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This is how to [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals | set savings targets and goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date:** When contributions to the specific emergency fund begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date:** The desired date by which the total emergency fund should be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This represents [[setting_and_updating_a_net_worth_goal | setting and updating a net worth goal]] for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Once these details are set, the system automatically calculates the savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Fund names can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Tracking Contributions

The contribution section is where money is added to each emergency savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Contributions are divided by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

For each contribution, the following details are tracked:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Period:** Users can select or add specific months/years for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Fund:** Users select the specific fund for which the contribution is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The amount of savings or contribution made for the month towards a specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

A "Requirement" column specifies how much contribution is needed each month to meet the targeted goal by the set end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A tick mark or check mark indicates if the monthly contribution requirement has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

A "quick action button" can be used to automatically add a new line item for the current month and date, simplifying [[tracking_savings_transactions_and_overview | tracking savings transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Quarterly and Savings Overviews

The template provides two key overview sections for [[analyzing_savings_with_quarterly_and_summary_reviews | analyzing savings with quarterly and summary reviews]].

### Quarterly Overview
This section displays all months of each quarter in a single view, showing total savings and required amounts for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It indicates the "requirement savings percentage," allowing users to quickly see how much of the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Different colors are used to provide a quick snapshot of financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. It also displays the total savings made for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Savings Overview
Divided by fund classifications, this overview provides line items for each emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It reflects:
*   **Total Savings:** The sum of the starting balance and all contributions made to date for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings:** The goal amount set for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved:** How much of the total savings requirement has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date:** The end date set for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left:** The time remaining until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This value updates daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month:** The amount needed to be contributed monthly to meet the targeted fund goal by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides a comprehensive overview of all emergency funds:
*   **Total Savings:** The combined sum of the opening balances of all funds and all contributions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required:** The total of all targeted savings amounts across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference:** The total savings less the total savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** The percentage of total savings made relative to the targeted savings amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

This complete summary provides a clear picture of overall savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

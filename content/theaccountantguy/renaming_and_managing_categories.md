The Notion expenses tracker allows users to [[setting_and_managing_expense_categories_in_notion | manage]] and customize expense [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] to suit individual requirements, whether for personal or business use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Managing Categories

The tracker features a dedicated category section at the top, which initially includes three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Each category can be tailored to the user's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

#### Renaming Categories

To rename a category:
1.  Hover over the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  Click on the pencil icon that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
3.  Rename the category as desired (e.g., to "my category") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
4.  Press Enter to save the new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

#### Editing and Deleting Categories

To edit or delete existing categories:
1.  Click on the three dots associated with the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Select "delete" to remove the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

#### Adding New Categories

To add a new category:
1.  Click on the "new page" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  A new category will be added to the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Category Functionality

Each category tracks a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As expenses are entered into the tracker, all associated [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | categories]] automatically update with the respective actual expense figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

#### Setting Budgeted Expenses

Users can define their own budgeted expense amount for each category:
1.  Click on the "budget expense amount" field within a category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Enter the desired budgeted figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
3.  The total budget in the summary section will reflect these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The summary section provides a comparison between the total budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses incurred, along with the difference and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

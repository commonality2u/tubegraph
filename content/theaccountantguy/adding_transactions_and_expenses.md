The Paycheck Budget Tracker is a tool designed to help users effectively [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track paycheck payments]] and manage budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It provides a comprehensive view of financial activity, allowing users to stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker Interface
The tracker is divided into two primary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Summary Section (Left Side)**: Displays key financial figures including total budgeted expenses, total incurred expenses, the difference between the two, and the percentage of budgeted expense spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Account Section (Right Side)**: This is where users can categorize and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Categorizing and Budgeting Expenses
Within the Account section, users can add their own expenses under three default categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to change these category names by clicking on them, setting a custom category, and confirming their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, users can set a specific budgeted amount for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Adding and Tracking Transactions
Once expense categories are set up with budgeted amounts, users can navigate to the [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **[[entering_and_summarizing_transactions | Entering Transactions]]**: Here, all transactions related to every expense can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Reflection in Expense Section**: The entered transactions will then reflect in the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, the expenses incurred, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This feature helps users [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | track income and expenses effectively]] and [[managing_business_activities_and_transactions | manage financial activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons for Efficiency
The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline the process of [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | adding and editing transactions]] and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction**: Clicking this button automatically adds a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to quickly input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source**: This button adds a new expense source, initially placing it under "fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Users can then easily move this new expense source to any desired category using the three dots menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This system ensures users can efficiently manage their budgeted payments and maintain financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

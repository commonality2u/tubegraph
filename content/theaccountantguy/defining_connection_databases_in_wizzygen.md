To begin using Wizzygen for [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | AI content generation]] within your [[Setting up a database in Notion | Notion]] workspace, one of the initial and crucial steps involves defining the connection database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This database serves as the central repository for all connections established between Wizzygen and your [[Setting up Wizzygen for Notion workspace | Notion]] workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Steps to Define the Connection Database

1.  **Access Settings**: Navigate to the settings tab by clicking the gear icon on the home screen or "settings" on the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Database Setup**: Within the settings tab, locate the "connection database" option and click on the associated icon on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  **Duplicate Template**: A new template will open, which you need to duplicate to your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Click the "duplicate" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  **Select Workspace**: A pop-up will appear, prompting you to select the specific Notion workspace where you want to duplicate this template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. After selecting, click "add to private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The connections database will then be automatically duplicated to your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
5.  **Copy and Paste URL**: Once the duplication is complete, copy the URL of the newly duplicated connections database from your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Paste this URL into the connections database field within Wizzygen's settings tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Connecting the Database to Wizzygen Integration

After the connections database is set up and its URL is stored in Wizzygen, you must connect this specific database to the Wizzygen internal integration you created earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This step ensures seamless communication.

1.  **Access Connection Options**: Go back to the duplicated connections database in Notion. Click on the three dots in the top right corner of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
2.  **Select Integration**: Scroll down the menu that appears and select the "Connections" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Then, type "Wizzygen" (or the name you assigned to your internal integration) and select the corresponding internal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
3.  **Confirm Connection**: Click "confirm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Your Notion template (the connections database) is now connected to Wizzygen via the internal integration secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This connection needs to be done only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Managing Connections

The connections database displays all the connections you've established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. You can sort and filter connections from here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Selecting a connection in the connections tab will jump you back to the "create" view, allowing you to resume work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Connections can also be deleted directly from the connections tab by clicking the three dots next to an entry and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

**Note:** All settings entered in Wizzygen, including the connection database URL, are saved in local storage. This means the data is used when accessing the web app and is not stored externally on a cloud, ensuring privacy and security. You can clear these settings from local storage at any time using the "clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

This article demonstrates how to [[setting_up_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp]], featuring the integration of "Pay Now" links within these notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system allows users to set up automated alerts for various payments, such as subscriptions, and pay directly through the received message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Setting Up WhatsApp Reminders

The process involves [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | setting up reminders]] through a database, often a Notion database, to ensure messages are received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[01:17:18]</a>.

### Creating a Template
To begin, a new template is created within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For instance, to set up a Spotify subscription reminder alert:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Select the option to [[creating_a_template_for_whatsapp_notification | create a new template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
3.  Name the subscription (e.g., Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
4.  Specify the subscription amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Setting Repetition and Schedule
Once the template is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Select "Repeat" and choose the desired repetition mode, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This will repeat the subscription reminder for the set amount each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
3.  A new window will appear to specify the exact time and start date for the reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, a reminder can be set for 11:56 AM on the 23rd of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
4.  After saving, a repetition arrow will indicate that the reminder will automatically repeat monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Receiving Automated Notifications on WhatsApp

When the set time arrives, the system automatically adds a new line item in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, the user will [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | automatically receive the notification alert on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[02:00:01]</a>.

### Pay Now Link Integration
The WhatsApp notification includes a "Pay Now" link directly within the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This link enables direct payment of the subscription amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Customization and Benefits

The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is [[customizing_reminder_messages_and_payment_details | completely customizable]] to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Users can [[notion_template_for_invoice_payment_reminders | download this template]] with instructions to set up this automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This helps users pay their subscription amounts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

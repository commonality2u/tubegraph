PDFoutput.com offers a streamlined way to [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_documents | export and manage generated PDF documents]] directly into your Google Drive, helping you keep your files organized. The tool facilitates [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk | bulk PDF document generation]] by using a [[using_google_docs_as_a_template_for_pdf_generation | Google Document as a template]] and a Notion database for data input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Selecting Google Drive as the Output Location

After setting up your template and data source, you can specify Google Drive as the destination for your generated PDF files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

1.  From the output options, select "Google Drive" as the preferred location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  Alternatively, you can choose the "downloads folder" option to save files directly to your desktop's download folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Creating a Dedicated Folder

To maintain organization, it is recommended to create a specific folder within your Google Drive for your generated PDF documents.

1.  Navigate to your Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  Create a new folder, for example, named "invitation docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
3.  Once the folder is created in Google Drive, return to PDFoutput.com and click "add folder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
4.  Select the newly created folder from the list that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This action defines your Google Drive folder as the output destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Viewing Generated PDFs

Once all settings are confirmed, click "export PDF" to begin the [[exporting_and_downloading_generated_pdf_documents | generation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The generated documents will be saved directly to your specified Google Drive folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

After the generation is complete and the count of generated PDFs is displayed, you can click "view in Google Drive" to open the folder containing your new documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The names in the generated PDFs will correspond to the data fetched from your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A debt payment tracker allows users to effectively [[managing_debt_payments_and_statuses | manage and update debt installment details]] to facilitate debt payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section provides a categorized view of debts, allowing for the specification of:
*   Debt details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Initial repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Projected "debt free by" date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Customizing Repayment Schedules
Users can add new payment categories, such as "weekly," by clicking an "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Pre-defined [[repayment_schedules_and_customization | repayment schedules]] like annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be moved between these schedules, automatically updating the repayment terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

This section offers a summary of [[tracking_progress_of_debt_payoff | debt payoff progress]]:

*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: Shows the proportion of total debt paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Interest Amount Paid**: Tracks the total interest paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

    *   Every debt repayment is bifurcated into its interest and principal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Adding and Editing Debt Details

*   **Adding New Debts**: A "added details" button quickly adds a new debt entry, initially placed under a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once added, it can be assigned to a specific payment frequency, and its details can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debts**: Users can edit existing loan details by clicking on the debt field and typing in changes. These updates automatically reflect across all relevant sections and calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Transaction Section for Payment Tracking

The "Transaction" section is central to [[debt_payment_tracking_and_analysis | tracking debt payments]] and provides detailed installment management:
*   **Paid Installment Section**: Displays all paid debts, organized by month, with the latest month at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A sum of EMIs paid for each month is also shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Payment Status**: A toggle column indicates if an amount has been paid. Clicking it updates the status (paid/unpaid) and reflects changes in the respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Entering Payment Details**: Users can input the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, select the specific loan from a dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, and enter the EMI amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Automatic Next Repayment Calculation**: The system automatically calculates the next repayment schedule based on the previously set payment frequency. For instance, a monthly student loan paid on September 30 will show an October 30 next payment, while an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will show September 27, 2024, as the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Adding New Payments**: Clicking the "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry with the current date, ready for details to be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Any changes to the EMI amount in the transaction section instantly update the overall `[[tracking_progress_of_debt_payoff | debt payoff progress]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

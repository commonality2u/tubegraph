The business budget template organizes expenses primarily by date, allowing users to track and manage expenditures effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Expense Organization by Month
In the transaction section, all [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] are itemized and batched by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Newer months will appear at the top of the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Adding Expenses with Dates
To quickly [[adding_and_managing_expenses | add an expense]], dedicated buttons on the left side of the template can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Clicking an expense button will automatically add a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. After creation, users can add the description, associate the expense to relevant accounts, and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Modifying Expense Dates
If an expense has been added with an incorrect date, or if the date needs to be changed for any reason, it can be easily updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. By clicking on the date field of an existing expense, users can select a new date as required, and the system will automatically [[dynamic_updates_of_expense_values_in_notion | update]] the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This feature helps ensure accurate [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking of income and expenses]] and aligns with [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | budget management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

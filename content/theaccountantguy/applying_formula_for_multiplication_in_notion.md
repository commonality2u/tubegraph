To [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a Notion database, two distinct [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Database Setup
A database designed for this purpose typically includes properties for the two numbers to be multiplied, and formula properties to display their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

The essential properties for the database are:
*   **Name of the Operator**: A title property, which for multiplication, would be "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Number 1**: A number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Number 2**: Another number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Multiplication Formulas

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula
This method involves using the explicit `multiply` operator within a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The two number properties are provided as inputs to this operator to compute their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol
Alternatively, you can multiply two numbers by simply placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between them in a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This offers a more concise way to achieve the same result.

## Example
If "Number 1" is `2` and "Number 2" is `3`, applying either the [[using_multiply_operator_in_notion | multiply operator formula]] or the multiply symbol will yield `6` as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Both [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas in Notion]] provide effective ways to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

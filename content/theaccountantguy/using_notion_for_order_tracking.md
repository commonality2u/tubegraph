A [[purchase_order_tracker_template_in_notion | product order tracker]] in Notion is a straightforward template designed to help businesses keep a record of all products customers are ordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Key Features

### Product and Customer Details
The tracker includes a database structured to capture essential order information:
*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Order Specifics**
    *   Payment sources: specifying how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Gift item status: indicating whether the product is being sent as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
    *   Total amount for the particular order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Order Summary
At the top of the template, an order summary section provides an overview of all placed orders:
*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Number of orders that have been placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   Number of customers who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Percentage of customers looking to place products as gift items (e.g., 67%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This percentage dynamically updates with changes to the gift item status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Payment Sources Overview
The tracker also provides insights into payment methods:
*   Breakdown of how many customers are paying through specific sources like debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Each payment source reflects the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

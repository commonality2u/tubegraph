This article details the features and functionality of a subscription expenses tracker, designed to help users [[Tracking savings and subscriptions in Notion | track]] all their subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The demonstration is provided by Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Subscription Overview Section

The tracker features a "Subscription Overview" section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

This section categorizes subscriptions into two views:
*   Active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Cancelled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Underneath each category, users can find the following information for each subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

The billing period can be changed by selecting from available options, though editing the name of the billing period is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The "Expenses" section is further divided into different categories for subscriptions, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This provides an [[Overview and categorization of subscriptions | overview and categorization of subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Users can:
*   Add a new group by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Edit an existing group by clicking on it and changing its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Within each classification, the following details are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

A "quick action" button allows users to "Add subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Newly added subscriptions initially appear under a "no subscription" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. These can be moved to any classification (e.g., active mode) and edited using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction" section is where users input all details to book subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is key for [[Tracking transactions and expenses | tracking transactions and expenses]] within the tracker.

This section includes views for:
*   Active Subscriptions, showing currently active subscriptions and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Cancelled Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

For each transaction, users can input:
*   **Status**: A checkbox indicates if the subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Subscription Account**: Pulled from the subscriptions added in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Billing Period**: Automatically pulled from the value set in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Payment Date**: Users can choose any date for the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Renewal Date**: Automatically calculated based on the payment date and billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

**Example**: A Netflix subscription paid on September 30th with a monthly billing period will show a renewal date of October 30th, calculated as 30 days or one month from the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The tracker also accommodates annual and weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

To cancel a subscription, simply click its checkbox, which automatically moves it to the cancelled status and reflects this change in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A quick "Add subscription" button is also available in this section to rapidly create new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Customization and Support

The tracker includes explanations underneath for common tasks, such as changing the currency displayed in the dashboard to suit personal preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

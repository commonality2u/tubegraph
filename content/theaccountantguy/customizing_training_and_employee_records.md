The employee training expenses tracker provides a dashboard with two main views: the Training Overview and the Employee Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows for extensive customization of both training and employee data.

## Training Overview and Records

The **Training Overview** dashboard provides a summary of all planned trainings, including the training date, the count of employees expected to attend, the percentage of attendance, and the training expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. All this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Managing Training Records

Further details and customization options for training records are available by scrolling down to the "Training Records" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
*   **Setting Training Dates**: You can specify the date for each training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Adding Training Details**: Details about the training can be fed into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Assigning Employees**: Employees can be selected and assigned to specific trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. You can also edit employee records directly from this section by accessing the employee database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Editing Training Names**: The training name itself is editable by accessing the training database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Tracking Attendance**: A checkbox allows you to indicate whether assigned employees have attended a training. This automatically updates the attendance percentage in the training records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Adding New Training Records**: A quick action button "Add training" is available to easily add new training records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Employee Records

The [[employee_record_management | Employee Record Management]] section of the dashboard displays employees categorized by their departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Managing Employee Details and Departments

Several customization options are available for [[managing_employee_details_and_departments | managing employee details and departments]]:
*   **Editing Departments**: To change a department name, click on the department and begin editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Adding New Departments**: A new department can be added by sliding the bar to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Moving Employees Between Departments**: Employees can be dragged and dropped into different departments directly from the dashboard view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Alternatively, click the three-dot menu next to an employee's name to move them to a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Tracking Training Attendance (Employee View)**: For each employee, the system displays the total number of trainings they have attended out of the total assigned, providing a quick overview of their attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Setting Next Training Dates**: You can click and specify the next training date for an employee, and the system will show the remaining days until that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Detailed Employee Management

Below the dashboard, in the "Employee Details" section, further customization for employees is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:
*   **Adding New Employees**: An "Add employee" button automatically adds a new employee under a "No Department" view, from which they can be moved to any department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Editing Employee Details**: Click the "Edit" button to type and update an employee's name and other details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It is recommended to use the quick action button on the left to add employees rather than directly editing the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Training Expenses Management

The "Training Expenses" section provides an [[overview_of_employee_training_expenses_tracker | overview of employee training expenses tracker]] and allows for [[managing_and_editing_training_expenses | managing and editing training expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

*   **Changing View**: The view can be switched to a table format for quicker editing of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Currency Customization

The currency displayed in the tracker is fully customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Expense View**: In the expense table view, you can click on the currency property, select "edit property," and change the number format to any currency of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Dashboard View**: For currency in the dashboard, you can click on any expense information and edit the dollar sign directly within the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

This [[customizing_expense_tracking_for_personal_needs | customizing expense tracking for personal needs]] and employee management system is designed to be entirely flexible to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

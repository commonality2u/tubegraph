The Notion small business bookkeeping template is designed to help users track all bookkeeping needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Before inputting transactions, it's crucial to set up the accounts correctly.

The template is divided into three main sections:
1.  **Start Here Section**: For initial setup and account configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  **Transactions Window**: Where all business transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Starting with Accounts

To begin, navigate to the "Start Here" section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This section contains the "Account" area, which is essential for establishing the foundational structure of your bookkeeping system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Account Categories

The template pre-defines several primary account categories or "heads" under which specific accounts are organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
*   **Expenses**: E.g., Purchase expense, Utility bills, Subscription, Salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: E.g., Accounts payable, Taxes payable, Accrued expenses, Credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Managing Accounts

Users can [[customizing_financial_accounts_and_transactions | customize financial accounts]] within these categories:

*   **Editing Existing Items**: Hover over an item, click the pencil icon, make changes, and click outside the box to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Deleting Items**: Click the three-dot icon next to an item and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Adding New Items**: Scroll to the respective category and click "New page" to add a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Account Details and Properties

For every account item, several key properties can be defined, contributing to comprehensive [[setting_up_accounts_and_classifications_in_a_cash_flow_template | account classification]] and tracking:

*   **Opening Balance**: Enter any carried-forward balances for liabilities or assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Classify the item as "bills," "debt," "savings," or other relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This classification is later used within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: For recurring payments, specify the frequency (e.g., monthly, half-yearly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Relevant for inventory or assets, this indicates the starting number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: If the account represents an asset, classify it as "inventory" or "investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Integration with Transactions

Once accounts are set up in the "Start Here" section, they are automatically reflected and available for selection in the "Transactions" window below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

When [[adding_and_managing_income_and_expenses | adding income and expenses]] or other transactions:
*   Clicking "Add Income" or "Add Expense" creates a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   The "Category" field is pre-mapped based on the button clicked (e.g., income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   The "Account" field allows selecting from the accounts previously defined in the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Adding a new account directly in the transactions window will also add it to the top accounts section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Further details such as payment mode (bank account, cash), transaction type (inflow/outflow), amount, document attachment, tax rate, tax amount, and currency multiplier can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

[[managing_investments_inventory_and_transactions_in_a_business_cash_flow_template | Investment and inventory transactions]] are also tracked with details like units, price, and total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Summary Updates

All transactions entered in the "Transactions" window automatically update the "Summary" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This allows for an at-a-glance view of the business's financial status, including assets, income, liabilities, expenses, debt, budgeting, savings, bills, subscriptions, taxes, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The process of [[using_notion_templates_for_financial_management | using Notion templates for financial management]] effectively begins with setting up the accounts and their details in the "Start Here" section, which then populates the rest of the template for easy transaction entry and financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

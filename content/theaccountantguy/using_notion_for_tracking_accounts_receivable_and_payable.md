The Notion Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker is designed to help users track all customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive system for managing outstanding invoices and payments, offering various views and summary sections to provide a clear financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Accounts Receivable and Payable Account Section

This section, located at the top of the tracker, includes four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Accounts View

The Accounts View allows users to set up customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This includes recording their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Adding new customers or vendors can be done using quick action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Once added, a pencil icon allows for editing all details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, including the starting balance of the receivable or payable and pending invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Receivable Section

This section reflects all receivable accounts and their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It displays all transactions carried out, including invoice dates and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Invoice Status**: Users can change the status of each invoice, with options like "Paid," "Outstanding," or "Partial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking**: A checkbox allows users to mark an invoice as paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When checked, the paid amount is not included in the outstanding balance calculation at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This provides a clear reflection of the outstanding amount for each customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Payable Section

Similar to the Receivable Section, the Payable Section shows details of each transaction, including the date an invoice was made, invoice number, status, and the amount raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Users can also mark invoices as paid or unpaid, which automatically adjusts the outstanding balances shown at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Summary Section

This section provides an overall summary of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance, all calculated from the transactions entered in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The Transaction Section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Receivable Segment

In the Receivable segment, users can input details such as the date, the period (divided into four quarters), description, account name, amount, invoice number, and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Once these details are entered, they automatically update across the entire tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

A "Paid" checkbox in the first column indicates whether the amount has been settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. If checked, the amount will not be included in the total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Quick action buttons on the left allow for adding new receivable entries, which automatically pick up the current date and provide relevant fields for input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Transactions are bated into months, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Payable Segment

Similar functionalities are available in the Payable segment, allowing for the entry and tracking of payable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. A quick action button for adding payable entries is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The Notion personal finance tracker includes a dedicated section for [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | tracking debt payments]] and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This feature allows users to monitor upcoming and past debt payments, along with total debt and amounts paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts
To begin [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | tracking debt]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view and then to the "Liabilities" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Adding New Debt
To add a new debt, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
1.  **Name**: Enter the name of the debt (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
2.  **Opening Balance**: Specify any initial opening balance for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
3.  **Classification**: Select "Debt" from the available classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
4.  **Payment Frequency**: Set how frequently payments are expected (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Modifying Existing Debt
Existing debt accounts can be modified by clicking the pencil icon next to them in the "Liabilities" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Entering Debt Transactions
Once debt accounts are set up, transactions related to debt payments or new loans are recorded in the "Transactions" view under the "Liability" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Recording a Debt Payment
1.  Click "New" to add a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Select the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Transactions are automatically organized by month in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
3.  **Account**: Select the specific debt account (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
4.  **Payment Mode**: Choose how the payment was made (e.g., Bank, Cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
5.  **Transaction Type**: For debt repayments, select "Outflow" as money is leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
6.  **Amount**: Enter the amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This updates the total outstanding debt for that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Recording a New Loan
If a new loan is obtained, the transaction type should be "Inflow" as money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments in Summary
The "Debt" view under the "Summary" section provides an overview of all debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It has two main views:
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows debts due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This helps in identifying upcoming financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Displays payments that were due but have not yet been recorded for the current period, indicating potential missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

For each debt, the view shows:
*   The total loan amount (opening balance + additional loans taken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   The total repayment made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   The repayment percentage and the amount still unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Customizing the Debt View
The layout of the debt view can be changed to suit personal preferences:
1.  Click the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
2.  Select "Layout" to choose between formats like "List" or "Gallery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
3.  "Properties" allows enabling or disabling specific debt details (e.g., total amount paid, repayment percentage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
4.  Grouping can be set to "Payment Status" (Upcoming/Past) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
5.  Sorting can be set to "Manual" to prioritize upcoming payments at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Connecting to Overall Finances
The debt information automatically integrates with the overall [[finance_management_using_notion | finance management]] dashboard. Liabilities, including debts, contribute to the calculation of your [[how_to_set_financial_goals_in_notion | net worth]], which is the difference between assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. This allows for a comprehensive overview of your financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.

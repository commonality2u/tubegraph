This article describes how to utilize an Investment Portfolio Tracker to monitor investments. The tracker is designed to help users keep tabs on all their holdings and [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker Interface

The tracker features a main section for the portfolio with quick action buttons, and a separate section for investment [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Investment Section

The investment section is structured to allow classification of holdings into categories such as stocks and cryptos, with the option to add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For each investment, users must input the [[tracking_opening_and_closing_cash_balances|opening balance]] and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Adding New Investments

A "quick action button" labeled "add investment" allows for rapid entry of new holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. When clicked, a new panel appears where users can enter:
*   Investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   [[tracking_opening_and_closing_cash_balances|Opening balance]] (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Investments can be classified under existing categories like stocks or crypto, or moved to a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Users can also create new custom groups, such as "bonds," which will add a new section to the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Existing items can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Portfolio Section

The portfolio section provides a summary of investments, classified under their respective groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This section displays:
*   Investment value at the end of the financial year or after all [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Units available after all [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Investment percentage, indicating the proportion of a specific investment to the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   A profit/loss section, showing the total profit or loss for each investment after all [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This includes a per-investment profit/loss figure and a summation for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Transactions Section

The [[using_a_transactions_tab_for_finance|transactions]] section [[tracking_inventory_status_and_transactions|tracks all]] investment [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It offers different views:

### All Transactions View
This view lists all buy and sell [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For every transaction, users must provide:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Type of transaction (buy or sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   The investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Number of units (e.g., selling 30 units, buying 50 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Price (calculated automatically in buy/sell sections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Amount (units multiplied by price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Buy and Sell Views
Separate views for "buy" and "sell" [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Users can fill in the same information, and the system automatically calculates the buy or sell amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Profit and Loss View
This section specifically shows the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It includes the sales value and the buy price for each transaction to calculate the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. For example, if 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each (total $1,200) after being bought for $10 each, a profit of $900 ($30 difference per unit multiplied by 30 units) is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Quick Action Buttons for Transactions
Similar to adding investments, "buy investment" and "sell investment" quick action buttons are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Clicking these automatically adds a new line item under the respective buy or sell view, pre-populating the current date, which can then be adjusted by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

This Investment Portfolio Tracker allows for [[monitoring_investments_and_net_worth|tracking investments]] and [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals|transactions]] with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

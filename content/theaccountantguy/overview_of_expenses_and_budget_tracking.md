This article provides an overview of a business expense tracker designed to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | keep track of all business expenses]] under one general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker allows users to [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | define expense categories]] for their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Predefined categories are provided and can be modified or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Subcategories can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   New categories can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Users can set a [[monthly_budget_setup | budgeted amount of expense]] for each category, which will automatically reflect in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, changing a budgeted amount for "advertising" from $100 to $5,000 will update the expenses overview accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   It displays the total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   It shows the [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expenses]] that were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   A percentage indicates whether actual spending has exceeded or remained within the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   All values in this section automatically update based on changes made to budgeted amounts or entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Transactions

The "transaction" section is where individual expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Users can select the date of the expense, which automatically populates based on the selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   A description of the expense can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Users can select and add accounts that have been previously defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The amount of the expense is entered here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary

On the left side of the interface, a summary panel provides key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   It displays the [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   It shows the total actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and total expense is calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   It presents the percentage of the [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | budgeted expense]] that has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

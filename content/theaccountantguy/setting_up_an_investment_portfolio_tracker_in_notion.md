An Investment Portfolio Tracker in [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | Notion]] allows you to monitor and manage all your investments. This guide outlines how to utilize such a tracker to keep tabs on your stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

The Investment Portfolio Tracker is typically divided into key sections:
*   **Portfolio Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Investment Portfolio** (often nested within the portfolio section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Quick Action Button** for adding investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Transactions Section** to record all investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Investment Section

This section is where you manage your individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
It is categorized by default into "stocks" and "cryptos," but you have the flexibility to add your own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Adding Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

For each investment, you need to input:
*   **Opening Balance:** The initial value of the investment at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Opening Units:** The number of units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

You can quickly add a new investment using the "Add Investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking this button adds a new entry, which can then be edited by clicking the pencil icon to input details like name, opening balance, and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Managing Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

New investments can be moved between existing categories (e.g., stocks, crypto) by clicking a three-dot menu next to the investment name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

> [!TIP] Adding New Categories
> To create a new investment category (e.g., "bonds"), click the "plus" icon within the investment section and type the new group name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This will add a new section for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Portfolio Section

The portfolio section provides an updated view of your investments after all transactions have been processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It shows:
*   **Investment Value:** The current value of each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Units Available:** The current number of units held for each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Investment Percentage:** The proportion of a specific investment relative to your total investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Section:** Displays the total profit or loss for each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A profit/loss figure for each investment is displayed on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, with a summation of profit/loss for each category at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section tracks all buy and sell transactions related to your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It typically has four main views:

### All Transactions View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
This view lists both buy and sell transactions together. For each transaction, you need to input:
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Description:** A brief detail of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Type of Transaction:** Whether it's a buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Account of Investment:** The specific investment (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Number of Units:** The quantity of units bought or sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Price:** The price per unit (calculated automatically in buy/sell sections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The total transaction amount (units multiplied by price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Buy and Sell Views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
Separate views for "Buy" and "Sell" transactions simplify data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. When inputting the buy or sell price, the total amount is automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

> [!TIP] Quick Action Buttons for Transactions
> *   **Buy Investment:** Clicking this button automatically adds a new line item under the "Buy" view and pre-fills the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
> *   **Sell Investment:** Similarly, this button creates a new line item under the "Sell" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Profit and Loss View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
This view allows you to see the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It includes details such as the sales value and an additional "Buy price" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The profit or loss is calculated based on the difference between the sell and buy prices multiplied by the number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

This comprehensive tracker helps in efficiently managing and monitoring your investments in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

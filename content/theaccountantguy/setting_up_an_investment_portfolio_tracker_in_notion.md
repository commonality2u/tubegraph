This article demonstrates how to utilize an Investment Portfolio tracker in [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | Notion]] to manage all your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The tracker is designed to help you monitor your investment portfolio and track individual transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker Structure

The tracker consists of two main sections:
*   **Portfolio Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Transaction Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Investment Portfolio Section

This section is where you manage your investment details and track their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Investment Overview
The investments are categorized into sections like "stocks" and "cryptos," but you can add your own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For each investment, you need to input the opening balance and the opening units at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Portfolio Section
The portfolio section displays the same investments, categorized by stocks, cryptos, and any other groups you've added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This view reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It also shows the investment percentage, indicating each investment's proportion of your total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Profit/Loss Section
This area shows the total profit or loss for each investment after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A profit/loss figure for each investment is displayed on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. At the top, you'll find the sum of profit or loss for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Investments
To add a new investment:
1.  Click the "Add Investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  A new panel will open where you can add details like the investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
4.  Input the opening balance (e.g., $100) and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
5.  By default, it will be unclassified. To categorize it (e.g., under "crypto"), click the three-dot icon and move it to the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
6.  You can also create a new category by clicking the plus icon and typing in a new group name, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section details all financial transactions related to your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Transaction Views
The transaction section offers four main views:
*   **All**: Shows all buy and sell transactions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Buy**: Displays only buy transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Sell**: Displays only sell transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Profit and Loss**: Shows the profit or loss generated by each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Transaction Details
For each transaction, you need to input the following information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>:
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Type**: Whether it's a buy or sell transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Account**: The specific investment (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Number of Units**: The quantity of units bought or sold (e.g., 30 units, 50 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Price**: The price per unit at the time of the transaction (calculated automatically in buy/sell views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The total amount of the transaction, which is units multiplied by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Profit and Loss Calculation
In the "Profit and Loss" view, for each sold transaction, an additional "Buy price" field is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By inputting the original buy price, the tracker automatically calculates the profit or loss generated from that specific transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For example, if 30 units were sold for $40 each and bought for $10 each, a profit of $900 is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Adding Transactions
You can quickly add transactions using the dedicated quick action buttons:
*   **Buy Investment**: Clicking this button automatically adds a new entry under the "Buy" view and pre-fills the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment**: Similarly, clicking this button creates a new entry under the "Sell" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

You can then fill in the remaining details for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

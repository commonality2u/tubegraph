The [[notion_app | Notion]] Freelancers OS is a comprehensive dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their entire business, including finances and client relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This setup allows users to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_with_a_notion_dashboard | track all their income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Navigation

Upon downloading the setup, users land on a main page that provides quick instructions, such as how to change the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A video demonstration is available for currency changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, as well as a quick tutorial on how to use the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The dashboard features two main navigation windows: "Finance" and "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Users can switch between these sections using the navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Finance Section

The "Finance" section is where freelancers can [[tracking_income_and_expenses_with_a_notion_dashboard | track all their income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It's recommended to watch the dedicated tutorial video if unfamiliar with the finance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> All income transactions, especially those classified under "client," will reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Users can add new income and classify it as "client" or create their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Client Section

The "Client" section is a dashboard for client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It's designed to manage client invoicing, details, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Workflow Details

At the bottom of the client section, a "workflow" area displays all income categorized under "client" from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Users can filter this section by their own classifications if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This section allows users to link incomes to specific invoices, clients, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Information fed into the "workflow" automatically updates other sections of the dashboard, such as total invoice amounts for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Payments received can be marked with a "Bank" payment mode, which updates banking calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Client Details

The client details section categorizes clients into three pipelines: "Lead," "Negotiation," and "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> To add a new client, click the "New" button in the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Users can then specify the client name, contract value, and other details like company, contact, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Invoice Amount**: This automatically reflects the total invoice amount raised against a client, pulled from the invoicing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Value**: Users manually input the total contract value for a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The system automatically calculates the percentage of the contract value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Clients can be easily dragged and dropped between different pipeline categories (e.g., from "Client" to "Negotiating") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Project Details

This section helps track all projects related to client contracts, categorized by priority: "Low," "Medium," and "High" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> To add a new project, click "New" under the desired priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Users specify the project name, project value, and a completion date (which can be a single date or a range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The status of the project can also be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

*   **Project Completion Calculation**:
    *   **By Hours**: Users can specify estimated hours for a project and then book actual hours. The completion percentage is calculated based on actual hours divided by estimated hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **By Invoicing**: Alternatively, if hours are not specified, completion is calculated based on the total value of invoices assigned to the project compared to the total project value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Services Section

Services are categorized by their status: "Not Started," "In Progress," and "Completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Multiple services can be associated with a single project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> To add a service, click "New" under the relevant status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Users specify the service name, pricing (hourly or fixed fee), and the service rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Additional details include service duration, status, and the client and project it's linked to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Invoicing Section

The invoicing section tracks the status of invoices: "Draft," "Sent," and "Paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. It also displays the total invoice amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> To add a new invoice, click "New" under the desired status category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Input an invoice number and the due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The invoice amount is automatically pulled from the "workflow" section once an income is assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Invoices, clients, projects, and services can be created either by adding them directly in their respective sections or by creating them on the fly within the "workflow" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

## Tools Section

The "Tools" section provides additional functionalities to manage various aspects of a freelancing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Resources

This view helps organize useful resources categorized into "Checklists," "Guides," "Strategies," or "Tips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Contacts

The contact section allows users to maintain a catalog of contacts, categorized by their role (e.g., Finance, Services, Legal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

> Users can add new contacts, specifying details like contact name, designation, phone number, address, email ID, and company name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Categories can be customized or new ones created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Goals

This section allows users to set and track personal or business-related goals, classified under categories such as "Health," "Wealth," and "Relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> To add a goal, input the goal description, a target date, a target numerical value, and the progress achieved so far. The completion percentage is automatically calculated (e.g., 3 pounds lost out of a 10-pound target is 30% complete) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

Meeting priority (low, medium, high) can also be assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

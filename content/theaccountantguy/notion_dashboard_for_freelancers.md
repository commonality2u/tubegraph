Notion Books Freelancers OS is a specialized Notion dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their entire finances, including income and expense details, and to assist with client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Upon downloading, users land on a central page that provides quick instructions on changing currency and a tutorial for using the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The dashboard features two primary navigation windows: **Finance** and **Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Users can switch between these sections to manage different aspects of their freelance business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Finance Section

The finance section allows freelancers to track all their income and expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Income Tracking**: Any income related to a client can be added and classified as "client income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Users can also create their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Data Flow**: All income transactions, once entered and classified under "client," automatically reflect in the client portal for easy tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This ensures that only client-related income is displayed in the client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Tutorials**: A dedicated video tutorial is available within the dashboard to guide users on how to effectively use the finance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Client Section

The client section is a comprehensive portal for managing client relationships, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Key Components

Under the client section, users will find four main areas at the outset:
*   **Invoicing Details**: For managing all invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Client Details**: For tracking all client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Project Details**: For overseeing ongoing and completed projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Services Section**: For detailing the services offered to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Tool Section

Beneath the main client components, a "Tools" section provides additional functionalities:
*   **Resources**: A repository for useful resources, categorized into checklists, guides, strategies, and tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Contacts**: To manage all business contacts, including contact details, company names, and meeting schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Goals**: A section to set and track personal or business-related goals, categorized by health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Calendar**: A meeting schedule to get a quick glance of all appointments for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Workflow Details

The workflow section within the client portal specifically filters and displays all income classified as "client" from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This ensures that only client-related income is visible, excluding other types of income like salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Managing Client Details

The dashboard allows users to manage client details through a pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>:
*   **Client Pipeline**: Clients can be categorized into "Lead," "Negotiation," or "Client" stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Adding Clients**: New clients can be added directly into any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Invoice Amount**: The "Invoice Amount" for each client automatically reflects the total of all invoices raised against them, pulling information from the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Value**: Users can manually input the contract value for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The system then automatically calculates the percentage of the contract value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Client Properties**: Each client entry includes details such as company, contact, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It also links to work-related details, showing associated invoices and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Clients can be easily dragged and dropped between different pipeline categories (e.g., from 'Client' to 'Negotiating') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Managing Projects

Projects track the specific work being done to fulfill a client's work order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Priorities**: Projects are categorized by priority: low, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Adding Projects**: New projects can be added by specifying the project name, value, and expected completion date range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Status Updates**: Project status can be updated (e.g., "not started," "in progress," "completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Completion Percentage**: Project completion percentage can be calculated in two ways:
    *   **Hourly Basis**: By specifying estimated hours and then tracking actual hours spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Invoicing Basis**: By comparing the invoiced amount for the project against its total project value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Linking**: Each project displays the client it's for and the services provided under it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Managing Services

Services are the specific offerings provided under each project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Categories**: Services are categorized by their status: "not started," "in progress," or "completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Adding Services**: Users can add new services, specifying the service name, pricing model (hourly or fixed flat rate fees), and the service rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
*   **Service Details**: Each service entry can include its expected duration, status, and in future iterations, assigned team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Interlinking**: Services are linked to specific clients and projects, displaying the income, client, project, and total service value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Managing Invoices

The invoicing section helps track the status of payments from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. [[using_notion_for_invoice_generation | Using Notion for invoice generation]] is streamlined.
*   **Statuses**: Invoices are categorized by "Draft," "Sent," and "Paid" statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Invoice Amount Tracking**: The total invoice amount for each category is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Users can also view the count of unique invoices in each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Adding Invoices**: New invoices can be added by specifying an invoice number and a due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Workflow Integration**: The invoice amount for a newly added invoice is automatically pulled from the income recorded in the workflow section at the bottom of the client dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Users can specify the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") once an invoice has been paid. Removing the payment mode for unpaid invoices ensures accurate banking calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Workflow Integration

The workflow section at the bottom of the client dashboard is central to connecting all client-related data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Centralized Income View**: It displays all client-assigned income carried over from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **Linking Data**: Users can link specific income entries to an invoice, client, project, and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

*   **Flexible Data Entry**: Information can be added from the top-level sections (clients, projects, services) and then linked in the workflow, or new entries (like invoices, clients, or projects) can be created directly from the workflow section and they will automatically populate the respective top-level sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

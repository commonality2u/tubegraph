Notion databases, such as the Products Order Tracker template, are designed to be fully customizable to suit specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15">01:15</a>.

## Expanding and Adding Properties
Users can expand a database to include more items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">01:32</a>. Additionally, new properties and metrics can be added to a database, such as:
*   Average order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">01:17</a>
*   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">01:22</a>

## Example: Products Order Tracker Database
The Products Order Tracker is a Notion database that tracks product orders for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>. It includes the following types of information:
*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">00:00:12</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">00:00:15</a>
    *   Billing address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>
    *   Phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>
    *   Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">00:00:20</a>
*   **Order Details**
    *   Payment sources (e.g., debit card, PayPal, credit card, other) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>
    *   Indication of whether the product is a gift item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>
    *   Order amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>

### Order Summary and Analytics
The template also provides an order summary at the top, which displays key metrics:
*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>
*   Number of orders placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>
*   Number of customers who placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>
*   Percentage of products ordered as gift items, which dynamically updates when values are changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>
*   Breakdown of payment sources, showing the number of customers and respective percentages for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">00:01:02</a>

This database is designed to help track all product-related orders placed by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">01:27</a>.

### Integration with PDF Generation
There are plans to add a Notion database feature to PDFoutput.com, which will allow users to add details to their [[adding_properties_in_a_notion_database | Notion database]] and export documents from there in a bulk PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">04:49</a>. This would facilitate [[using_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_generation | PDF generation from Notion databases]].

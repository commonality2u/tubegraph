## How to Generate Single PDF Documents

Upon logging into PDFoutput.com, users are presented with an interface where they can select a template from a dropdown menu, such as an invoice template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Users can also select their preferred currency from several available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

To generate a single PDF:
1.  Fill in the required details related to the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. As details are entered, the PDF will populate with the corresponding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
2.  Click "Download PDF" to automatically generate the document based on the filled information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
3.  The currency can be changed at any time, and the invoice will adjust accordingly before a new PDF is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

For users who need to [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents_in_bulk | export PDF documents in bulk]], PDFoutput.com offers a "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Clicking on "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
2.  Filling in a provided database with the necessary details for multiple invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This database includes fields like invoice number, invoice date, and other details similar to the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Columns in the database can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
3.  Once the database is filled, click "Download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. The system will then generate PDF documents one by one based on the information in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
4.  Generated bulk PDFs maintain the same format as single PDF documents and reflect the chosen currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

In addition to downloading all PDFs, users can also [[exporting_and_downloading_generated_pdf_documents | export a PDF document for a particular row]] by clicking the "download PDF" option for any individual row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Features and Future Development

Currently, the platform supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Future updates are planned to include a Notion database feature, allowing users to add details to their Notion database and export documents from PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. More [[using_templates_to_generate_pdf_documents | templates]] will also be added in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, potentially including [[generating_pdf_documents_from_invoices | generating PDF documents from invoices]] or for [[generating_pdf_documents_for_purchase_orders | purchase orders]]. Users can submit requests for specific templates or provide feedback through the available feedback window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

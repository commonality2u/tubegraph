Notion Books Freelancers OS offers a comprehensive dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their entire business, including finances, client interactions, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This system allows for the tracking of income and expenses, and integrates with a client management portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Client Management and Workflow
The system is divided into two main navigation windows: Finance and Client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The client section provides a dedicated portal for [[Client management using Notion | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. All income transactions classified under "client" in the finance section will automatically reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Within the client section, freelancers can manage:
*   Invoicing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Client details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   Project details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Services offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

The client details feature allows tracking clients through different pipelines: Lead, Negotiation, and Current Client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. New clients can be added to any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, and their status can be changed by simply dragging and dropping them into a different pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Each client's profile can include their company, contact details, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The system automatically calculates the total invoice amount against a client based on linked invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> and tracks the percentage of contract value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Project Management
The Projects section allows freelancers to track all ongoing projects related to a specific work order or contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects are categorized by priority: Low, Medium, and High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Projects
To add a new project, users simply click the "New" button in the desired priority category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Details to specify include:
*   **Project Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>
*   **Project Value**: The estimated value of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Completion Date**: A specific date or a date range (start and end dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Status**: E.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," or customizable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Priority**: Can be updated by dragging the project to a different priority column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Project Completion Calculation
Project completion can be calculated in two ways:
1.  **Hourly Basis**: Users can specify estimated hours for project completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> (e.g., 10 hours) and then log actual hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> (e.g., 7 hours completed for 70% completion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
2.  **Invoicing Basis**: Completion is calculated based on the total project value and the amount of invoices raised for that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For example, if a project has a $6,000 value and $3,000 has been invoiced, it shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

Projects are linked to specific clients and can be associated with multiple services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Services Management
The Services section allows freelancers to track the services they offer, which can be linked to specific projects and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Services are categorized by status: Not Started, In Progress, and Completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Services
To add a new service, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a> and provide the following details:
*   **Service Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>
*   **Service Pricing**: Can be set on an hourly basis or as a fixed flat rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. These options are customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Service Rate**: The specific price per hour or the fixed fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

Each service's details can include its expected duration (deadline), rate, status, and associated team members (a feature planned for future updates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Services are also linked to the client and project they are provided for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

## Invoicing and Workflow Integration
The Invoicing section organizes invoices by status: Draft, Sent, and Paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. It displays the total invoice amount for each status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

New invoices can be created with an invoice number and a due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The workflow section at the bottom integrates incomes from the finance view with invoices, clients, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. When an income is linked to an invoice, client, project, and service in the workflow, the relevant information is automatically fed back into the respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Invoices can also be created directly from the workflow section, which automatically adds them to the main invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The payment mode for an income can be updated (e.g., "Bank" when paid), which impacts financial calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Supporting Tools
Beyond core project and service management, the system includes a "Tools" section, contributing to [[Utilizing tools and resources for better freelancing | utilizing tools and resources for better freelancing]]:
*   **Resources**: Curated resources such as checklists, guides, strategies, and tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. Users can add new resources with categories and links, and embed notes or to-do lists within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.
*   **Contacts**: A catalog for managing contact details for various services, finance, or legal departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. Users can add contact names, designations, phone numbers, addresses, emails, and company names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Goals**: A section to set and track personal or business goals, categorized by health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. Goals can have a target number and track progress, which automatically calculates a completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Calendar**: Displays all scheduled meetings for the month, allowing quick addition of new meetings with titles, agendas, linked clients or contacts, medium (e.g., Google Meet, Skype), attachments, and priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. The calendar view can be switched between monthly and weekly views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

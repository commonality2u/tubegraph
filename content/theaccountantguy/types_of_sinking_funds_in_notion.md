When [[building_a_notion_sinking_funds_tracker|building a Notion sinking funds tracker]], various types of [[sinking_funds|sinking funds]] can be established to manage specific financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The tracker is designed to monitor the overall savings needed, the amount saved over time, the remaining amount to save, and the percentage of contribution made during a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Categories of Sinking Funds

The Notion tracker categorizes [[sinking_funds|sinking funds]] into six distinct types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
*   Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

These categories are established within the "Sinking Funds" database, which is the foundational database for managing all [[sinking_funds|sinking fund]] details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Tracking Metrics for Each Sinking Fund

For each specific [[sinking_funds|sinking fund]] type, the Notion tracker monitors several key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Amount Saved**: The total amount saved towards the fund to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Amount Left to Save**: The remaining balance required to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Contribution Made (Percentage)**: The proportion of the goal amount that has been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Targeted Date**: The desired end date for completing the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Required Contribution Each Month**: The calculated monthly payment needed to meet the goal by the targeted date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is determined by the difference between the goal amount and the starting balance, divided by the number of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Other properties in the "Sinking Funds" database include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:

*   **Start Date**: The date when saving for the [[sinking_funds|sinking fund]] began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

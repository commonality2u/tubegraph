This guide explains how to track your net worth using a Notion template developed by Sanat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Overview of the Notion Net Worth Tracker

The [[notion_net_worth_tracker_tutorial | net worth tracker]] template in Notion is organized into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

1.  **Get Started Section**: Here you define your [[setting_net_worth_goals_in_notion | net worth goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: This is where you specify all the different accounts related to your personal finances, categorized as expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: This provides an overview of your entire finances, displaying closing balances and proportions for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It also includes a dedicated Net Worth section to show the overall calculation, including your goal, total net worth, the difference, growth, and percentage towards your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Transactions View**: This section is used to input all income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities, which in turn helps calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Accounts

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal

Initially, you will set your [[setting_net_worth_goals_in_notion | net worth goal]] in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. You can click on the existing amount (e.g., $10,000) and edit it to your desired goal (e.g., $14,000 or $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates other related calculations in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Accounts

In the "Account" section, you'll find default accounts already added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. To add a new account, scroll down within each category (e.g., income, expenses, assets, liabilities) and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When adding an account, you'll fill in several fields:

*   **Account Name**: Specify the name (e.g., "Interest Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**:
    *   For income and expenses, this is usually left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   For assets and liabilities, this is the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Assign a tag to categorize the account (e.g., "Other Income", "Savings", "Debt Payments", "Crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add your own categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: For income or liabilities, you can specify how often payments are received or made (e.g., "Monthly" for salary, "Quarterly" for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can also add custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: This field is primarily for investments (assets) to track the starting number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For income and expenses, it's left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: This field is specifically used for investments, where you classify the asset as "Investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. For other accounts, leave it blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

To edit an existing account, click on the pencil icon next to it, which will open the edit window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. All account values are entirely customizable and can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

The "Transactions" section allows you to record all financial activities. It has four specific views: "Income", "Expense", "Asset", and "Liabilities", plus an "All" view to see everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are sorted by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

To enter a new transaction, click the "New" button within any of these views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:

*   **Date**: Select the transaction date. This automatically categorizes the transaction into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Description**: Briefly describe the transaction (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Category**: The template automatically sets the category based on the view you are in (e.g., "Income" if you are in the income view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the specific account you created earlier that this transaction relates to (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Choose how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**:
    *   **Inflow**: For all income transactions (money coming into your account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This also applies when you obtain a new loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> or sell an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: For all expense transactions (money going out of your account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This applies when you put money into an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> or repay a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Document**: You can attach receipts or bills by embedding a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Understanding the Summary Section

After entering all your accounts and transactions, the "Summary" section computes your net worth.

### Finances Overview

The "Finances" view within the summary shows all your expenses, income, assets, and liabilities as of the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion relative to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Net Worth View

The "Net Worth" view presents five key statistical figures:

1.  **Net Worth Goal**: The goal you [[setting_net_worth_goals_in_notion | set earlier]] (e.g., $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. For example, if assets are $6,950 and liabilities are $1,600, the net worth is $5,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The difference between your net worth goal and your current total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For example, $12,000 (goal) - $5,350 (current) = $6,650 (difference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: This represents the closing net worth value minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of your assets and liabilities specified in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: This shows how much of your net worth goal you have accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. It's calculated as (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) * 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

As you continue to add transactions and update accounts, your net worth will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

The [[overview_of_employee_training_expenses_tracker | Employee Training Expenses Tracker]] is designed to manage and monitor training-related expenditures within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a central view for tracking training information, including expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Key information displayed for each training includes:
*   **Training Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Employees Count**: The number of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Attendance**: Indicates how many employees attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Training Expense**: The cost associated with each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

All this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Expenses Overview Section

Located on the left side of the dashboard, the expenses overview section reflects the total expenses incurred for all trainings and the total number of trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It also indicates the number of employees expected to attend trainings and provides an average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This average expense automatically updates as new transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Detailed Expense Tracking and Editing

By scrolling down the tracker, users can access three detailed views: Training Records, Employee Details, and Training Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Training Expenses Section

This section displays all recorded trainings and their associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. To edit an expense:
1.  Navigate to the Training Expenses section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  Click on the pencil icon next to the desired training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
3.  Edit the expense information; the dashboard will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. For example, an expense of $1,400 can be changed to $1,800, and the change will be immediately reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

This view can also be changed to a table view for quicker data input and review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Customizing Currency Settings

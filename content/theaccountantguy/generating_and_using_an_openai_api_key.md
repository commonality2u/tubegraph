To interact with the Notion Formula Chatbot, the first prerequisite is to [[defining_and_using_api_keys_for_ai_engines_like_gemini_and_gpt | generate and configure an OpenAI API key]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This key allows the chatbot to communicate with OpenAI's models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Generating Your OpenAI API Key

1.  **Access the OpenAI Platform**: Within the chatbot interface, click on the question mark icon to find a link that directs you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys**: Once on the OpenAI platform, locate and click on "Open API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  **Create a New Secret Key**: Click on "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  **Name and Confirm**: Fill in a name for your key (e.g., "test key") and then click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  **Copy the Key**: The system will generate a new key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It is crucial to copy this key immediately and save it securely, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Free Credit and Model Limitations
When you create a new OpenAI account, you typically receive $5 worth of free credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This credit can be used for testing the chatbot but is generally limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Using Your OpenAI API Key in the Chatbot

1.  **Paste the Key**: Copy the generated API key and paste it into the designated field within the chatbot interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
2.  **Confirmation**: After pasting the key, a message will confirm that the API key has been entered, allowing you to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
3.  **Select GPT Model**: Once the key is entered, you can select your preferred GPT model from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: This is an older model and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It is available for users on the free plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   **GPT 4.0 (106 Preview)**: This model offers better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It is recommended for users on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

The entire demonstration of the chatbot's functionality was conducted using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

To interact with the Notion Formula Chatbot, you first need to [[api_setup_for_document_automation | place your OpenAI API key]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This API key allows the chatbot to function and provide responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Once the key is entered, you can also select your preferred GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## How to Generate an OpenAI API Key

The first step before using the chatbot is to generate an OpenAI key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

1.  Click on the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find a link that directs you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  Once redirected, locate "Open API Keys" in the left-hand navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  Click on "create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  Fill in any required details and then click "create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  A new key will be generated for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It is crucial to copy this key and save it immediately, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Using the API Key with the Chatbot

After copying your generated API key, paste it into the designated field in the chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A message will confirm that the API key has been entered, allowing you to proceed with asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If the left panel where you enter API keys is not visible, click the arrow on the left side of the chat window to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Understanding OpenAI Models and Credits

When you create an OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This credit can be used for testing the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, but it is limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

The chatbot provides a dropdown menu where you can select between two GPT models:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>: This is an older model and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It is suitable for users on the free OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The entire demonstration video was conducted using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4106 Preview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>: This model offers better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It is recommended for users who are on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

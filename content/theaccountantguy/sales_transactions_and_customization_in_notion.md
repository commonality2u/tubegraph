The Sales Performance OS is a Notion template designed to track and manage sales data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Components

The sales dashboard features three main components under the "sales dashboard" section, providing a detailed overview of performance broken down by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>:

1.  **Salesperson**: Shows sales statistics for each salesperson, including achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of targeted sales received, and whether the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, otherwise "Target not achieved" is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  **Sales Channel**: Represents sales made from various sources (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It tracks sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage of sales, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Sales Location**: Displays sales made to different locations with similar tracking characteristics (achieved, targeted, percentage, status) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Overview Sections

On the left side of the dashboard, there are overview sections that provide aggregated data:

*   **Salesperson Overview**: Shows total sales, sale units (how many units sold), and average sales (sale per unit) for each individual salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview**: Displays total sales, sale units, and average sales for each sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview**: Shows total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

These overviews help track and provide a comprehensive understanding of business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Entering Sales Transactions

Sales transactions are entered in a dedicated window, which mirrors information found in the sales dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

Key fields for entering transactions include:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   **Account Details**: Information about the salesperson or other relevant accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Detail**: Description of what is being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Month** and **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Detail**: Information about the salesperson responsible for the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Client Detail**: Details about the client to whom the sale was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Code**: A unique code specific to each individual making a sale (e.g., "jcore-december23" for James Carter in December 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Target**: The targeted sales amount set at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Sale Amount**: The actual sales amount achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Unit**: The number of units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Setting Sales Targets

Targets can be assigned at the start of each month for salespersons, sales channels, and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. A "Sales Target" quick action button automatically assigns a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

For sales channels, users can input sales channel information, a unique referral code, month, year, sale amount, and referral target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Similarly, for sales locations, users can specify a location tag (unique to the location), location name, month, year, target, and sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

Once details are entered in the salesperson window, the system automatically updates information for specific channels and referral codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Account details for sales channels and locations must be manually fed as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Customization Features

The Sales Performance OS dashboard is highly customizable to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

*   **Editing Salesperson Details**: Users can instantly add new salespersons or modify existing details like names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This can be done directly from the dashboard view by opening a new window to edit details or set a custom cover image for each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Adding Months and Years**: New months can be created for tracking, and specific years can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **[[managing_customer_information_in_notion | Client Details]]**: Client information can be entered and managed via a separate dashboard, including details like address, city, and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization**: The currency of the entire dashboard can be changed to any preferred currency by adjusting the currency sign in relevant columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. This is done by editing the property and changing the number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Filtering Data**: Users can filter the dashboard data by specific years or months using the filter option, allowing for detailed performance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

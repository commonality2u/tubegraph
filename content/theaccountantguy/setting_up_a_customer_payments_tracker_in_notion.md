This template provides a simple solution to keep track of all your customer payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is entirely customizable to suit your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Tracker Layout

The tracker is divided into two main sections:
*   A summary section on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Three distinct sections on the right: Customer, Overview, and Transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Summary Section

The summary section displays key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   Total amount of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The difference between due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Customer Section

This section allows you to set up your entire customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is organized into three default subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Within each subsection, individual customers are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, each displaying the total payment amount due for that customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

#### Customizing Customers and Subsections

*   **Editing Subsections**: To edit any subsection, click on it and begin editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding Subsections**: Click the plus icon to add more subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Editing Payment Amounts**: Click on the amount due for a customer to enter a new amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Editing Customer Names**: Click the pencil icon next to a customer name to edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Adding New Customers**: You can add new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Deleting Customers**: Click the three-dot icon next to a customer and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Overview Section

The overview section displays the total payment received and the total payment amount that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The percentage of payment received shown here is derived from the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Transaction Section

This section is where you record individual payment transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
You can enter the following details for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   Description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Customer name (by selecting from a list of all customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

#### Attaching Documents
A document section is available for attaching specific invoices related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This feature can be useful for [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion|tracking invoice payments]].

Once these transaction details are filled, the payment received amount in the overview and summary sections automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, changing a value in the transaction section will immediately reflect in the payment received totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

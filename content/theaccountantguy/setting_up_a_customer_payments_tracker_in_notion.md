A customer payments tracker in Notion is a simple template designed to help you keep track of all your customer payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Template Layout

The tracker is divided into two main parts:

*   **Summary Section (Left Side)**: This section provides an overview of your payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It displays:
    *   The total amount of payment that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
    *   The payment amount that was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
    *   The difference between the amount due and the amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
    *   The percentage of total payments that was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

*   **Main Sections (Right Side)**: This area contains three primary sections: Customer, Overview, and Transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Sections of the Tracker

### 1. Customer Section

This section allows you to set up and manage your entire customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Subsections**: The customer section is typically divided into three subsections: Regular, Seasonal, and Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   You can edit any existing section by clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   To add a new subsection, click the plus (+) icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Customer Entries**: Under each subsection, individual customers are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Each customer entry includes the total payment amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   To change the due amount, simply click on the existing amount and enter the new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   Customer names can be edited by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   New customers can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Customers can be deleted by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### 2. Overview Section

Once the customer database and due amounts are set up, the overview section shows the total payment received and the payment amount that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### 3. Transaction Section

This section is where you record individual payment transactions, which directly impact the data shown in the overview and summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For each transaction, you can enter:
*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   The customer name (selected from a list of all customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A document section to attach the specific invoice related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

As you fill in these details, the payment amount received updates automatically across the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

This template is entirely customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

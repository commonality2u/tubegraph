This article explains how to [[managing_debts_and_loans_with_notion | manage debt and loan repayments]] using a personal finance tracker set up in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The tracker includes a dedicated debt section for [[monitoring_debt_payment_and_loan_repayment_progress | monitoring debt payment and loan repayment progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts

To begin [[loan_and_repayment_details_management | managing loan and repayment details]], first navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. All debts are classified as liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Adding a New Debt
*   Click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Enter the name of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Specify an opening balance for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   Classify the account under the "Debt" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This is one of four available classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Various frequency options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Editing Existing Debt
*   Click the pencil icon next to the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   Modify any desired options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Recording Debt Transactions

After setting up debt accounts, transactions related to debt payments are entered in the "Liability" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

*   Click "New" to add a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Select the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Transactions are automatically organized by month in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Select the relevant debt account (e.g., Home Loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   Choose the payment mode (e.g., bank or cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   Set the transaction type:
    *   **Outflow**: For repaying a loan, as money is going out of the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Inflow**: For obtaining a new loan, as money is coming into the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Enter the amount of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Entering these transactions automatically updates the total debt amount based on repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The system tracks the initial opening balance, any new loans (inflows), and payments made (outflows) to calculate the current remaining debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments and Progress

To [[tracking_debt_repayments_and_progress | track debt repayments and progress]], navigate to the "Debt" section under the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This section provides an [[understanding_debt_overview_and_summary | understanding of debt overview and summary]], offering two key views:

1.  **Upcoming Payments**:
    *   Shows debts that are due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   Displays the next payment due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   The system uses the set payment frequency to project future due dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   This feature acts as a form of [[automating_loan_repayment_notifications | automating loan repayment notifications]] by indicating when payments are expected.

2.  **Past Payments**:
    *   Lists payments that were due in the past and might have been missed or are overdue for the current period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    *   Helps identify if any payments have been missed based on the last recorded payment date and the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Each debt entry in this view displays:
*   The total loan amount (sum of opening balance and any additional loans/inflows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   The total repayment progress, shown as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   The amount that has been paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

This provides a clear [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | tracking of debt payoff progress]] and an [[debt_overview_and_categorization | overview and categorization]] of all liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Customizing the Debt View

Users can customize the appearance of the debt view:
*   Click the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   Select "Layout" to change the view type (e.g., list, gallery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   Adjust "Properties" to display desired information, such as total amount paid or repayment percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   Set "Group by" to "Payment Status" and "Sorting" to "Manual" to prioritize upcoming payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Managing Debt for Couples

For couples, the Notion tracker can be adapted to manage finances collaboratively. In the "Account" section, different categories of accounts can be split per individual (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. This applies to expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, allowing couples to track individual contributions and responsibilities for debts and loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

## General Features for Debt Management

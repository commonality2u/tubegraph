The employee paycheck tracker template helps categorize employee payments, distinguishing between permanent and contractual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system assists in tracking all employee payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Employee Records

The "records" section provides details about each employee, including whether they are permanent employees, the payments due to them, the number of months of [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | payment]] due, and their [[tracking_pay_rates_for_hourly_and_monthly_payments | payment]] frequency (monthly or hourly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It also records the amount of [[tracking_pay_rates_for_hourly_and_monthly_payments | payment]] being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This section serves as a complete record of all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Quarterly Reporting

The tracker includes a quarterly section that shows the total paycheck due, the amount paid, and the net balance for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | payment]] data is divided into "permanent" and "contractual" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The categorization automatically reflects what is added into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

[[Introduction to PDFOutput tool | PDF Output]] is a tool designed to [[generating_pdf_documents_for_business_purposes | generate PDF documents in bulk]] using Notion templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This functionality is achieved by connecting a Notion template, which defines the structure with elements in curly braces, to a Notion database containing the data to replace those elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[Using PDF Output interface for exporting documents | Generating Bulk PDF Documents]]

The core process of [[creating_pdf_documents_for_business_needs | generating PDF documents]] involves several key steps on the [[PDFOutput software setup for document generation | PDF Output website]]:

### 1. Accessing PDF Output
To begin, users need to navigate to PDFOutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> and log in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 2. Duplicating Notion Template and Database
Before connecting, users must first duplicate the desired Notion template and its corresponding database from the [[Using PDFOutput features and settings | PDF Output]] "Templates" section to their local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For example, for payment receipts, specific template and database links are provided to facilitate this duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### 3. Connecting Notion Database and Template
After logging in, the [[Using PDF Output interface for exporting documents | PDF Output interface]] prompts users to connect a Notion database and a Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This involves:
*   Clicking "Click here to add database" or "Add template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Selecting the specific Notion workspace (e.g., "accountant guy workspace") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Choosing the duplicated template and database from the list and clicking "Allow access" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Optionally, provide a connection name for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   If the database or template doesn't load immediately, clicking "refresh" might help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### 4. Mapping Database Properties to Template Elements
[[Understanding PDF output settings and features | PDF Output]] automatically attempts to map database properties (column names) to template elements (text within curly braces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This automatic mapping works best when the database column names exactly match the template element names, including spacing and capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. If there's a mismatch, users can manually select the correct corresponding element using a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The interface also provides filter, search, and sorting options for properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### 5. Creating and Downloading PDFs
Once mapping is complete, clicking "Create PDF" initiates the generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The tool reads each row from the database and replaces the template elements, generating a separate PDF document for each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Users can then:
*   "Preview a sample" to review one of the generated documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   "Download all documents" to get all generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## [[Troubleshooting and Customization Options in PDF Output | Additional Website Features]]

The [[Customizing and exporting PDF documents with PDF output tool | PDF Output website]] offers several other functionalities accessible via its sidebar:

*   **Connections**: This section displays a list of previously created connections (database-template pairings). Users can click on a saved connection to quickly load the database and template for subsequent PDF generation, avoiding manual re-addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

*   **Templates**: Provides access to a variety of pre-defined templates for different use cases, such as payment receipts and invoices. More templates are expected to be added over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

*   **Upgrade**: Details different subscription plans. The free plan includes a "made with PDF Output" watermark, which can be removed by upgrading to a paid plan, which also offers higher usage limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

*   **Settings**:
    *   **Page format**: Allows users to define the page format for generated PDFs; A4 is the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   **Add more templates**: Provides an option to add additional templates and databases after the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*   **Feedback**: A dedicated window for users to submit questions or feedback directly to the support team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

*   **Help**: Contains instructions on how to use custom PDF documents that are not predefined templates, offering flexibility beyond the provided templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The sidebar can also be collapsed using a small arrow icon for a more streamlined view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. For direct assistance, users can contact notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

A [[using_a_business_plan_template | business plan template]] can include an events timeline, which provides a visual, calendar-based view of your business planning activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This feature offers a quick overview of planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Overview of the Events Timeline

The events timeline displays information from the [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

It provides details such as:
*   **Specific deadline dates** The timeline reflects the set dates for various stages of the business plan, for example, showing a period like December 3 to December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Stage name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   **Associated tasks** for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   **Status of tasks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   **Necessary properties** specified for all stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

An arrow icon is present on the timeline, which also reflects the dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Clicking on these arrows directs you to the specific date, allowing you to view detailed information for all stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

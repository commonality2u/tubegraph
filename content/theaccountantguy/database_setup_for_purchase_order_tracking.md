This article details the setup and utilization of a database for tracking purchase orders, designed to help monitor expenses and manage order information efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This [[purchase_order_tracker_template_in_notion|purchase order tracker template]] provides a structured way to input, manage, and summarize purchase data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Core Database Columns

The purchase order tracker database includes several key columns to capture comprehensive order details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

*   **Purchase Order Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Order Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Expected Delivery Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Terms and Conditions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Company Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

*   **Description**: Details of the items being purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Multiple description columns can be added by duplicating existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

If additional description/quantity/price columns are added, the subtotal formula needs to be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Shipping Cost**: An additional field to include shipping expenses in the total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Purchase Order Summary and [[client_purchase_summary_and_kpi_tracking|KPI Tracking]]

At the top of the database, a summary section provides key performance indicators (KPIs) for your purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:

*   **Total Purchase**: The summation of all purchases recorded in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units Ordered**: Calculated from the combined quantities of all items across all purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Average Order Value**: Derived by dividing the total purchases by the total units ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Client Summary

The database also features a [[client_purchase_summary_and_kpi_tracking|client summary]] that breaks down purchase data by specific clients, such as ABC Solutions, XYZ Manufacturing, and LMN Enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. For each client, it displays:

*   Total quantities ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Average order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

The Investment Portfolio tracker is designed to help users organize and monitor their financial holdings, with a strong emphasis on [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | categorizing and classifying]] investments for clarity and effective management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Investment Section Overview

The tracker's investment section is structured to allow users to add and manage their individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It initially provides default categories such as "Stocks" and "Cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Users have the flexibility to create and add their own custom categories as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

For each investment added, users input its opening balance and opening units, typically reflecting the state at the beginning of a financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Portfolio Section Display

Once investments are added, the portfolio section provides a consolidated view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This section displays the same investments, [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | classified]] under their respective categories (e.g., Stocks, Cryptos, or user-defined groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Key features in the portfolio section include:
*   **Investment Value and Units** The current value and units of each investment after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Investment Percentage** An indicator showing the proportion of a specific investment relative to the total investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Section** Displays the total profit or loss for each individual investment after all transactions are accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. There is also a summation of profit or loss for each category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Categories

The tracker offers convenient ways to manage investment categories:
*   **Adding New Investments and Classifying Them** New investments can be quickly added using a "quick action button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When adding details, an investment may initially be listed under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Users can then easily move and [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | classify]] it under an existing category like "Stocks" or "Crypto" by selecting the appropriate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Creating New Categories (Groups)** To establish a new investment category, users can click a plus icon and create a new group, such as "Bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This action automatically adds a new section for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories** Existing investment items or categories can be edited by clicking on them and typing in the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Transaction Management

The tracker also includes a comprehensive transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. While transactions themselves are not *categorized* in the same way as investments, they are directly linked to specific investments (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This means that all buy and sell activities contribute to the overall profit/loss and unit count of the underlying categorized investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

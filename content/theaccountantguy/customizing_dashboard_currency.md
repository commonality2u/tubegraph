The subscription expenses tracker allows users to track all their subscription expenses and offers options for [[customizing_currency_and_formats_in_notion | currency customization]] within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Users can change the currency displayed in the dashboard to suit their preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

A quick tutorial on how to change the currency is included underneath the tracker itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This allows for the display of different currencies as per the user's choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

[[using_notion_for_expense_management | Using Notion for expense management]] allows for efficient tracking of business expenses, such as those for restaurant operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A dedicated Notion template organizes expenses into categories, displays budgeted and actual spending, and provides dynamic updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Expense Categories Overview

The template typically displays three distinct expense categories at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Each category has a budgeted expense value, and the actual expenses are automatically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A percentage indicator shows the actual expenses incurred in comparison to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Modifying Existing Categories

To change an existing expense category name, click on the pencil icon associated with that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Any modifications made will automatically update within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Expenses

To define or adjust a budgeted expense for any category, simply click on the value displayed, and you can enter a new budget as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Adding New Categories

If you need to add a new expense category, click on the "new page" option within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This allows for [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | setting up categories in a Notion expense tracker]].

### Deleting Categories

To remove an expense category, click on the three-dot icon next to the category, and then select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The category will be removed from the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## [[dynamic_updates_of_expense_values_in_notion | Dynamic Updates of Expense Values in Notion]]

One of the key features of this template is its [[dynamic_updates_of_expense_values_in_notion | dynamic updates of expense values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Whenever new expense figures are entered into the system, all associated expense values, including the summary section, are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The summary section provides a quick overview, showing:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Total actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and actual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

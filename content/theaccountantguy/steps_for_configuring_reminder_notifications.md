This guide outlines the process for setting up automated bill payment reminders on WhatsApp, ensuring [[ensuring_timely_payments_through_automated_reminders | timely payments through automated reminders]] via [[customizing_recurring_payment_notifications | customizing recurring payment notifications]]. The process involves creating a new reminder template and integrating with an automation platform like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Creating a New Bill Payment Reminder Template

To set up a new [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | bill payment reminder]] on WhatsApp, you first need to [[creating_templates_for_automated_payment_notifications | create a new template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

1.  **Access Template Options**: Click on the available drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  **Select New Template**: Choose "new template" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  **Enter Bill Details**:
    *   **Bill Name**: Start by writing the name of your bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   **Bill Amount**: Specify the amount due for the bill, such as "$1,500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Setting Up Recurring Notifications

After creating the initial template, you can configure it to repeat on a recurring basis, enabling [[using_templates_for_recurring_bill_notifications | recurring bill notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

1.  **Access Recurring Settings**: Click on the drop-down again, then select the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Set Recurrence**: Choose the desired frequency for the reminder, for instance, "every month" for a mobile bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  **Specify Notification Time**: Define the exact time you wish to receive the notification, such as "11:55" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  **Set Day of Month**: Indicate which day of the month the notification should be sent, for example, "every 20th of every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
5.  **Save Settings**: Click "Save" to apply the recurring notification settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This ensures the notification will repeat every month on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation and Notification Delivery

To automate the sending of these reminders to WhatsApp, the system leverages an automation tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **Automation Setup**: The entire automation workflow is configured within Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for this setup are provided when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Automatic Notifications**: Once this automation is set up, you will automatically receive notifications on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. If a [[creating_templates_for_automated_payment_notifications | template]] is configured for recurring payments (e.g., monthly), notifications will be sent automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Notification Timing**: The system is designed to send notifications very close to the specified time, typically within a minute of the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For example, a notification set for 11:55 AM on September 20th would be received around 11:56 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This setup ensures you receive a WhatsApp notification for every bill added to the system and set for recurring monthly reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

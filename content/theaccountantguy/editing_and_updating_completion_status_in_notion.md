This article explains how to utilize a business plan template in Notion to manage and track the completion status of various business planning stages and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Business Plan Template Overview

The business plan template offers two primary views:
*   **Business Plan Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **[[managing_events_with_notion | Events Timeline]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template includes 11 predefined stages, such as "Conceptional Research" and "Planning and Structuring," extending to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Editing Stages and Objectives
Users can edit the names of the business plan roadmap stages by clicking on a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For each stage, objectives can be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The stage to which an objective corresponds can also be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Managing Tasks within Stages
Clicking on any stage in the roadmap reveals a detailed view, showcasing the tasks associated with that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Task Deadlines:** Each task has a specified deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox:** A checkbox indicates whether a task is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Assigning Status:** Once the checkbox is marked, a status can be assigned to the task as per requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Adding New Tasks:** New tasks can be added for a specific stage by clicking the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Documentation:** At the bottom of each stage's view, there is a section for documentation where objectives and tasks can be detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Updating Completion Status and Percentage

The template automatically updates the completion percentage for each stage based on completed tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is marked complete, the completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   If both tasks are completed, the status becomes 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   This percentage updates automatically once the completion checkbox is clicked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Events Timeline View

The [[managing_events_with_notion | events timeline]] provides a calendar and timeline format view of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   It displays specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Users can see the stage name, associated tasks, dates, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Arrows indicate specific dates, and clicking them navigates to the detailed view of the stages and their properties for that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

This template helps in planning and tracking business progress efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

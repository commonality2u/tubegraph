This article details how to utilize a [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | debt payment tracker]] in Notion to manage and pay off outstanding debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview, track payments, and offer insights into debt payoff progress.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section categorizes debts for clear organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Debts can be divided into various payment schedules, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key details tracked for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details:** Description of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount:** The initial principal amount of the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount:** The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate:** The specified interest rate for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment:** The first date an installment will be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A calculated date indicating when the debt will be fully repaid if payments continue as specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs:** The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Managing Debt Categories and Entries

### Adding New Categories
Users can add new payment categories (e.g., "Weekly") by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The template typically includes annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly repayment schedules for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Moving Debts
Existing debt items can be moved between different repayment schedules (e.g., from monthly to quarterly) by dragging and dropping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This action automatically updates the repayment schedule and associated calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debt Details
*   To quickly add a new debt, click the "added details" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This new entry will appear in a "no payment frequency" column until a category is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the "debt" field and typing in new information, which updates across all relevant columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

The "Debt Payoff Progress" section provides a summary of all loans added and reflects the total amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This section includes:
*   **Total Amount Repaid:** Sum of all EMI installments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage:** The percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A quick reference to the projected debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount:** The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount:** The total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every payment is split into these two components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction Section" allows for the detailed recording of debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installments
This sub-section reflects all paid debts, organized by month with the latest month at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It provides a quick summation of all EMIs paid for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

For each payment, users can:
*   **Mark as Paid:** A checkbox to signify if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Ticking this moves the entry to the "Paid Installment" section, while unticking moves it to "Unpaid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Payment Date:** Record the date of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan Details:** Select the specific loan to which the payment applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment:** Enter the amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule:** Automatically calculated based on the loan's payment frequency (e.g., a monthly student loan payment on Sept 30 will show the next payment on Oct 30; an annual home loan payment on Sept 27, 2023, will show the next payment on Sept 27, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

To add a new debt payment to the schedule, click the "pay debt amount" button, which adds an entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Users can then fill in the details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Automatic Updates

The tracker is designed to automatically update all sections once details are added or changed. For example, if a payment amount for a student loan is changed, the "total amount repaid" in the "Debt Payoff Progress" section will instantly reflect the new sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This ensures all financial overviews and calculations remain current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

An Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy, demonstrates how to utilize a monthly budget planner in Notion to begin [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting]] for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tool is designed to help users understand their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Monthly Budget Planner Views

The Notion monthly budget planner template features four distinct views, providing comprehensive financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>: This view provides a summary of different expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: This section categorizes expenses by month, allowing users to see all expenses at a glance in a monthly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: Similar to the monthly overview, this view presents the same expense information but in an annual format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: This section provides a complete overview of all expenses booked in a year, clued together to show overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Utilizing the Expense Details Database

To use the planner, users interact with the "expense details database" where all financial information is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

All expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024), which will automatically adjust the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., Wi-Fi expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users can add custom periods if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the category (e.g., "Utilities"). Four default categories are provided, but users can add their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This step is part of [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customizing expense categories and budgeting in Notion]].
7.  Input an expense code, which helps segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### [[setting_financial_goals_in_notion | Setting Financial Goals in Notion]]: Setting Budgets

At the beginning of each month, users have the option to [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | customize budget templates in Notion]] by setting a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
To set a budget:
1.  Select the date, typically the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period and year, similar to entering an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Choose the category (e.g., "Food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Note that the expense name and category name should be the same when setting a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  Set the expense code based on the category and month (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  Enter the budget amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once an expense or budget is entered, all figures in the overview sections are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This allows users to continually track their financial progress throughout the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

After booking all expenses, the Notion template enables deeper financial analysis through its various views and properties:

*   **Period Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., Feb 2024) opens a detailed view showing all booked transactions, their amounts, and whether they were recorded as an expense or a budget amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This provides a quick glance at financial activity for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Year Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>: Similarly, clicking on a year displays the total budgeted amount, expenses, expense as a percentage of budget, and the budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also lists all transactions for the year, along with their respective amounts and whether they were an expense or a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Category Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>: By selecting a category, users can view the total expense and budgeted amounts for that category, the expense as a percentage, and the status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It also lists all transactions related to that specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This is crucial for [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customizing expense categories and budgeting in Notion]].
*   **Expense Code Tracking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: The expense code allows users to see how much has been spent for a particular category within a specific month, compared to the allocated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

By regularly entering transactions and [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | customizing budget templates in Notion]], users can effectively track and analyze their financial situation using these detailed views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This method simplifies [[managing_finances_with_notion | managing finances with Notion]] and ensures clear visibility into spending habits.

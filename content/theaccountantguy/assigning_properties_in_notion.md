## Assigning Properties in Notion

The process of finding the difference between two numbers in Notion involves setting up a database and assigning specific properties to its columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Initial Database Setup

To begin, create a new database by typing a forward slash and selecting "database" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The initial property in a newly created database is typically the title property, which signifies the purpose of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Assigning Number Properties

After the title property, it is necessary to [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | assign number properties]] to at least two different columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These number properties will hold the values for which the difference needs to be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Using Formula Properties

To find the difference between the assigned numbers, a [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] property is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Two methods can be used within the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]]:
*   **Subtract Operator**: This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if "Number 1" and "Number 2" are provided as inputs, the formula using the subtract operator will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Minus Sign**: Similarly, a minus sign can be directly used within a [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] to find the difference between the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The business budget template features a [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | transaction section]] at the bottom, specifically designed for booking expenses under various categories [00:01:33]. This section plays a crucial role in maintaining an accurate budget by updating the overall business expenses summary [00:00:51].

## Overview of the Transaction Section

Within the [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | transaction section]], expenses are itemized and batched by month [00:01:44]. The most recent months typically appear at the top [00:01:47].

## Adding and Managing Expenses

The template offers several methods for [[adding_and_managing_expenses | adding and managing expenses]]:

### Quick Buttons for Expense Entry

To quickly add an expense, users can utilize the buttons located on the left side of the [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | transaction section]] [00:01:49]. For instance, clicking an "operational expense" button will automatically add a new entry with the current date [00:01:53].

### Entering Expense Details

Once an expense entry is created, details can be input:
*   **Description** [00:02:02]
*   **Account Association**: Expenses can be associated with relevant accounts previously set up in the account section [00:02:06].
*   **Amount** [00:02:11]

### Modifying Entry Dates

The date of an expense can be easily adjusted by clicking on the date field and selecting a new date as required [00:02:23]. This change automatically updates the record [00:02:30].

### Adding New Accounts/Categories

The template also provides options to add new accounts or categories directly:
*   A "quick button" at the top allows for adding different expense sources [00:02:40].
*   Alternatively, a "new" icon [00:02:50] or button [00:02:59] can be used to add a new account under a specific category, such as "operation" [00:02:57]. Users can then input details and a budgeted amount for the new account [00:03:00].

By regularly [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | tracking and entering transactions]] in this section, businesses can effectively monitor their spending and ensure they stay within their allocated budget [00:03:08].

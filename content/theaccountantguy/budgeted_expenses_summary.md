The paycheck budget tracker is designed to help users [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | track expenses]] and manage their budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The primary goal is to ensure users stay on top of their finances by keeping [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | budgeted payments]] in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Summary Section

The left side of the tracker features a dedicated summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This section provides a concise [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of your financial status]] related to expenses and budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

It displays key metrics:
*   **Total Budgeted Expenses** The total amount of expenses that have been set in the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Total Expenses Incurred** The actual total expenses that have been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Difference** The variance between the total budgeted expenses and the total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[budget_versus_actual_expense_tracking | tracking budgeted vs actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budgeted Expense** This metric shows what percentage of the budgeted expense has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This calculation helps in understanding how much of the allocated budget has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, providing insight into [[calculating_expense_differences_and_budget_percentages | budget utilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This allows for continuous [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | monitoring of expenses against the budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This article details how to utilize a Notion template for [[notion_template_for_inventory_tracking | inventory tracking]] in a small business, as demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The template is designed to help users monitor inventory levels, manage transactions, and understand profit and loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio

The inventory portfolio is the central hub for managing inventory and offers three distinct views: Inventory Setup, Inventory Portfolio, and Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Inventory Setup

The Inventory Setup section allows users to categorize inventory into three classifications:
*   **Raw Materials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Work in Progress** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Finished Goods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

Each inventory item has several configurable properties:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle**: Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), or WAC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This can be left as default if not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level**: The unit level at which reordering of the inventory is triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn, 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Adding new inventory is straightforward:
1.  Click the "Add Inventory" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  The new item appears in the "No Classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Click the three dots next to the item and drag it to the desired category (e.g., Work in Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  Click the pencil icon to input its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Inventory Portfolio View

This view displays the current status of your inventory after all transactions:
*   **Inventory Value**: The value of the inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available**: The total units remaining after purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level**: This property alerts the user if stock levels fall below the predefined reorder level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   For example, if wheat's reorder level is 60 units, and only 30 units are available, a "low stock" message appears, indicating a need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Conversely, if corn's reorder level is 10 units and 70 units are available, a message indicates the item is "available in Surplus" and does not need reordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Inventory Status

This view tracks the physical status or location of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Statuses include:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Other custom statuses can be added or edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

For instance, if a corn purchase of 50 units is "in transit," this status will be reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Similarly, if a sales item is "not sent," that status is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Users can easily change an item's status by clicking the three dots next to it and selecting a new status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section manages purchases and sales, and calculates profit and loss for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases

Purchase transactions can be added and viewed, categorized by month, with later dates appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Key fields for a purchase transaction include:
*   **Date**: Transactions are automatically bifurcated by month (e.g., August, July, September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Account**: Link to a specific inventory item (e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Number of Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Purchase Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status**: Assign the status of the particular transaction (e.g., In Transit, Received) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

A quick action button labeled "Buy Inventory" automatically adds a new purchase transaction to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Sales

Similar to purchases, a sales section is available to track inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit and Loss

For each sale, users input the sale price and the cost of the item to automatically calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   For example, if bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost or purchase price was $10, the template calculates a $30 profit per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If 30 units were sold, the total profit would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

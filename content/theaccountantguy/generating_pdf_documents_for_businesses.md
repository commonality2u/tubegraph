PDF Output is a solution available at PDFoutput.com designed for [[creating_and_exporting_pdf_documents_for_business | creating PDF documents for businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Key Features and Workflow

### Selecting Templates and Currency
Upon logging in, users can select a specific template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For example, an invoice template can be chosen, along with a preferred currency from several available options, such as the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Single PDF Generation
To [[generating_pdf_documents_from_invoices | generate a single PDF document]], users fill in the required details related to the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. After inputting all information, clicking "Download PDF" automatically creates the PDF document based on the filled-in data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The generated invoice will be ready quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The currency can be changed, and re-downloading the PDF will update the invoice to the new currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | Bulk PDF Generation]]
For [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents_in_bulk | exporting PDF documents in bulk]], users can switch to the "Bulk Export Mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In this mode, details are entered into a database table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This database includes fields such as invoice number and invoice date, mirroring the fields from the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Once the database is filled, users click "Download All PDF" to [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | generate PDF documents one by one]] for each entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. For example, three PDF documents can be generated simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The bulk-generated PDFs maintain the same format as those created in single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Users can also choose to download a PDF for a specific individual row if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Future Enhancements
The platform currently supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. There are plans to add a Notion database feature, which would allow users to add details to their Notion database and export documents directly from PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. More templates will be added in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Users can request specific templates or provide feedback through designated links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

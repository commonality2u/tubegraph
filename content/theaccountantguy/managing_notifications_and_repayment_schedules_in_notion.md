The credit card expenses tracker in Notion includes dedicated features to help users [[managing_debts_and_loans_with_notion | manage debts]] by tracking upcoming repayments and ensuring timely payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system allows for effective [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | debt tracking]] and oversight of financial obligations.

## Notification Section Overview
The tracker prominently features a "notification section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This section displays:
*   When the next repayment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   How many days remain until the next repayment date for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Setting Repayment Dates
Users can customize their repayment schedules within the notification section:
*   **Setting Dates** Users can set their own repayment dates by clicking on the designated field and selecting any date of their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Per Credit Card Tracking** For each individual credit card added to the system, the repayment date can be set as the user progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The system then automatically calculates and displays the number of days pending until the next repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Benefits of the Notification System
This integrated notification system helps users:
*   Always track their credit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   See upcoming repayment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Pay credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The overall template facilitates [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | managing accounts and transactions]] by providing a clear overview of financial obligations and deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

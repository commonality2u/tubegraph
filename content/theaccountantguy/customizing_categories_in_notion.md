The Notion Expenses Tracker allows users to [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | categorize expenses]] for comprehensive tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This [[customizing_notion_templates | template]] can manage all expenses in one place, whether for personal or business use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The entire [[customizing_notion_templates | template]] is fully [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable]] to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Managing Expense Categories

The tracker features a category section at the top, initially showing three different [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each category can be defined to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Renaming Categories

To rename a category:
1.  Hover over the desired category until a pencil icon appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
3.  Rename the category as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
4.  Press Enter to save the new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Deleting Categories

To delete or edit existing [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]]:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  Select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Adding New Categories

To add a new category:
1.  Click on "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  A new category can then be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Category Data and Functionality

For each category, there is both a budgeted [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amount and an actual [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses

The summary section provides an overview, showing the budgeted [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amount alongside the actual [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expenses]] amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The actual [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expenses]] are calculated from the detailed table below the categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The summary also displays the difference between the two and the percentage of the [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | budget]] spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Users can set their own budgeted [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amounts by clicking on the budget [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amount within the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Changing these figures updates the total [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | budget]] and all related figures in the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates

When [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expense]] amounts are entered into the tracker, all [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] are automatically updated with the respective [[expense_details_and_categorization_in_notion | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

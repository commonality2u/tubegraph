This guide demonstrates how to set up [[setting_up_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]] using a database to receive timely notifications [00:00:07].

## Setting Up a New Reminder Template

To begin, you will create a [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | new template]] for your payment reminder:
1.  Click on the provided drop-down menu [00:00:23].
2.  Select the option to create a "new template" [00:00:25].
3.  Choose the "subscription reminder alert" option [00:00:28].
4.  Input the name of the subscription, for example, "Spotify" [00:00:32].
5.  Specify the subscription amount, such as $150 [00:00:37].
6.  Click "background" to add the new template [00:00:41].

## Configuring Repetition for Reminders

Once the template is added, configure its [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | repetition]]:
1.  Locate the newly added template and click on the three dots next to it [00:00:48].
2.  Select "repeat" [00:00:51].
3.  Choose the desired mode of repetition, such as "every month" [00:00:55]. This ensures the reminder for the specified amount repeats monthly [00:01:00].
4.  A new window will appear, allowing you to set the specific time and start date for the repetition [00:01:11].
    *   For instance, if today is September 23rd, you can set the reminder time to 11:56 [00:01:18].
    *   Confirm that the reminder repeats "every month on 23rd" at 11:56 [00:01:30].
5.  Click "Save" [00:01:38]. A repetition arrow will indicate that the alert is set to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 [00:01:40].

## Receiving Notifications

Once configured, the system will automatically add a new line item in the database at the specified time on the designated day [00:01:54]. Subsequently, you will receive the notification alert on your [[setting_up_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] [00:02:01].

The WhatsApp notification will remind you to pay the subscription amount, for example, "$150 for Spotify" [00:02:27]. It also includes a "pay now" link to facilitate direct payment [00:02:31].

## Customization of Reminder Alerts

The reminder alert received on [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] is entirely [[customizing_reminder_messages_and_payment_details | customizable]] to meet individual requirements [00:03:00]. There is no fixed template, and upon downloading the [[notion_template_for_invoice_payment_reminders | Notion template]], instructions and guides are available to help set up the automation independently [00:03:12].

This process allows you to set up any subscription payment reminder alert directly from the [[notion_template_for_invoice_payment_reminders | Notion database]], ensuring timely payment of subscription amounts [00:02:43].

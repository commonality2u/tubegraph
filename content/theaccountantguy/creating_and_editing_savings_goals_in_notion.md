The Notion savings funds tracker template provides a [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_dashboard_in_notion | savings funds dashboard]] that allows users to [[customizing_fund_categories_and_goals_in_notion | set and track various savings goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This dashboard features two main views: "Savings Target" for setting goals and "Savings Overview" for tracking progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tool is part of a broader system for [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | Notion for personal finance tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Savings Target View

Under the "Savings Target" view, users can define different saving funds and their corresponding target or goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The template comes with three default savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To edit an existing savings fund:
1.  Click the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., from a default name to "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The name change will automatically update across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  Click on the goal amount to set a new target (e.g., changing from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This update will automatically reflect in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Alternatively, you can click directly on the entry to open a detailed view where you can edit the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon or the entry itself to name the new fund (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Set the desired goal amount for the new fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For example, setting it to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

To delete a savings fund:
1.  Click the six dots that appear on the left side of the fund's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option from the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Savings Overview

The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of your total savings, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Changes made in the "Savings Target" view automatically update this overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Transactions Panel

To add savings to a specific fund, use the "Transactions" panel at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Adding a New Transaction
1.  Click "Add Transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  Transactions are grouped by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  Enter a description for the saving (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific fund from a dropdown list of all previously added saving funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  Input the saving amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This amount will automatically update the total savings for that fund and the overall progress shown in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For example, adding $1,000 to a car fund with $1,400 already saved will update the total to $2,400, reflecting 80% of a $3,000 goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Customization Options

### Currency Customization
The template supports different currencies. To change the currency format for any amount:
1.  Click on the amount with the dollar currency symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired currency from the "Number Format" options, which reflect all currencies Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Dynamic Transaction Views
The transaction view can be dynamically changed to group savings by different timeframes:
1.  Click the three dots next to the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Go to "Grouping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  Change the "Date" grouping from "Month" to "Week" or "Year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This will dynamically re-organize the transactions accordingly (e.g., showing 2023 and 2024 as different years or displaying weekly savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This template is fully dynamic and customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. For further assistance, contact for_my_use@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

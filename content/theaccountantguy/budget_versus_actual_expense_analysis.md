A Film Production budget tracker template can be utilized to [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | keep track of all expenses]] related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template allows for a comprehensive [[budget_summary_and_tracking | summary and analysis of project expenses]] by comparing budgeted amounts with actual expenditures.

## Template Overview
The template includes a table that lists individual expenses with their respective categories and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Expense and Category Management
*   **Expense Entry** The amount for an expense can be entered directly into the template, with updates reflected dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Category Definition** Users can define their own expense categories using a pencil icon, and these updates are reflected in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Value Updates** The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the template, with all changes reflected instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Category Actions** New categories can be added using a "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, existing ones can be edited with a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and categories can be deleted via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Summary and Analysis
The summary section of the template provides a detailed [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget versus actual expense tracking]] analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses relative to the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

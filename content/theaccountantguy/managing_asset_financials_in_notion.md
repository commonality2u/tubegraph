Notion can be used as an asset planner to manage various details related to assets, including their financial aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An asset planner template typically includes an [[operational_management_of_assets_using_notion | operational management]] section that covers asset details, maintenance, financials, and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Financial Details

Within the operational management section, a dedicated area handles the financial details related to the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This section typically displays:
*   The current value of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   The depreciation method being applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   The depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Other Integrated Sections

While focusing on financials, the asset planner also integrates with other crucial aspects of asset management:

### Asset Details
This area allows users to track fundamental information such as asset ID, asset name, and asset type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Maintenance
The template includes a [[asset_maintenance_tracking_with_notion | maintenance]] section that covers maintenance ID, asset ID, and other relevant maintenance details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Performance
The asset planner also allows for tracking the performance of the asset as it is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Regulatory Management & Compliance
A "regulatory management" section helps with compliance, ensuring all related requirements are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Documentation
Users can add all relevant documents related to the asset in a dedicated documentation section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Reviews
A review section enables users to add their opinions or feedback about the assets being utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

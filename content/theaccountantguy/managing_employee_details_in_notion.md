The employee schedule template in [[customizing_notion_templates_for_employee_scheduling | Notion]] can be utilized to keep track of the schedules of all employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template offers four distinct views to manage various aspects of employee scheduling and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Template Views

The four main views within this Notion template are:
*   **Employee Details:** Lists employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule:** Helps enter tasks for employees based on dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Monthly View:** Shows monthly performance divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance:** Displays exact performance information broken down by employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Employee Details Section

This section allows for the management of individual employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Adding New Employees
To add a new employee, click on the "new" button and fill in the relevant categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Alternatively, a quick action button labeled "add employee" on the top can automatically add a new employee entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

When adding a new employee, you can enter:
*   Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Employee ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

## Task Schedule Section

After adding employee details, the task schedule section is used to input task-related information for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Shift Management
Tasks are divided into different shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Employees can enter details according to their assigned shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Task Details
For each task, users can specify:
*   **Start Time:** Including desired date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **End Time:** With an indication of the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Task Detail:** Information about the specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Employee Assignment:** Select an employee by name; the respective department will auto-populate from the employee details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. New employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Hours Worked:** Auto-computes based on the entered start and end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Attendance:** Employees can mark themselves as present, on leave, or having a day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Task Status:** Employees can update the status to "in progress," "completed," or "not started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In cases of leave or day off, the status can be marked as "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Monthly View

The monthly view provides an overview of employee performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It divides months into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> and displays:
*   Total hours worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Total hours (summation of working hours and leave hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

This view offers a quick summary of monthly performance and how employees have performed overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Employee Performance Section

For a detailed individual breakdown, the employee performance section shows the same information as the monthly view but organized by employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Here, you can see for each employee:
*   Hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Hours on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

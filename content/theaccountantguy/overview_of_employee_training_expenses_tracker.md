The Employee Training Expenses Tracker is a tool designed to manage and monitor training activities and associated costs within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It provides a comprehensive dashboard with various views to track training overviews, employee records, and detailed expense information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Training Dashboard

The main dashboard offers two primary views: [[tracking_and_updating_attendance_and_training_dates | Training Overview]] and Employee Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Training Overview

This section provides a summary of all planned trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each individual training, it displays:

*   The employee count (number of employees supposed to attend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The percentage of attendance (how many employees attended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The training expense incurred for that specific training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

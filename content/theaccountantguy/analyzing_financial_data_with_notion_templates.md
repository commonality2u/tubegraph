This article explores how a [[notion_finance_templates_overview | monthly budget planner Notion template]] can be utilized to analyze financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template is designed to provide various views and tools for tracking and understanding spending patterns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Key Views for Financial Analysis

The template offers four primary views for analyzing financial information:
*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Summary of All Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview
This view presents a breakdown of different expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays:
*   The total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   The budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   The percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether spending is over or under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly and Yearly Overviews
These views present the same expense data organized by month and year, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This allows users to see all expenses at a glance for a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides a complete overview of expenses in a yearly format, consolidating all expenses to give a comprehensive view of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering and Categorizing Data
All financial information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

To enter a transaction:
1.  Click "new" and input the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The month will automatically adjust based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense detail, such as "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
3.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") and the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
4.  Choose the expense category (e.g., "utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Custom categories can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
5.  Input an expense code, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
6.  Enter the expense amount in the designated column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Setting Monthly Budgets
The template allows users to set budgets for specific expenses at the start of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This is done by entering the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column, distinct from the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. For budget entries, the "expense name" and "category name" typically remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Setting a budget automatically updates the financial figures in the overview sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## In-Depth Financial Analysis
After booking expenses, the template offers various ways to extract and analyze data, contributing to [[utilizing_notion_for_financial_summaries_and_budgeting | financial summaries and budgeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:

### Analysis by Period
Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window displaying all transactions booked for that period, detailing the amount and whether it was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This provides a quick glance at monthly financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Analysis by Year
Similarly, clicking on a year provides a view showing the budgeted amount, expenses amount, expense as a percentage of budget, and budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also lists all transactions for that year, along with their amounts and whether they were budget or expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Analysis by Category
Users can also analyze expenses by category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This view shows the expense amount, budgeted amount, expense as a percentage of budget, and status for a particular category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It also lists all category-related expenses that have been booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Analysis by Expense Code
The expense code allows for granular analysis, showing how much has been booked for a specific category of expense within a particular month, compared to the total budget for that combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, all these views are automatically updated, providing a dynamic overview of financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This approach leverages the [[components_of_a_notion_finance_template | components of a Notion finance template]] to offer comprehensive financial tracking and analysis.

## Customization and Support
This template can be further customized to fit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For additional questions or assistance, support can be reached via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

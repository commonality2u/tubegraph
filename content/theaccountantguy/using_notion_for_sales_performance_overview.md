The Sales Performance OS is a Notion template designed to provide a comprehensive overview of sales data, enabling users to track performance across different dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This tool helps in managing sales performance in a [[using Notion for business management | business]] setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Components

The sales dashboard at the top of the template features three primary components, all of which can be divided by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>:

### Salesperson Performance
This section tracks the sales made by individual salespersons each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For each person, it displays:
*   Sales achieved for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>
*   Targeted sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>
*   Percentage of targeted sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>
*   Status indicating if the target was met ("Target achieved" for sales exceeding target, "Target not achieved" for sales below target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>

### Sales Channel Performance
This component identifies the various sources from which sales have been made, such as a website, Instagram, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. It provides similar metrics to the salesperson performance: sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### Sales Location Performance
This section details where sales have been generated geographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, presenting the same characteristic metrics as the other two components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Sales Overview Sections

The left sidebar provides aggregated overviews for each dimension:

*   **Salesperson Overview**: Shows total sales, sale units, and average sales per unit for each individual salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview**: Displays total sales, sale units, and average sales for each different sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview**: Provides total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

These overviews help in tracking and understanding the overall performance of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Managing Sales Transactions

The sales transactions section allows for detailed entry of each sale, mirroring the dashboard's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
Users input the following details for each transaction:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   Account Details (e.g., salesperson info) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>
*   Sales Details (what is being sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   Month and Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>
*   Salesperson Detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>
*   [[Using Notion for client management | Client detail]] (to whom the sale was made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>
*   Sales Code (unique to each individual making a sale, e.g., "J_Dec23" for James Carter's December 2023 sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>
*   Sales Target (set at the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
*   Sales Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>
*   Sales Unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>

### Setting Targets and Adding Information
Targets can be set at the beginning of each month for salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   For sales channels, users input the channel information, referral code, month, year, sale amount, and referral target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   For sales locations, users specify a unique location tag (location name, month, year), target, and sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

Quick action buttons on the left allow for automatic target assignment for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> and quick transaction entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

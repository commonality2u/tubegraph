*   "Past Payments" shows subscriptions for which a payment was due in the past but hasn't been recorded, indicating a potential missed payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.
*   The view also displays the total amount paid so far and the subscription's status (e.g., active) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>.
*   If a newly added account's subscription status isn't visible, it can be enabled by clicking the pencil icon and selecting "Subscription Status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:00]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

The tracker allows for [[using_notion_to_track_net_worth | tracking net worth]] and [[setting_net_worth_goals_and_tracking_progress | setting net worth goals]].

### Understanding Net Worth

Net worth is defined as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities at the end of a financial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.

### Setting Net Worth Goals

To set a net worth goal:
1.  Navigate to the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>.
2.  Specify your target net worth amount that you aim to achieve by the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>. This value can be easily modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>.

### Net Worth Summary

The [[monthly_net_worth_overview_and_changes | Net Worth]] section under "Summary" provides a comprehensive overview:
*   **Net Worth Goal:** Displays your set financial target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth:** This is the calculated net worth, representing total assets minus total liabilities after all transactions have been entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. For example, if total assets are $5,630 and liabilities are $1,300, the net worth is $4,330 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.
*   **Difference:** Shows how much you are "lagging behind" your net worth goal, calculated as the goal minus the current total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved:** Reflects the percentage of your net worth goal that has been achieved so far (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.
*   **Total Growth:** This measures the growth from the opening net worth (beginning of the financial year) to the current closing net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:00">[34:19:00]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the initial balances specified in the "Account" section for assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:28:00">[34:28:00]</a>.

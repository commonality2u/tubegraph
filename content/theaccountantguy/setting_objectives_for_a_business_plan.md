A dedicated [[using_a_business_plan_template | business plan template]] offers structured views to facilitate business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template typically features two main views: the [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] and the [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Defining Objectives within the Business Plan Road Map

The [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] breaks down the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template provides 11 pre-defined stages, such as "conceptional research," "planning and structuring," and "profitability and scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These stages can be customized as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Objectives for the business plan can be set on the right side of the [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Each objective can be explicitly linked to a specific stage of the business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Detailed Objective and Task Management

When examining individual stages, such as "planning and structuring," the template allows for a detailed view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Here, users can define the objective for that specific stage, for example, "blueprint business plan" for the "planning and structuring" stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Associated with each stage's objective are various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Each task can have a specified deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, a completion checkbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, and a status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. New tasks can be added directly within the stage view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Tracking Progress Towards Objectives

The template automatically tracks the completion percentage for each stage based on the tasks marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, its completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Completing both tasks updates the status to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Documentation for Objectives and Tasks

At the bottom of each stage's detailed view, there is a section for documentation. This area allows users to specify objectives and tasks in greater detail, providing more context and information about the specific stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Events Timeline for Overview

The [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] view presents all planned stages, objectives, and associated tasks in a calendar or timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This provides a quick visual overview of deadlines and the overall flow of the business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It shows the deadline date for each stage (e.g., December 3 to December 20) and lists the stage name, associated tasks, and their statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

[[managing_finances_for_freelancers_using_notion | Notion Books Freelancers OS]] is a dashboard designed to help freelancers track their income, expense details, and [[managing_finances_with_notion | entire finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It also includes a dashboard for [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Upon downloading the setup, users land on a page with quick instructions on how to change currency and a tutorial on using the [[managing_finances_using_notion | finance setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The OS has two main navigation windows: "Finance" and "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Finance Section Overview

Before delving into client management, users are advised to understand the [[using_notion_for_financial_management | Finance system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. A video tutorial is provided within the dashboard to explain its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Key financial actions:
*   **Adding Income**: Freelancers can add any income related to a client and classify it as "client" income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Custom classifications can also be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Reflection in Client Portal**: All income transactions classified under "client" will automatically reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Client Section Explained

The client section is where the core of client management resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It's accessible via a navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Core Components
The client section is structured around four main areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
1.  [[invoicing_and_payment_tracking_through_notion | Invoicing details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
2.  Client details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
3.  Project details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
4.  Services section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>

*   **Interlinking**: Projects are linked to specific clients and can have multiple services associated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Workflow
The "Workflow" section at the bottom of the client portal is crucial for linking financial income to client activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. It displays only client-assigned income from the [[managing_finances_with_notion | finance view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Linking**: For each income entry, users can assign an invoice, client, project, and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Filling these fields automatically updates the corresponding sections (e.g., client's invoice amount, project completion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Users can specify the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") once an invoice is paid, which affects [[managing_finances_with_notion | banking calculations]] in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Tools Section

Supporting the main client management features, the OS includes a "Tools" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>:

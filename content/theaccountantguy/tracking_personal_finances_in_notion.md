## Customization and Additional Features

### Tracking Finances for Couples
Couples can use this tracker by splitting account categories under each head (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

This allows for joint financial tracking while maintaining individual accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

### Viewing Specific Account Transactions
To quickly view all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., "Salary" income), click on the account name within the "Finances" summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. A "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom of the right-side panel, which, when clicked, will automatically filter and display only transactions linked to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

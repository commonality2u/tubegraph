This article details how to [[managing_finances_with_Notion | manage personal finances]] using a specific Notion setup, designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial situation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

## Overview of the Notion Tracker

The Notion personal finance tracker features three main sections:
1.  **Net Worth Target**: Allows users to specify a net worth goal for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: Where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Provides an at-a-glance view of all finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This section includes views for finances, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
Additionally, a **Transactions Section** is used to record all income, expenses, asset, and liability transactions that affect the other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | Tracking Income and Expenses in Notion]]

### Setting Up Income and Expense Accounts
To begin [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account section" under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Here, you can find and modify existing income (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expense (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. New accounts can be added by clicking the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

When setting up expenses, you can classify them (e.g., bills, subscriptions) and set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For income and expense accounts, opening balances can typically be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Entering Income and Expense Transactions
After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
The "Transactions" view has five sub-views: "All" (for all transaction types), "Income", "Expenses", "Asset", and "Liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

To add an income transaction:
1.  Navigate to the "Income" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
2.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
3.  Select the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month and listed in descending order by date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
4.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
5.  The category is automatically "Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
6.  Select the relevant income account (e.g., "Salary") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
7.  Choose the payment mode (e.g., bank, cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
8.  Set the transaction type to "Inflow" as money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
9.  Specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

For expenses, the process is similar, but the transaction type should be "Outflow" since money is leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Viewing Income and Expense Summaries
After entering transactions, navigate to the "Summary" view and then "Finances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This view categorizes all accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, showing total amounts and the percentage contribution of each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Changes in transaction figures are automatically updated in this summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments

### Setting Up Debt Accounts (Liabilities)
To track debt, go to the "Account section" under "Get Started" and then to the "Liabilities" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
New debt accounts can be added by clicking "New", providing a name, and specifying an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Classify the account as "Debt" and set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Existing debts can be edited via the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

If you are obtaining a new loan, the transaction type should be "Inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Viewing Debt Summaries
The "Debt" view within the "Summary" section allows tracking of all debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. It offers two main views: "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows payments due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This includes the next payment due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Reflects payments that were due but have not been recorded or missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

This section also displays the total loan amount (opening balance + additional loans) and the total repayment made in percentage and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The look and feel of this view can be customized (e.g., list, gallery, board views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

## [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | Budgeting and Tracking Expenses in Notion]]

To track your budget, enter all income and expense transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Then, go to the "Summary" view and click on "Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This view outlines all incurred expenses and earned income, showing the percentage against your set budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Budget amounts can be adjusted directly within this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. If the budgeted amount property is not visible, it can be enabled by clicking on "31 more properties" and searching for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## [[tracking_savings_transactions_in_notion | Tracking Savings Transactions in Notion]]

### Setting Up Savings Funds (Assets)
To set up savings funds, navigate to the "Account section" under "Get Started" and then to the "Asset" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Savings accounts should be classified under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. When adding a new savings account (e.g., "Car Fund"), specify a goal amount if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. An icon can also be added for visual identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### Entering Savings Transactions
To add savings transactions, go to the "Asset" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
When recording a saving transaction:
1.  Add a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
2.  Provide a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

6.  Enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

This transaction will be reflected in the savings account, showing the amount saved and its percentage towards the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

## Tracking Bills

### Setting Up Bill Accounts (Expenses)
To set up bills, go to the "Account section" under "Get Started" and specify your bills under "Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Bills should be classified as "Bills" and have a payment frequency set (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

### Entering Bill Transactions
Enter bill payment details in the "Expense" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. You will specify the date, description, relevant bill account, payment mode, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The transaction type will be "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

### Viewing Bill Summaries
Once transactions are entered, navigate to the "Bills" part under the "Summary" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Similar to debt tracking, this view has "Upcoming Payment" and "Past Payment" statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Bills due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Bills that were due in the past but haven't been paid within the expected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

This feature helps track missed payments and upcoming obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Tracking Subscriptions

### Setting Up Subscription Accounts (Expenses)
To track subscriptions, go to the "Account section" under "Get Started" and classify expenses that are subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. Set the payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### Entering Subscription Transactions
Add subscription expenses in the "Expenses" view under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Similar to other expenses, you'll select the date, choose the subscription account, payment mode (e.g., bank), set transaction type to "Outflow", and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### Viewing Subscription Summaries
The "Subscription" view under "Summary" tracks payments with "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" sections, identical to bills and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. It reflects the next due date based on the last payment and set frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. This view also shows the subscription status (e.g., active) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

Net worth is calculated as the difference between your assets and liabilities after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

1.  **Set Net Worth Goal**: Navigate to the "Net Worth Goal" section and specify your target net worth for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This value can be changed as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
2.  **View Net Worth Summary**: In the "Net Worth" section under "Summary", you'll see your set goal, current total net worth, the difference (how much you're lagging), and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
3.  **Track Growth**: The "Total Growth" section shows the difference between your closing net worth and opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances specified for assets and liabilities in the "Account section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

## Additional Features and Tips

### Filtering Transactions by Specific Account
To quickly view all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., "Salary" income), click on that account name in the "Finances" summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. A "View Transactions" button will appear, which, when clicked, will automatically filter and display only transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

### Using for Couples
Couples can [[managing_finances_using_Notion | track finances]] by splitting different categories of accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. For example, "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" can be used to denote income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Multi-Currency Support
Notion supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. To change the currency, locate any property with a dollar sign ($) in any view (e.g., "Amount" in "Transactions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Click on it, select "Edit property," go to "Number format," and choose your desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. This needs to be done for all views where currency is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Device Availability
The Notion template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

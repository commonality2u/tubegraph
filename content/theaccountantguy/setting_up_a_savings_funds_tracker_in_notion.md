The Notion savings funds tracker template features a dashboard at the top with two primary views: "Savings Target" and "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is designed to help you set and track your savings goals, providing a clear picture of how much you have saved against your targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Savings Target View

The "Savings Target" view is where you define different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The template includes three default savings funds with preset goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Saving Funds

To modify an existing saving fund:
*   Click the pencil button next to the fund's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   You can rename the saving fund (e.g., changing "Emergency Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   You can also set or change the goal amount directly from here (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Changes made in this view automatically update in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Alternatively, you can click on the fund itself to open a window where you can edit the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Saving Funds

To add a new savings fund:
*   Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   A new entry will appear below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon to name your new fund (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Set your desired goal amount; a default of $1,000 is initially set, which can be changed to any amount, such as $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Deleting Saving Funds

To delete a saving fund:
*   Click the six dots located on the left of the fund's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Savings Overview View

The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of your financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It displays:
*   The total amount you have saved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The total targeted saving amount you have set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The percentage of the targeted amount you have achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Transactions Panel

To add savings to a specific fund, you will use the "Transactions" panel at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Adding New Transactions

To record a new saving transaction:
*   Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will automatically be added with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Transactions are grouped by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   You can set a different date for the transaction using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Enter a description for the saving (e.g., "Saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund this transaction contributes to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Enter the saving amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Impact on Savings Overview

Once a transaction amount is added, it automatically updates the total savings and the percentage achieved in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For example, if a car fund had $1,400 saved and you add another $1,000, the total will reflect $2,400, and the percentage of the $3,000 target will update to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Currency Customization

This savings funds tracker can be used with different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   To change the currency, click on any amount field (which typically displays a dollar currency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Click "Edit property" and then "Number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Notion supports various currencies in this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Assistance is available for [[using_notion_savings_funds_tracker_with_different_currencies | setting up the template in a different currency]] after purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Dynamic Views and Customization

The entire view of your transactions is dynamic and can be displayed based on different timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   By default, transactions are grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   To change this, click the three dots in the transactions panel, then "Group by date," and select "week" or "year" instead of "month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This will dynamically alter the display (e.g., showing savings by year as "2024," "2023") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   The template is fully customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

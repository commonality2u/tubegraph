The [[debt_tracker | Notion Debt Tracker]] template includes a dedicated summary section designed to provide a quick overview of debt repayment progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This section can be found on the primary dashboard of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Summary Section Content

The summary section displays key financial metrics for all debts combined:
*   Total loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
*   Total amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>
*   Total interest repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
*   Repayment in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>

This dashboard summary section is directly linked to the "Total Debt" database, which aggregates values from all individual debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Summary of Debt Database

Beyond the main dashboard's summary section, the [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | Notion Debt Tracker]] also utilizes a "Summary of Debt" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This database calculates specific metrics for *each type* of debt (e.g., student loan, credit card, car loan, personal loan, home loan, and other loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The "Summary of Debt" database includes:
*   Loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   Amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Interest repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   Repayment percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   Debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>

These figures are obtained as roll-up values from the "Debt Overview" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The "Debt Overview" database itself pulls aggregated values from the "Loan Details" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

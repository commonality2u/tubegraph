The [[paycheck_budget_tracker_overview | paycheck budget tracker]] is designed to help users track paycheck payments and manage their budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The tracker is divided into two primary sections: a summary section and an account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Summary Section

Located on the left side of the tracker, the summary section provides a concise overview of financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This section helps users quickly see how much of their [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | budgeted expenses]] has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Account Section

Situated on the right, the account section allows users to categorize and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Expenses can be added under three default categories:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to customize these categories by clicking on them and setting their own preferred heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For each expense, a budgeted amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting budgeted amounts in the account section, users proceed to the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Here, all individual transactions related to each expense are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This data then reflects back in the expense section, providing a comprehensive view of:
*   The total budgeted amount initially set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This functionality supports effective [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget vs actual expense tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker also features quick action buttons to streamline the input process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction:** Automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to input specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source:** Automatically adds a new expense under one of the main expense heads (e.g., fixed expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Users can then reposition this expense source to any desired category using a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

These features enable users to [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | manage their budget]] and ensure they [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | stay on top of their finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

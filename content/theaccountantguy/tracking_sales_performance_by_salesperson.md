The Sales Performance OS template includes a dedicated component and features for [[calculating_total_sales_revenue_using_a_tool | tracking sales performance]] specifically by salesperson. This allows for detailed monitoring of individual contributions to overall sales.

## Salesperson Dashboard Overview

The "Salesperson" component at the top of the sales dashboard provides a comprehensive view of each salesperson's performance. It displays monthly statistics for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

For every salesperson, the following four key statistics are tracked:
*   **Sales Achieved** The total sales made by the salesperson for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sales** The sales goal set for the salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Targeted Sales** The percentage of the set target that has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Target Status** Indicates whether the target was met or not.
    *   If sales exceed targeted sales, the status shows "Target achieved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   If sales are below targeted sales, the status shows "Target not achieved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This monthly breakdown is one of three main tracking dimensions, with salespeople being the individuals responsible for the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Salesperson Overview Panel

On the left side of the dashboard, a "Salesperson overview" panel provides additional insights:
*   **Total Sales** The aggregate sales made by each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Sale Units** The number of units each salesperson has sold over the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Average Sales** The average sale per unit for each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Entering Sales Transaction Data

The Sales Performance OS allows for detailed entry of sales transactions, which feed into the salesperson tracking. The "Sales Transactions" section mirrors the information found in the main sales dashboard, including salesperson details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

When entering a transaction:
*   **Date, Account Details, Sales Details** Basic transaction information can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Month and Year** To categorize the transaction chronologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Detail** Information regarding the salesperson responsible for the sale is fed into the "salesperson window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Client Detail** The client to whom the sale was made can also be recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This client information can be further detailed in a separate dashboard to include address, city, and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Sales Code** A unique code specific to each individual salesperson and transaction (e.g., `jcore_december23` for James Carter's December 2023 sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Sales Target** At the beginning of each month, a sales target can be assigned to each individual salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. A quick action button on the left panel can automatically assign these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Sale Amount and Sales Unit** As sales are made, the actual sales amount and units sold are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Once details are entered in the salesperson window, specific channels and referral codes can be fed in, and other information will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Customization and Management

*   **Editing Salesperson Details** Salesperson names and other details can be instantly edited from a linked dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Individual salesperson entries can also have custom cover images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Adding Months and Years** New months and years can be created to continue [[tracking_purchases_and_consumption | tracking purchases]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Currency Customization** The currency of the entire dashboard can be changed to a preferred choice via the number format property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Filtering Data** Users can filter the sales performance data by a particular year or month, or a combination of both, to see more detailed performance trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This robust system allows for comprehensive [[client_purchase_summary_and_kpi_tracking | KPI tracking]] and detailed insights into individual salesperson performance.

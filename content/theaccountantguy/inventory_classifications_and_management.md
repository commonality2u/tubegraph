This article outlines how a dedicated template can be utilized to [[inventory_tracking_for_small_businesses | track inventory for a small business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, covering inventory setup, portfolio management, status tracking, and transaction logging.

## Inventory Portfolio Overview

The template provides an inventory portfolio with three primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   Inventory Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Inventory Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Inventory Setup

The Inventory Setup section allows for [[setting_up_inventory_categories_and_subcategories | classification of inventory]] into three main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>:
*   Raw Materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Work in Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Finished Goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

For each added inventory item, specific details are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units**: The initial count of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle**: Options include FIFO, LIFO, and WSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This can be left as default if not understood, as it won't affect reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level**: This is the threshold of units at which reordering of the inventory is triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, a reorder level of 60 units for wheat and 10 units for corn was set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Adding New Inventory
New inventory can be added by clicking the "Add Inventory" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. New entries initially appear in a "No Classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> and can then be moved to the desired category (e.g., Work in Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Once moved, values can be entered using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Tracking Current Inventory

The Inventory Portfolio section provides key current data for each inventory item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   **Inventory Value**: The value of the inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available**: The total units available after all purchases and sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **[[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | Reorder Status]]**: This indicates whether the inventory level has dropped below its set reorder level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For instance, if wheat drops below 60 units, a "low stock" message appears, prompting a reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If corn has 70 units available and its reorder level is 10 units, it will show as "available in surplus," indicating no reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This feature allows for a quick overview of inventory sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Inventory Status

The Inventory Status view provides insights into the current location or stage of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Statuses include:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
Users can edit or add new statuses as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

For example, if "In Transit" shows "1," it means one inventory item from purchases or sales is currently in transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. A corn purchase of 50 units for 500 made on August 26th could be marked as in transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Similarly, "Not Sent" indicating "1" could point to a sales item currently in the "not sent" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This feature enables quick [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | tracking of inventory status]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Transaction Management

The transaction section allows for [[tracking_inventory_transactions | tracking purchases and sales]], and calculating profit and loss for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases
Purchase entries are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
Details for each purchase include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
*   **Date**: Transactions are automatically grouped into different months based on the date selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Description**: A field to add details about the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Account**: Allows selecting the specific inventory item (e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Number of Units**: The quantity of units purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Purchase Price**: The cost of the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status**: Assigns a status to the particular purchase transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, which can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
A "Buy Inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Sales
Similar to purchases, a sales section allows for tracking sales of inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit and Loss
For each sale, the profit or loss is calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This requires inputting the purchase price (cost of goods sold) for the particular sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, if bread was sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, inputting $10 will automatically calculate the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This helps in understanding the profitability of each inventory item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This comprehensive approach to inventory management helps users to track inventory, assign statuses, and know its current location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

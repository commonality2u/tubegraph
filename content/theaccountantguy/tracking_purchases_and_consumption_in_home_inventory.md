This article provides a walkthrough of a simple [[using_notion_for_home_inventory_tracking | home inventory tracker]] template designed to help users keep track of all their home inventory in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This [[features_of_a_home_inventory_tracker_template | template]] allows for the monitoring of purchases, consumption, and availability of items, providing a comprehensive overview of home inventory.

## Overview of Purchases

The left side of the [[features_of_a_home_inventory_tracker_template | template]] provides a financial summary related to inventory purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It displays:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total actual purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

## Inventory Categorization

The right side of the [[features_of_a_home_inventory_tracker_template | template]] is divided into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>:

### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up different categories for their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples provided include Dairy and Eggs, Medicines, and Fruits and Veggies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Under each main category, users can list subcategories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and specify an estimated budgeted purchase amount for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Inventory Overview
This section provides a summary of inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, showing:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   The percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
This overview is applicable to all listed subcategories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Transaction Section
The transaction section is where users record inventory transactions, encompassing both purchases and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. When recording a purchase, such as cheese, users specify the purchased inventory item and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For consumption, users can add an entry, specify the item (e.g., cheese), and indicate the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Automatic Updates and Tracking

Once transaction entries are made, the [[features_of_a_home_inventory_tracker_template | template]] automatically updates all relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This automation allows users to continuously track available inventory and monitor consumption needs for each item in their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The [[features_of_a_home_inventory_tracker_template | template]] is entirely customizable to meet specific user requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

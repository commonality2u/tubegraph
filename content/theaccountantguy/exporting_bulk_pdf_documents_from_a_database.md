PDFoutput.com offers a solution for [[generating_pdf_documents_for_business_purposes | generating PDF documents for business purposes]], including the ability to [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | generate PDF documents in bulk]] from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This feature allows users to [[bulk_exporting_and_downloading_generated_pdf_files | export multiple PDF documents]] efficiently without needing to fill details one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Accessing Bulk Export Mode

To begin [[bulk_pdf_document_export_process | bulk exporting and managing PDF documents for business]], navigate to PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Once on the site, locate and click the "bulk export mode" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Filling the Database

In the bulk export mode, you will find a database interface where you can input multiple entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This database includes fields such as invoice number and invoice date, mirroring the fields available in the single PDF generation mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Columns within this database can be expanded for better visibility to ensure all necessary details are properly entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Generating Bulk PDFs

Once all the required information has been filled into the database rows, the [[bulk_pdf_document_export_process | bulk export process]] can be initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

*   **Download All PDFs**: To [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents | export all documents in bulk]], click on "download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The system will then generate PDF documents one by one, based on the information provided in each row of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Individual Row Export**: It is also possible to [[exporting_completed_pdf_invoices | export a PDF document for a particular row]] by clicking the "download PDF" option associated with that specific entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

## Output and Customization

The generated PDF documents will precisely match the format of those created in the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The selected currency will be reflected in the output PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Users can change the currency setting, and subsequent downloads will populate the invoice with the newly chosen currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## Future Developments

The platform currently supports a live database feature for input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Future plans include adding a Notion database feature, which will allow users to add details to their Notion database and then export documents directly from PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. More templates will also be added in the future, and users can send requests for specific templates or provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

The savings funds dashboard in [[managing_finances_with_notion | Notion]] features a "Savings Target" view, which is used to define different savings funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This dashboard also includes a "Savings Overview" that provides a summary of total savings achieved against set targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Targets
The "Savings Target" section comes with three default savings funds and their associated goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

To edit an existing saving fund:
1.  Click the pencil icon next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., from "Savings Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set a new goal amount by clicking on the current amount and entering a new value (e.g., changing $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Any changes made to the saving fund's name or goal amount will automatically update in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Alternatively, you can click directly on the savings fund entry itself to open a detailed view, where you can edit the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Targets
To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This will create a new entry below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon for the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Give the new fund a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Set the desired goal amount (e.g., $10,000), replacing the default $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Targets
To delete a savings fund:
1.  Click the six dots located on the left side of the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Currency Settings
The [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To change the currency:
1.  Click on any amount with a dollar currency symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

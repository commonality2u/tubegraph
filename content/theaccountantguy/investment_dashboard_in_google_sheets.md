An Investment Dashboard is a feature within a [[using_google_sheets_for_personal_finance | personal finance tracker]] developed in a Google Sheet that allows users to track their investments. It is designed to reflect all held investments along with necessary calculations such as portfolio value and gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Key Features and Functionality

The investment dashboard is completely dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, requiring minimal user input for comprehensive tracking.

### User Input and Automatic Updates
Users only need to enter the following information:
*   The symbol of the investment (e.g., Apple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   The number of shares purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   The purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Upon entering this data, everything else updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The price and related graphs update in real-time as trading occurs in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, eliminating the need for manual entries or changes for price updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Information Displayed
The dashboard provides a quick representation of various financial metrics related to investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, including:
*   Market value of the symbols held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Analysis of cost versus market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Growth of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Symbol representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Total portfolio value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   Portfolio gain (in absolute amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   Portfolio gain in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Dividend (presumably dividend rate or yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Total holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

All these parameters update in real-time as trading occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, allowing users to view their entire investments at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

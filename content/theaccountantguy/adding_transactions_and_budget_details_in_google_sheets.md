This personal finance tracker spreadsheet helps users [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_google_sheets | track income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The spreadsheet generally contains three main tabs:
*   Dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

A "Start Here" tab provides necessary instructions for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Budget Tab Setup

To begin [[setting_up_a_monthly_budget_in_google_sheets | setting up a monthly budget in Google Sheets]], the first step is to navigate to the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here, users need to input details related to their income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

For each account, specify:
*   Whether it is an income or expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The budgeted amount for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The "Goal Amount" column automatically totals the monthly amounts, as it is a formula-driven column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. When adding new line items, this formula needs to be dragged down to copy it to the new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users can add new rows by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Transactions Tab Setup

After specifying accounts and budget estimations in the Budget tab, the next step is to add individual transactions in the Transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This section is crucial for [[utilizing_transaction_section_for_budget_management | budget management]].

For each transaction, input the following details:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   **Details** of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **Category** related to the transaction, which links to the accounts previously added in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   **Amount** of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

Column E, which indicates whether an item is an income or expense, is formula-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When adding new transactions, this formula also needs to be dragged down to new line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Once details are added to the Transactions tab, users can then navigate to the Dashboard section to view analyses of their income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

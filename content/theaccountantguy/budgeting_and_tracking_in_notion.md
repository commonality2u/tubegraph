Anath Biswal, "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to use a Notion-based travel expense tracker to monitor travel expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This template helps users keep track of finances by categorizing spending, setting budgets, and visualizing financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This can be considered a specific application of [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Using Notion for budgeting]] and [[expense_tracking_in_notion | Expense Tracking in Notion]].

## Template Overview

The travel expense tracker is divided into three main sections:
*   **Accounts**: Where different expense sources and their budgeted amounts are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Displays total incurred expenses, budgeted expenses, and the percentage spent for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This ties into [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses in Notion]].
*   **Overall Summary**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This aspect helps with [[setting_and_tracking_budget_goals_with_notion | setting and tracking budget goals with Notion]].

## Setting Up Accounts and Budgeting

The "Accounts" view allows for the classification and budgeting of various expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Expense Sources
*   To add a new expense source, click "add expense source" to automatically add it to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon to edit the details, such as changing the name (e.g., to "Metro") and setting a budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Expense sources can be moved between categories by clicking the three dots next to them (e.g., moving an expense source to "Meals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Customizing Categories
*   To add a completely new expense category or group, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Existing groups (like Travel, Meals, Lodging) can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Each expense source has a budgeted amount set, which is crucial for [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | setting budgets and recording transactions in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Monitoring Expenses

The "Expenses" section provides a detailed view of spending against budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   It displays the total expense incurred, the budgeted expense, and the percentage of the budgeted expense spent for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Color-coding**:
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are highlighted in red (e.g., a $2,000 flight expense against a $1,000 budget shows 200% spent in red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Expenses within the budgeted amount are shown in green (e.g., $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget shows 33% in green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   This visual classification provides a quick overview of spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The "Summary" section gives a high-level view of overall financial health for the trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

*   It shows the total budgeted expense, total incurred expense, and the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   A percentage reflects total expenses divided by budgeted expenses (e.g., $3,600 incurred divided by $6,068 budgeted equals 59%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This feature is key for [[using_notion_for_budgeting_and_savings | using Notion for budgeting and savings]].

## Booking Expenses

The expense tracker simplifies recording transactions. Expenses are categorized under Travel, Meals, and Lodging, mirroring the account setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Quick Addition Buttons**: Buttons like "Add travel expense" allow for rapid entry of new expenses with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Expense Details**: For each expense, users can add:
    *   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
    *   **Trip Info**: A general label for the trip (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Account**: The specific expense source (e.g., Train for travel expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: The cost of the expense (e.g., $100 for a train ride) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Adding an expense automatically updates the "Expenses" and "Summary" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. For example, if a $100 train expense is added, and the train account has a $200 budget, the "Expenses" view will show 50% spent in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

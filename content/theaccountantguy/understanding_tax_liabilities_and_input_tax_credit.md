This guide explains how to use a template to [[tracking_tax_payments_using_notion | track]] all tax payments, specifically focusing on tax liabilities and [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input tax credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes a [[managing_quarterly_tax_payments | quarterly tax payment]] section to monitor all tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary displays three key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes.

### Accounts

The "Accounts" section is where you set up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These allow for availing [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input tax credit]] to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The template initially includes two revenue sources (services and goods) and one expense source (purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. You can add more revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. An "Add Revenue Source" button automatically adds a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and an "Add Expense Source" button adds an expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Details can be fed in using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The summary updates automatically to reflect the number of revenue and expense sources added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Financials

The "Financials" section allows you to [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | track]] your total revenue amount, expense amount, along with the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, if services generated $2,000 in revenue, it might have a total tax payable of $200 (at a 10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. All details entered in the [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transactions]] view at the bottom of the template automatically update the figures in the financial summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Similarly, purchases might have an [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input tax]] of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

Moving to the "[[managing_quarterly_tax_payments | Quarterly Taxes]]" section, it reflects all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:05]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | Input tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

For instance, if [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transactions]] are booked for Quarter 3, the figures for taxes payable, [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input tax]], and tax liability will be updated in Quarter 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Transaction Tracking

After setting up revenue and expense account sources, you can scroll down to the [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transaction]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:40]</a>. [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | Transactions]] are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Revenue Transactions

To add a revenue [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transaction]], click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This automatically adds a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You can then select:
*   **Period**: Choose the relevant quarter (e.g., September falls in Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the revenue account (e.g., "Goods") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Input the revenue amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate**: Specify the applicable tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:20]</a>.

Once the tax rate is entered, the tax payable amount (e.g., $80) is automatically calculated and displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:24]</a>. This updates the total taxes payable in the [[managing_quarterly_tax_payments | quarterly taxes]] summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:33]</a>. For example, a total of $280 payable might lead to a tax liability of $270 after deducting an initial $10 [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Expense Transactions

Adding an expense [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transaction]] follows a similar process by clicking "Add Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:48]</a>. The system automatically adds a new expense line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:51]</a>. Details to fill in include:
*   **Period**: Quarter (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Account**: Expense account (e.g., "Purchases") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Expense amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate**: Applicable tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:06]</a>.

This calculates the [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input credit]] (e.g., $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:08]</a>. The total [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | input credit]] (e.g., $60 if combined with a previous $10) will be reflected in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:12]</a>. The tax liability will also update automatically (e.g., to $220) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Profit and Loss

The template also includes a [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | profit and loss]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, which displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Total expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:43]</a>.

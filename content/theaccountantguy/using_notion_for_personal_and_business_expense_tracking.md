A Notion expenses tracker can help users manage all their expenses in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template is designed to track expenses for both personal and business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Key Features

### Category Management
The tracker features a category section at the top, which allows for defining, editing, and managing different expense types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

*   **Customization**: Each category can be defined according to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Renaming Categories**: Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon, which allows users to rename the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Editing/Deleting Categories**: Clicking on the three dots next to a category provides options to edit or delete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking the "new page" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Expense Tracking
Beneath the categories, expenses are listed and linked to their respective categories.

*   **Budgeted vs. Actual**: For every category, there is a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Updates**: As amounts are entered into the expense list, the corresponding categories automatically update with the respective expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides an overview of financial performance against the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

*   **Key Metrics**: It displays the budgeted expense amount, actual expenses amount, the difference between the two, and the percentage of the budget that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Automatic Calculation**: The actual expenses are computed from the expense table below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Key Features of the Notion Expense Tracker

### Category Management
The tracker includes a category section at the top, initially featuring three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These categories are user-definable, allowing for personalization based on specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Renaming Categories**: Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon, which, when clicked, allows the user to rename the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Editing/Deleting Categories**: Categories can be edited or deleted by clicking on the three dots next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by simply clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Expense Tracking Details
Each category in the tracker is associated with two key financial figures:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Actual Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

When expense amounts are entered, the corresponding categories update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides an overview of financial performance:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount**: Displays the total amount budgeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount**: Computes the actual expenses from the detailed expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Difference**: Shows the variance between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Spent**: Indicates the proportion of the budget that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Setting Budgets
Users can set their own budgeted expense amounts by clicking on the budgeted expense figure within the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Changes made here are reflected in the overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

A key feature of the [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker_in_Notion | customer payments tracker]] is its summary section, designed to provide a quick overview of financial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This section is located on the left side of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Components of the Summary Section

The summary section displays four key metrics to help users track payment totals at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   **Total Amount Due** The aggregate sum of all payments expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Payment Amount Received** The total amount of money that has been collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Difference** The variance between the total amount due and the payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Total Payments Received** This metric shows the proportion of the total due amount that has been collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Data Flow and Updates

While the summary section provides the top-level view, its figures are derived from other sections of the tracker. Specifically, the payment data shown in the [[summary_and_account_sections | overview section]]—which includes total payment received, payment amount due, and percentage received—originates from the [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

When details like transaction dates, descriptions, customer names, and payment amounts are entered into the transaction section, the payment received amount automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This ensures that the summary section, along with the overview, always reflects the most current financial status based on recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

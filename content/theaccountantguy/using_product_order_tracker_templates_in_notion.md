A product order tracker template in [[using_notion_for_business_tracking|Notion]] provides a simple way to keep track of all products customers are ordering for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template is fully customizable to meet specific business needs and can incorporate additional key performance indicators (KPIs) like average order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Database Structure

The core of the product order tracker is a database that captures essential information about each order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Key fields include:

*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Order Details**
    *   Payment sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Indication if the product is a gift item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
    *   Amount for the particular order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

The database can be expanded to include more items and details as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Order Summary and Analytics

At the top of the tracker, an order summary provides key metrics and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Total Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers** who placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Gift Recommendation Percentage**: Indicates the percentage of customers looking to place products as gift items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This percentage changes dynamically as values are updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Payment Source Breakdown

A dedicated section for payment sources specifies how many customers are paying through different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This breakdown includes:

*   Debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Each payment source reflects the number of customers using it and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The paycheck budget tracker is a tool designed to help users track their [[payments_tracker | paycheck payments]] and manage their budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a>. It allows individuals to monitor their finances, ensuring they stay on top of their budgeted [[payments_tracker | payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>.

## Tracker Sections

The tracker is divided into two primary sections:

### Summary Section
Located on the left side of the interface, the summary section provides a high-level [[budget_summary_and_tracking | overview of budgeting tracker template]] of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>.
*   Total expenses that have been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"></a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>.

### Account Section
Found on the right side, the account section enables users to add and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>. Expenses can be categorized under three default heads:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>

Users have the flexibility to customize these category heads if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>. After adding accounts, users can set a specific budgeted amount for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>.

## Transaction Management

The transaction section is where all individual transactions related to each expense are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52"></a>. Once transactions are added, they are reflected in the expense section, providing updates on:
*   The total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>.
*   The expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03"></a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

For ease of use, the tracker includes quick action buttons:
*   **Add Transaction:** Clicking this button automatically adds a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to input details directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>.
*   **Add Expense Source:** This button automatically adds a new expense category under one of the main heads, such as "Fixed Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28"></a>. Users can then reposition this new expense source under any desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40"></a>.

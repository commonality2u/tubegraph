A Notion expenses tracker allows users to effectively manage and [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | track expenses against a budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template is designed to keep all expense management under one unified system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and can be customized for any personal or business use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Overview of Budget and Actual Expenses

The tracker provides a clear distinction between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For each expense category, there is a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. When expenses are entered into the tracker, the actual expense amounts for the respective categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This allows for continuous [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | tracking budgeted vs actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | Setting and Adjusting Budgeted Amounts]]

Users can easily [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | set their own budgeted expense amounts]] for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. By clicking on the "budget expense amount" field within a category, the budgeted figure can be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Changes to these budgeted figures automatically update the total budget in the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Summary of Expense Differences and Percentages

The summary section of the tracker is crucial for [[budget_versus_actual_expense_tracking | budget versus actual expense tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It provides a comprehensive [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expenses summary]] and allows for quick analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The summary displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses amount, which is computed dynamically from the expense entries in the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

![[calculating_percentages_and_formatting_data | Calculating percentages and formatting data]] is automated, ensuring that all figures in the summary are updated as expenses are recorded and budgeted amounts are adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This provides a clear [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of expenses and budget tracking]] and facilitates efficient [[analyzing_expenses_by_type_and_period | analyzing expenses by type and period]] against set budgets.

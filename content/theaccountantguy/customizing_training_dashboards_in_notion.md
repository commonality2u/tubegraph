The Employee Training Expenses Tracker in Notion provides a customizable dashboard for managing training programs and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This dashboard is designed to be fully editable and [[customizing_and_using_notion_templates | customizable]] based on various parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The training dashboard presents two primary views:
*   **Training Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
*   **Employee Records** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

### Training Overview
This section provides a summary of all scheduled trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each individual training, the following details are displayed:
*   **Training Date**: When employees are scheduled to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Employees Count**: The number of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Employee Records
This section lists employees organized by their departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Department Management**:
    *   Departments can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   New departments can be added by sliding a control to the right and clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Employees can be moved between departments by dragging and dropping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, or by clicking a three-dot menu next to an employee and moving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Individual Employee Details**:
    *   **Total Trainings Attended**: Reflects the number of trainings an employee has attended out of those they were supposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Percentage of Attendance**: Shows the attendance rate for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   **Next Training Date**: Users can specify the next training date, and the dashboard automatically calculates the remaining days until that date from the current day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

Located on the left side of the dashboard, this section provides a consolidated financial summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
*   **Total Expense**: The sum of all expenses incurred for all trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Number of Trainings**: The total count of all conducted trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Employee Count**: The number of employees whose records are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Average Expense**: The average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

All these metrics update automatically as transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Detailed Management Sections

Below the main dashboard, three detailed views allow for granular data management:

### Employee Details
This section mirrors the employee records, allowing users to add, edit, and categorize employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Adding Employees**: Click "add employee" to add a new record, which initially appears under "no department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. New employees can then be moved to any department using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Editing Employee Details**: Click the edit button to type and update employee names and records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is recommended to use the quick action button on the left for adding employees rather than editing the database directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Training Records
This view lists all training sessions and allows for their management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   **Setting Training Details**: For each training, users can set the date and feed in training specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Assigning Employees**: Employees can be selected for a training by clicking on the relevant field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Multiple employees can be tagged to a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Tracking Attendance**: A checkbox indicates if assigned employees have attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The percentage of attendance for a training automatically updates based on these selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Adding Training Records**: Use the "add training" quick action button for new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Training Expenses
This section allows users to view and edit the expenses for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Editing Expenses**: Click the pencil icon next to an expense to modify the amount, which automatically updates the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **View Options**: The default view can be changed to a table view for quick editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## General Customization

The dashboard is designed for extensive [[customizing_and_using_notion_templates | customization]] to suit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **[[customizing_dashboard_views_and_currency_settings_in_notion | Currency Settings]]**:
    *   To change the currency format in specific fields (e.g., expense fields), click on the field, then "edit property," and select the desired currency from the number format options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   To change the currency displayed in the dashboard's top calculations (e.g., total expense), click on the information, as the dollar sign is embedded within the formula, allowing for direct editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

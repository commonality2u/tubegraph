After successfully [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents | generating PDF documents]] using a Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, the generated PDFs can be previewed and downloaded. The process involves connecting a database (e.g., "boarding pass database") to a template (e.g., "boarding pass template") via [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF output]] connection details, loading information, and then exporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Previewing Generated PDFs

Once the export process is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, a sample of the generated PDF can be previewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. The preview confirms that the document, such as a boarding pass, has been generated with all the details present in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

## Downloading and Accessing Files

After previewing, the generated files can be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. Once the files are downloaded, they can be opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. The demonstration showcased opening multiple generated PDF files, each with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. This illustrates how [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF output]] can be used to generate PDF documents from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.

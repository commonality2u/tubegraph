The Notion Formula Chatbot is a tool designed for [[notion_application | Notion users]] who find it challenging to obtain the correct [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] for their specific use cases within [[notion_application | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This chatbot assists in deriving the exact [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] required for [[using_formulas_in_notion | using formulas]] in [[notion_application | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin interacting with the [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]], users need to place their OpenAI API key and select a [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | GPT model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### OpenAI API Key

An OpenAI API key is essential for the chatbot to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Generating a Key**: Users can click the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find a link that redirects them to the OpenAI platform for API key generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   On the OpenAI platform, navigate to "API Keys" on the left, then click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Users can name the key (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Important**: Copy the generated key immediately, as it cannot be viewed again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Placement**: Paste the copied key into the designated area in the chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A confirmation message "AP key has been entered" will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Free Credit**: New OpenAI accounts typically receive a $5 free credit, which can be used for testing with the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### GPT Model Selection

After entering the API key, users can select their preferred [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | GPT model]] from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: This is an older model, less accurate but suitable for free accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The entire demonstration of the chatbot's capabilities in the video was performed using this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4.106 Preview**: This is a newer, more accurate model, recommended for users with a paid OpenAI plan to achieve better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Using the Chatbot

The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections: Info, Chat, and Give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Chat Section Interaction

The "Chat" section is where users interact with the bot to ask [[notion_application | Notion]]-related questions, specifically concerning [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The chatbot provides instant responses and explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Examples of Questions for Notion Formulas

The chatbot can handle various [[examples_of_questions_for_notion_formulas | Notion formula questions]], from simple to complex:
*   **Adding Two Numbers**: When asked "What is the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] to add two numbers in Notion?", the chatbot suggests `property A + property B`, where 'property A' and 'property B' represent the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Time Difference Between Dates**: For finding the difference between a birth date and today's date in years, the chatbot recommends the `dateBetween` [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] with 'years' as the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **If Condition**: For a more complex query like "If number one is greater than number two, generate number one as the output; otherwise, generate number two," the chatbot correctly provides an `if` condition [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] using `number one` and `number two` properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE]

A template has been developed by Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," to help small businesses track their inventory using [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This template provides a comprehensive system for managing inventory, tracking transactions, and monitoring profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio Overview

The template features an "Inventory Portfolio" section at the top, which offers three distinct views to manage and monitor inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Inventory Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Inventory Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Inventory Setup

The "Inventory Setup" section allows for the classification and detailed setup of inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Inventory Classifications
Inventory can be classified into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   **Raw Materials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Work in Progress (WIP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Finished Goods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

### Inventory Item Details
For each inventory item added, the following details can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting financial balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units**: The initial quantity of units at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Principle**: Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WSC (Weighted Average Cost). Users who do not understand these principles can leave them as is, as it will not affect other reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level**: A threshold indicating the number of units at which reordering is required. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Adding New Inventory Items
To add a new inventory item, simply click the "Add Inventory" button. This will place a new entry in a "no classification" window. Users can then drag and drop the item to assign it to a specific category (e.g., "Work in Progress") and then click a pencil icon to input its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio

This section provides an overview of the inventory's current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   **Inventory Value**: The value of the inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available**: The total number of units remaining after all purchases and sales transactions have been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level**: This status indicates whether an item needs to be reordered based on its reorder level.
    *   If units drop below the set reorder level (e.g., wheat at 30 units when the reorder level is 60), a "low stock" message appears, indicating the need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   If units are significantly above the reorder level (e.g., corn at 70 units when the reorder level is 10), a "surplus" message appears, indicating no immediate reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Inventory Status

The "Inventory Status" view tracks the current physical status of inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Status Categories**: Default categories include "In Transit," "In Progress," and "Not Sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Users can edit existing statuses or add new ones to fit their specific workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Tracking**: The status view shows how many inventory items are in each state (e.g., one item in "In Transit," indicating a purchase like 50 units of corn bought for $500 on August 26th is currently in transit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Sales can also be tracked, such as a "not sent" status for a sales transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Transaction Section

At the bottom of the template, the "Transaction Section" manages purchases, sales, and profit and loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases
*   **Date Bifurcation**: Transactions are automatically grouped and displayed by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Dates can also indicate if a transaction was made "in the last 30 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Transaction Details**: Users can add a description, select the specific inventory account (e.g., wheat, corn, bread), input the number of units, and specify the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The total purchase amount is automatically populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status for Transactions**: The status (e.g., "In Transit") can be assigned to each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button**: A "Buy Inventory" button is available to quickly add a new purchase transaction with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Sales
Similar to purchases, the sales section allows users to record and track all inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit and Loss
This section calculates the profit or loss for each sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: Users input the sale price and the corresponding purchase or manufacturing cost of the item. The template then automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Example**: If bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, the profit is $30 per unit. For 30 units sold, this results in a $900 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

This comprehensive [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Notion]] template helps businesses track inventory, monitor stock levels, manage transactions, and understand profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The savings funds tracker in Notion offers dynamic options for [[currency_customization_in_notion_dashboards | customizing]] currency display and data view formats to suit user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Adjusting Currency Display

The savings fund tracker can be used with various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To change the currency display:
*   Click on any amount field that currently displays a dollar currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   A "number format" option will appear, listing all the different currencies Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Assistance is available for [[customizing_notion_finance_templates | setting up this template]] in a different currency after purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Modifying Date Grouping and View Formats

The transaction panel's view is initially grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. To change this grouping:
*   Click on the three dots icon within the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   Confirm that the grouping is set by date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Within the date grouping options, you can choose to group by week, month, or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   The view will dynamically change to reflect the chosen time period, such as showing transactions grouped by year (e.g., 2024, 2023) or week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

This feature allows for [[customizing_data_presentation_in_notion | dynamic data presentation]] that can be altered to fit specific viewing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

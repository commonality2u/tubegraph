This article, demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," explains how to set up recurring bill payment reminders directly on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These reminders can appear similar to messages detailing bill type, due date, and payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

1.  Click the dropdown menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat (e.g., "every month") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day for the notification to be received (e.g., 11:55 on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once set, the notification will be sent to your [[receiving_whatsapp_notifications_for_bill_payments | WhatsApp]] at the specified time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Utilizing Automation with Pabbly Connect

This process requires the assistance of an [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation]] tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation]] setup within Pabbly Connect is included with the template download, along with a detailed explanation and guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Once this [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation]] is configured, you will automatically [[receiving_whatsapp_notifications_for_bill_payments | receive notifications on your WhatsApp]] for every bill set on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Real-Time Demonstration of Recurring Notifications

When a recurring bill notification is due, a new bill item is automatically added to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For instance, if a "Mobile bill" is set for 11:55 AM on the 20th of September, it will appear as a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Subsequently, a notification will be sent to [[receiving_whatsapp_notifications_for_bill_payments | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The system typically sends the notification within about a minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This ensures that for every recurring bill added through this template, you will consistently [[receiving_whatsapp_notifications_for_bill_payments | receive notifications on WhatsApp]] every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

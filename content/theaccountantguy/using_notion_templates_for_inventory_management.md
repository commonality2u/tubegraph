The [[using_notion_for_finance_management | Notion]] [[notion_inventory_template_setup | template]] for home inventory management, also known as the [[home_inventory_tracking_with_notion | Home Inventory tracker]], is designed to help users keep track of all their home inventory in one centralized place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Key Features

This [[notion_inventory_template_setup | template]] is structured into several sections to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed tracking capabilities:

#### Overview Dashboard
On the left side of the dashboard, users can find key financial metrics related to their inventory:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total purchases already made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

#### Inventory Categories
The right side of the dashboard features three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The "Inventory Categories" section allows users to set up different categories for their inventory, such as "Darian eggs," "medicines," and "fruits and veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Each category can list subcategories along with their estimated budgeted purchase amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

#### Inventory Overview
The "Inventory Overview" section provides a summary of all items, stating:
*   Total purchases made for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   The percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
This overview is applicable to all listed subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

#### Transaction Section
The "Transaction Section" allows users to record inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, a "cheese purchase" can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Users can specify the purchased inventory items and the amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. When an item is consumed, a new entry can be added to specify the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the different subsections, allowing users to track available inventory and consumption requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

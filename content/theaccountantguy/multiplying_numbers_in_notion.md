It is possible to calculate the product of two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This can be achieved using two different [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup

To calculate products, a database should consist of:
*   A "name of the operator" property (title property) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two input numbers, each assigned a [[properties_of_numbers_in_notion | number property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Formula properties to display the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Calculation Methods

The product of two numbers can be calculated using two distinct methods:

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

This method uses the specific `multiply` operator formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   It takes two numbers as input to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   For example, providing `2` and `3` as inputs results in a product of `6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol

Alternatively, you can simply use the multiply symbol (`*`) placed between the two numbers in a [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This method directly multiplies the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

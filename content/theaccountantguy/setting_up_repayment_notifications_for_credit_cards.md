A credit card expenses tracker can be utilized to keep track of credit card payments and receive notifications about upcoming repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system includes a dedicated notification section designed to help users pay their credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Notification Section Overview

The notification section displays critical information regarding upcoming credit card repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For each credit card added to the tracker, it indicates:
*   When the next repayment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   How many days are remaining until the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This feature allows users to track all their credit card payments and ascertain upcoming due dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, ultimately helping to pay credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Setting Repayment Dates

Users can set their own repayment dates within the notification section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This is done by clicking on the designated area and entering a date of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. As users progress with their credit cards, they can continuously adjust these repayment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Once a repayment date is set, the system will automatically display the number of days pending until that repayment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

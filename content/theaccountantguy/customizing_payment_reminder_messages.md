Debt payment reminders can be set up to send notifications via WhatsApp on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These reminders provide a convenient way to manage recurring debt obligations, such as car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Example of a Debt Payment Reminder Message

A typical reminder message includes:
*   A clear "Debt Payment Reminder Alert" header <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The specific loan type (e.g., car loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The due date for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   The total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   An integrated payment link (e.g., PayPal link) that redirects to a bank portal or payment platform for instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This link can be customized to any desired payment portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

These messages are fully customizable for various purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, allowing users to [[customizing_reminder_alerts_in_whatsapp | customize reminder alerts in WhatsApp]] as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Payment Reminders

To receive [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]], the primary step is to create a template for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This process involves [[using_templates_for_loan_reminders | using templates for loan reminders]] and configuring their settings.

### Creating a New Template
1.  Access the template creation option from a drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Input loan details such as the loan type (e.g., car loan) and the repayment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Setting Up Repetition
Templates can be set to repeat automatically, populating all specified values for a defined period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring bill payment reminders]], repetition can be set on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For example, a car loan template can be configured to repeat every month on a specific day (e.g., the 16th) at a chosen time and in a specific time zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This ensures that the loan information is automatically added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Adjusting Notification Timing
The notification date can be adjusted relative to the actual loan due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Early Notification**: To receive a notification a certain number of days (e.g., 7 days) before the due date, enter the number of days into the template settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This means a reminder for a September 23rd due date could be received on September 16th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **On Due Date Notification**: To receive the notification on the same day as the set repayment date, set the adjustment to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Automation and Notifications
Once a recurring template is set up, it automatically triggers an automation that sends the payment notification message to WhatsApp each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This automation can handle any number of loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. For instance, if an "education loan" template is set to appear at a specific time, a new loan entry will automatically populate the database, and a payment alert will be triggered on WhatsApp shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Managing Reminder Templates
Users can [[managing_and_deleting_payment_reminder_templates | manage and delete payment reminder templates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Once a loan has been repaid, the associated template can be deleted to prevent further recurring notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

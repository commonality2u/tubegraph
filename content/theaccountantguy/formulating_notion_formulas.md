For Notion users who find it challenging to create formulas for specific use cases, the [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] offers assistance in deriving the exact formulas required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Getting Started with the Chatbot

Before interacting with the [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | chatbot]], you must provide an OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Once the API key is placed, you need to select your preferred GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Generating an OpenAI API Key
1.  Click on the question mark icon within the [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | chatbot]] interface to find a link for generating an OpenAI key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  This link redirects to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
3.  Navigate to "Open API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
5.  Fill in the details (e.g., a "test key" name) and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
6.  **Crucially, copy the generated key immediately**, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
7.  Paste this copied key into the designated field in the [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A confirmation message will appear indicating the API key has been entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

*New OpenAI accounts receive a $5 free credit, usable for testing with the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.*

### Selecting a GPT Model
The [[using_notion_formula_chatbot | chatbot]] offers two models via a dropdown menu:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo:** An older model, less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Suitable for free accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **GPT 4-106 Preview:** Provides better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Recommended for paid OpenAI plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*The demonstrations in the video were performed using GPT 3.5 Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.*

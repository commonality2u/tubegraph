This article provides a guide on [[using_notion_for_expense_tracking | tracking personal finances]] using a Notion-based system, covering income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. The system is designed to give a comprehensive overview of financial health at a glance, allowing users to [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | track transactions and expenses]] for various categories. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

The Notion tracker is structured with several key sections:
*   **Net Worth Target** Users can set a financial year net worth target. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Account Section** This is where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified, including opening balances, payment frequencies, and categories. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Summary Section** Provides an immediate overview of all finances. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Debt Section** Lists upcoming and past debt payments, showing due dates, total debt, and amounts paid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Budget Section** Allows for setting estimated income and expenses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   **Savings Section** Helps users [[tracking_savings_and_contributions_with_notion | track savings and contributions]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   **Bill Section** Displays upcoming and past bill payments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **Subscription Section** Similar to the debt and bills sections, it tracks [[tracking_subscription_expenses_in_notion | subscription expenses in Notion]], their status (active), and payment dates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Net Worth Section** Offers a total overview of net worth achieved and how much remains to reach the target. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   **Transaction Section** This is the core area for feeding all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions, which then affect all other sections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

To begin [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities_in_notion | tracking personal finances]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> Here, users can find and manage all associated income and expenses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

### Adding and Modifying Accounts

## Tracking Income and Expenses in the Summary View

Once transactions are entered, the "Summary" section, specifically the "Finances" view, provides a real-time overview of income and expenses, aiding in [[tracking_profits_and_losses_within_notion | tracking profits and losses]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

In the "Finances" view:

*   It displays the total amount of income earned and total expenses incurred. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   A bifurcation shows the percentage contribution of each income or expense head to the total. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Changes made to transaction amounts in the "Transactions" section are immediately reflected here. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

## Additional Features for Comprehensive Tracking

Beyond basic income and expense tracking, the Notion system offers dedicated sections for various financial aspects:

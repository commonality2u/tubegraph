The accountant guy, Anath Biswal, introduces a travel expense tracker designed to help users monitor travel expenses and plan for future trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Template Overview

The tracker is organized into three main sections:
*   Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Overall Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Setting Up Accounts (Expense Categories)

The initial setup involves defining the types of expenses incurred during travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically [[organizing_expenses_into_categories_like_travel_meals_and_lodging | classified into categories]] such as travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Adding Expense Sources
To add a new specific expense source (e.g., Metro, Train):
1.  Click the "add expense source" button, which automatically adds it to the current travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon to edit the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, change the name to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | Set a budgeted amount]] for this expense source, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
4.  To move an expense source to a different category, click the three dots next to it and drag it under the desired section (e.g., meals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Adding New Categories
To create an entirely new expense category separate from the existing travel, meals, and lodging groups:
1.  Click the plus sign on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Select "create a new group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Each expense source has a [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | budgeted amount set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Expenses View

This section displays the total expenses incurred, the budgeted amount for each expense source, and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   If an expense exceeds its budget, it is indicated in red, for example, a $2,000 flight expense against a $1,000 budget shows 200% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Expenses within budget are shown in green, such as $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget, reflecting 33% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
This view provides a quick glance at spending against budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The summary section offers a complete overview of all travel-related finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   The overall percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, $3,600 incurred against a $6,068 budget reflects approximately 59% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

Expenses are classified under the same categories used in the accounts view: travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Quick addition buttons are available for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Steps to Add an Expense
1.  Click the relevant "add expense" button (e.g., "add travel expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This will add a new expense line with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  Add a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
3.  Input "trip info," which can be a general note about the trip (e.g., "trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
4.  Select the specific account for the expense (e.g., Train for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For example, $100 for a train expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

After booking, the expense updates automatically in the expenses summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If a budgeted expense was set (e.g., $200 for train), the summary will reflect the percentage spent (e.g., 50%) and color-code it appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

This [[tracking_expenses_with_notion | template]] allows users to [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_against_set_budgets | monitor expenses]] and plan effectively for future travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

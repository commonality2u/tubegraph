The Sales Performance OS template is designed to help users track and manage sales data efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It features a sales dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance by salesperson, sales channel, and sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Overview

The dashboard categorizes sales data into three main components, each segmented by month:
*   **Salesperson:** Tracks how much each salesperson has contributed in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For each person, it displays actual sales, targeted sales, the percentage of targeted sales achieved, and a status indicating if the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, otherwise "Target not achieved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel:** Represents the various sources from which sales are made, such as a website, Instagram, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It shows sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Sales Location:** Shows where sales have been made to different geographical locations, with the same sales characteristics displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

On the left side of the dashboard, an overview section provides total sales, sale units, and average sales per unit for:
*   **Salesperson Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   **Sales Channel Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   **Sales Location Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

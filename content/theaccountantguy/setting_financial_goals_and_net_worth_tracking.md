## Notion Tracker Overview

The Notion-based personal finance tracker is designed to help users track their finances comprehensively. It features three primary sections:
*   **Net Worth Target**: Users can specify a net worth goal for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Accounts**: This section allows for detailing different accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Summary**: Provides an "at a glance" view of entire finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The tracker also includes dedicated sections for:
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Net Worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Transactions: Where all financial movements related to income, expenses, assets, or liabilities are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Setting a Net Worth Target

To [[setting_financial_goals_in_notion | set financial goals in Notion]], specifically a net worth target, navigate to the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Here, you can define your desired net worth to achieve by the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. This target can be easily changed at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth Progress

The "Net Worth" section under the "Summary" view offers a complete [[using_notion_to_monitor_financial_summaries_and_net_worth | overview of your net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This section displays:
*   Your set net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   Your current total net worth, calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   The difference, showing how much you are "lagging behind" your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   The percentage of your net worth goal that has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   Total growth, which is the closing net worth minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

This feature allows for a clear understanding of your [[overview_of_net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth goal and progress tracking]] throughout the financial year.

### Account Setup for Net Worth

To effectively track net worth, you must define your assets and liabilities in the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Assets**: Include categories like savings funds (e.g., "Education Fund," "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Each asset can have a specific goal amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: Include debts like "Home Loan" or "Car Loan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Opening Balances**: Specify an opening balance for each asset and liability account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Transaction Entry for Net Worth

All transactions impacting your net worth (assets and liabilities) are recorded in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Asset Transactions**: When adding money to a savings fund, for example, navigate to the "Asset" section within "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This is typically an "outflow" transaction from your main bank account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Liability Transactions**: For debt payments, go to the "Liability" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Repaying a loan is an "outflow" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, while obtaining a new loan would be an "inflow" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The system automatically updates balances and calculations in the summary views, allowing for dynamic [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | fund and balance tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

The [[using_notion_formula_chatbot_for_notion_formula_questions | Notion Formula Chatbot]] is designed for Notion users who struggle to find the correct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas for Notion]] for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This chatbot aims to help users derive the exact formula they need when [[using_formulas_in_notion | using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin interacting with the chatbot, users must first input their OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. After entering the API key, the desired GPT model needs to be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Chatbot Interface

The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections:
*   **Info Section**: Provides details related to the chatbot, including an embedded explanatory video and contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Chat Section**: This is where users interact with the bot by typing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Give Section**: Contains a donate button for users who wish to support the product's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Testing the Chatbot with Questions

The chatbot responds instantly to questions and provides explanations alongside the formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Adding Two Numbers

A basic test involved asking for the formula to [[using_formulas_to_add_numbers_in_Notion | add two numbers in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The chatbot responded that `property A + property B` can be used, where Property A and B represent the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Finding Time Difference Between Dates

When asked for the formula to find the difference between a birth date and today's date in years, the chatbot suggested using the `dateBetween` formula, specifying 'years' as the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Using an IF Condition

To test more complex scenarios, a question involving an `if` condition was posed: "If number one is greater than number two, generate number one as the output; otherwise, generate number two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The chatbot demonstrated its fluency with `if` conditions, providing the correct formula and a detailed explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> The chatbot sometimes requires better prompting, such as providing proper examples or references, to generate the most accurate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Managing API Keys and GPT Models

### Generating an OpenAI API Key

To generate an OpenAI API key:
1.  Click the question mark icon next to the API key input field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  Follow the link provided, which redirects to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  Navigate to "API Keys" on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
5.  Fill in the details (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
6.  **Crucially, copy the generated key immediately**, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
7.  Paste this key into the chatbot's API key field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Users receive a $5 free credit upon creating an OpenAI account, which can be used for testing with the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Selecting GPT Models

The chatbot offers two GPT models:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: An older model that is less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This model is typically available with the free credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **GPT 4-106 Preview**: Recommended for paid OpenAI plans, as it provides better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

The demonstrations shown in the video were performed using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Customizing the Chatbot

### Customizing the User Icon

Users can upload an image to customize the user icon next to their questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is an optional, purely aesthetic feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Clicking the cross icon will revert it to the original user image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Changing Color Theme and Font

The chatbot's appearance can be customized:
1.  Click the three dots on the right side of the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
2.  Go to **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
3.  Under "App theme colors and font," a dropdown offers "Light," "Dark," and "System" theme options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
4.  Users can also edit the active theme and change specific colors or the font family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Expanding/Collapsing Left Panel

If the left panel (for API keys, etc.) is not visible, click the arrow icon on the left side of the chat window to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This is particularly useful for smartphone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Other Features

*   **Clear Chat History**: A button allows users to clear the conversation history, refreshing the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Conversations Counter**: Displays the number of conversations a user has had with the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Refresh Button**: In case of errors or issues, clicking the refresh button can resolve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

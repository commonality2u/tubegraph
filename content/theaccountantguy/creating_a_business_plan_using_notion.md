This article explains how to utilize a dedicated [[creating_and_using_templates_in_notion | Notion template]] to facilitate business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The [[using_templates_in_notion_for_business | business plan template]] offers two primary views: the Business Plan Road Map and the Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Business Plan Road Map

The Business Plan Road Map organizes the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template pre-defines 11 stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These stages range from "Conception & Research" to "Planning & Structuring," and extend to "Profitability & Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Users can edit these stages by clicking on the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Tracking Completion

For each business plan, objectives can be defined on the right side of the road map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can set objectives for a specific business plan and specify which stage it corresponds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A "completion in percentage" metric is included to track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Managing Tasks

Within each stage of the Business Plan Road Map, different tasks are associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, "Conception & Research" might have two defined tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Each task includes:
*   A deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   A checkbox to indicate task completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   A status that can be assigned based on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added by clicking on the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Documentation

At the bottom of each stage's view, there is a section for documentation where objectives and tasks can be specified in detail, providing more information about that specific stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Progress Updates

When tasks are marked as complete, the completion percentage for that stage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion percentage will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Completing both tasks will update it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This view displays specific deadline dates, such as December 3 to December 20 for certain stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The timeline shows:
*   The stage name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Associated tasks for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   The status of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

This view provides a quick overview of all planned items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Arrows indicate specific dates, and clicking on them will navigate to the details of all stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

By utilizing this [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Notion]] [[creating_and_using_templates_in_notion | template]], users can effectively plan their business by defining stages, tasks, deadlines, and tracking progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

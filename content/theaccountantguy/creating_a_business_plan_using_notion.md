[[managing_finances_using_notion | Notion]] offers a specialized business plan template designed to streamline the planning process for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template helps users organize and track various aspects of their business development.

## Template Views

The business plan template features two primary views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
*   **Business Plan Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Events Timeline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template pre-defines 11 stages, including:
*   Conception & Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning & Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability & Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Users can customize these stages by clicking the pencil icon to edit their names and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Tracking Progress

For each stage, users can define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The template also tracks a "completion in percentage" for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Managing Tasks

Within each stage, users can list associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For every task, it's possible to specify:
*   **Deadline**: When the task is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark the task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status**: Assign a status to the task (e.g., "Not started," "In progress," "Completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added by clicking the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Each stage also includes a documentation section at the bottom, where detailed objectives and tasks can be outlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Completion Update

The completion percentage for a stage automatically updates as tasks within that stage are marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion percentage will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. When all tasks are completed, it will reflect 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all planned stages and tasks in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The stage name and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Task status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

This provides a quick visual overview of the entire business plan's schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Users can click on arrows to navigate to specific dates and view details of all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

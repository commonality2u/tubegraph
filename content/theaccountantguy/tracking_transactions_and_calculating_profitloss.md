An Investment Portfolio Tracker can be utilized to [[tracking transactions and cash flow in business | track]] all investments, providing an overview of a portfolio and allowing for [[tracking transactions and expenses | transaction]] management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Investment Section
The investment section is structured into categories like stocks and cryptos, with the option to add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For each investment, users must input the opening balance and opening units at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

#### Portfolio Overview
The portfolio section reflects the investment value and available units after all [[tracking transactions and expenses | transactions]] have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It also indicates the investment percentage, showing each investment's proportion of the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

#### Profit and Loss Section
A dedicated [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit/loss]] section displays the total [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit]] or loss for each investment after all [[tracking transactions and expenses | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Individual [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit/loss]] figures are available for every investment, with a summation of [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit]] or loss at the top for each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Managing Investments
New investments can be quickly added using a "quick action button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking a pencil icon opens a panel to enter investment details, including name, opening balance, and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Investments can be categorized (e.g., under stocks or crypto) or new categories (groups) can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Existing items can be edited or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### The [[tracking transactions and expenses | Transaction]] Section
The [[tracking transactions and expenses | transaction]] section provides an overview of all carried out [[tracking transactions and expenses | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It features four distinct views:
*   **All:** Lists both sell and buy [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Buy:** Specifically for purchase [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Sell:** Specifically for sale [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **[[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | Profit and Loss]]:** Details the [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit]] or loss generated per [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

#### [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | Transaction]] Details
For every [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transaction]], users must input the date, description, type of [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transaction]] (buy/sell), investment account, and number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The price is automatically calculated based on buy/sell entries, and the amount is derived by multiplying units by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In the [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | Profit and Loss]] view, additional information like the buy price is displayed. The [[transaction_recording_and_profit_loss_calculation | profit]] or loss from a [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | transaction]] is calculated by subtracting the buy price from the sell price and multiplying by the number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For instance, selling 30 units bought at $10 for $40 each generates a profit of $900 ($30 profit per unit * 30 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

#### Quick Actions for [[tracking transactions and payment percentages | Transactions]]
"Buy Investment" and "Sell Investment" quick action buttons automatically add a new line item under the respective view, pre-filling the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Users can then modify the date and other details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

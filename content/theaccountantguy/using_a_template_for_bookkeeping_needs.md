This article details how to use a [[setting_up_a_small_business_bookkeeping_in_notion | small business bookkeeping template]] within Notion to manage all your financial tracking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Template Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

The template is organized into three main sections:
*   **Start Here** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>: Located at the top, this section is for initial business information setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>: Displays an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Transactions Window** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>: Where you input all business transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Setting Up in the "Start Here" Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

This section allows you to configure essential business information.

### Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
The accounts section is divided into four main categories:
*   **Expenses**: e.g., Purchase expense, Utility bills, Subscription, Salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: e.g., Accounts payable, Taxes payable, Accrued expenses, Credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

#### Managing Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Editing**: Hover over an item, click the pencil icon, make changes, and click outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Deleting**: Click the three-dot icon next to an item and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Adding**: Navigate to the desired category and click "New Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. New accounts added here will also appear in the transactions window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

#### Account Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
For each account, you can add:
*   **Opening Balance**: Enter carried-forward balances for liabilities and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Categorize items as bills, debt, savings, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> (e.g., utility bills classified as "bills", subscriptions as "subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This classification is used later in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Asset Class**: Classify assets as either "Inventory" or "Investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

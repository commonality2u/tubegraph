A debt payment tracker tool can help users manage their repayment schedules for various debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The tool categorizes debts and provides detailed information about each loan and its payment schedule.

## Debt Overview

The "debt overview" section divides debts into different categories, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For each debt, the following details are available:
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **EMI Amount** (Equated Monthly Installment) – The amount paid per installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment** – The date of the first installment payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By** – A calculated date indicating when the debt will be fully repaid if payments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs** – The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Customizing Repayment Categories

Users can add new repayment categories beyond the default annual and monthly options, such as "weekly" or "quarterly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The tool includes predefined schedules for common repayment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules, and the repayment schedule and associated calculations automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | Debt Payoff Progress]]

The debt payment tracker integrates the repayment schedules with a [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | debt payoff progress]] section, which displays a summary of all loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This summary includes:
*   Total amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Net payoff in percentage of the total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   The integrated "Debt Free By" date for quick reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Interest amount paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "transaction section" manages and records all debt payments made by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installments
This sub-section shows all paid debts, organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Users can mark an amount as paid by clicking a checkbox, which updates its status in the paid or unpaid columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Payment Details Entry
For each payment, users can input:
*   Payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Specific loan details (selected from previously added loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   EMI amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The tool automatically calculates the next repayment schedule based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For example, a student loan with monthly payments made on September 30th will have its next payment scheduled for October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Similarly, an annual home loan payment made on September 27, 2023, will show the next repayment in 2024 on the same date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

A "pay debt amount" button allows users to quickly add a new debt payment to the schedule, set to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. All entered details automatically update across the various sections of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

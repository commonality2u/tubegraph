## Setting Up and Tracking Finances

### [[Setting up income and expense tracking in Notion | Setting Up Income and Expense Tracking]]
To begin [[tracking_expenses_and_income_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Here, you can define income sources (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Adding/Modifying Accounts** Existing accounts can be modified via an edit button, and new accounts can be added with a "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Classification & Frequency** When setting up expenses, classify them (e.g., "bills," "subscriptions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) for recurring expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Income and expense accounts typically do not have opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### [[Tracking transactions and expenses in Notion | Recording Transactions]]
All transactions are fed into the "Transaction" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Views** The transaction section has different views: "All" for all transaction types (assets, liabilities, income, expense) and specific views for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Inputting Income** To record income, go to the "Income" view, click "New," select the date, add a description, link the relevant income account (e.g., salary), choose a payment mode (bank or cash), and select "inflow" as the transaction type, then specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Dates will automatically sort transactions by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Inputting Expenses** For expenses, follow the same process, but select "outflow" as the transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Tracking Income and Expenses Summary
The "Summary" section, specifically the "Finances" view, shows the aggregate of all recorded income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. It displays total amounts for each income and expense category, along with their percentage contribution to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Changes in transaction amounts instantly update the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Tracking Debt Payments
*   **Setting Up Debt Accounts** Under the "Account" section, navigate to "Liabilities" to add or modify debt accounts (e.g., home loan, credit card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Assign an opening balance, classify it as "debt," and set a payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Recording Debt Transactions** In the "Transactions" section, go to the "Liability" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. For loan repayments, select the date, debt account, payment mode, "outflow" as the transaction type, and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. If obtaining a new loan, set the transaction type to "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Debt Summary** The "Debt" view in the "Summary" section displays upcoming and past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Upcoming payments are those due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Past payments indicate missed or older payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. It also shows the total loan amount, percentage repaid, and remaining debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The layout of this view can be customized (e.g., list, gallery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Budgeting
The "Budget" section under "Summary" allows you to set estimated income and expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. It compares actual incurred expenses and earned income against these budgeted amounts, showing percentages of the budget utilized or exceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Budgeted amounts can be easily edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Setting Up and Tracking Savings
*   **Creating Savings Funds** Savings are considered assets, so create funds under the "Asset" section within "Accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Classify the account as "savings" and optionally set a goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Recording Savings Transactions** To add money to a savings fund, go to the "Asset" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Select the savings account, choose "outflow" as the transaction type (as money moves *out* of your primary account *into* the savings fund), and specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview** The "Savings" section in the "Summary" view will update to reflect the total amount saved and the percentage achieved towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Managing Bills
*   **Setting Up Bill Accounts** Under "Expenses" in the "Account" section, categorize accounts as "bills" (e.g., Wi-Fi bills, utility bills) and set their monthly or other payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Recording Bill Payments** Enter bill payments in the "Expense" section of "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Input date, description, account, payment mode, and "outflow" for the transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Bills Overview** The "Bills" section under "Summary" categorizes payments into "upcoming payments" (due after the current date) and "past payments" (indicating a potential missed payment if recent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Tracking Subscriptions
*   **Setting Up Subscription Accounts** In the "Account" section under "Expenses," classify relevant accounts (e.g., Netflix, Amazon) as "subscriptions" and define their payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Recording Subscription Payments** Add subscription expenses in the "Expense" section of "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Subscription Overview** The "Subscription" view in "Summary" operates similarly to the debt and bills sections, showing "upcoming payments" and "past payments" based on the payment frequency and last payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. It also displays the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### [[Tracking net worth in Notion | Monitoring Net Worth]]
Net worth is the difference between assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Setting a Goal** Define your desired net worth in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Summary** The "Net Worth" section under "Summary" displays the current net worth (assets - liabilities), the difference from your target, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. It also shows "total growth," which is the closing net worth less the opening net worth, calculated from initial opening balances of assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

### Tracking Investments
The system also allows for [[tracking_profits_and_losses_within_notion | tracking investments]] in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
*   **Setting Up Investment Accounts** Under the "Accounts" tab, create investment accounts (e.g., Apple investment, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. These are classified as "assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Specify an opening balance and opening units if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Crucially, set the asset class to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Recording Investment Transactions** In the "Asset" section of "Transactions", record investment purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
    *   **Purchases** Record purchases at their cost price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   **Sales** When selling, record the transaction at the *cost value* of the units sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. This enables the system to correctly calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
*   **Investment Overview** The "Investment" tab provides a summary of total investment amount, number of units, and the profit or loss from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. It also shows the percentage contribution of each investment to the total investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

## Special Considerations

### For Couples
The dashboard is also applicable for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. In the "Account" section, different categories of accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) can be split to denote ownership (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This allows for tracking finances for two individuals within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

### Accessing Specific Transactions
From the "Finances" summary view, you can click on any income or expense account (e.g., "Salary" or "Side Hustle") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. A "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom, which, when clicked, will automatically filter and display only the transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. This provides a quick way to review specific account activities without navigating to the main transactions page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

## Notion Specifics
*   **Device Compatibility** The template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.
*   **Cost** Notion is a free tool to use; you only need to sign up with an existing email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. There are no extra charges involved in using the system itself, beyond any template purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Multi-Currency Support** Notion supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. To change the currency displayed, navigate to any property with a currency symbol (e.g., in the "Transactions" or "Net Worth" views), click "Edit property," go to "Number format," and select your desired currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>. This needs to be done for all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

For [[managing_business_expenses_in_notion | businesses]] and [[managing_income_sources_in_notion | freelancers]], future editions of this template are planned to include features like client management, invoicing, resource tracking, and team management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.

This article outlines how to manage personal finances, including budgeting and savings, [[using_notion_for_budgeting_and_savings | using a Notion-based personal finance tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The tracker helps users keep an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of their finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, [[utilizing_notion_for_monthly_budget_planning | plan monthly budgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, track debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, and monitor their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. All financial transactions — income, expenses, assets, and liabilities — are fed into a central transaction section, which then affects all other tracked areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts for Income and Expenses

The first step in tracking personal finances is to set up accounts for income and expenses in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
Users can add or modify existing income (e.g., salary, side hustle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> and expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Classifying Expenses and Payment Frequency
When [[setting_budget_categories | setting budget categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, expenses can be classified as "bills" or "subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Users can also set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. When creating a new account, users specify the account name, an optional opening balance (usually not applicable for income/expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, its classification (e.g., bills, savings, subscription, debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, and the payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions
After setting up accounts, transactions are entered in the "Transactions" view, specifically under the "Income" or "Expense" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Adding Income Transactions
To add income, navigate to the "Income" section and click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Users input the date, a description (e.g., "salary income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, select the income account (e.g., "salary") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, choose the payment mode (bank or cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, set the transaction type to "inflow" (as money comes into the account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, and specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
For expenses, the process is similar to income, but the transaction type is "outflow" since money leaves the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Summary Overview of Income and Expenses
The "Summary" section, under the "Finances" view, displays all accounts classified under four heads: income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. It shows the total amount earned or spent for each account and its percentage contribution to the total income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Any changes in transaction amounts automatically update these summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Debt Management
Debt payments are tracked within the "Liabilities" section of the "Account" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Setting Up Debt Accounts
Users can add new debts (e.g., home loan, car loan, credit card) by clicking "New," providing a name, and specifying an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Debts are classified under the "Debt" category and typically have a monthly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Entering Debt Transactions
Debt transactions are entered under the "Liability" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Repayment:** Select the date, debt account, payment mode (bank/cash), and "outflow" as the transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The amount entered here reduces the total debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **New Loan:** If taking a new loan, change the transaction type to "inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
The system automatically bifurcates transactions by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Tracking Debt Payments
The "Debt" view under the "Summary" section shows "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Debts due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Past Payments:** Indicates payments that were due but not made within the expected period, based on the last payment date and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
This view also displays the total loan amount, the total repayment percentage, and the amount not yet paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Budgeting
The "Budget" section in the "Summary" view helps in [[monthly_budget_setup | setting up monthly budgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

It outlines incurred expenses and compares them against the total [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | budgeted amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Users can easily change the budgeted amount for any expense category, and the system automatically updates the percentage of the budget used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Similarly, it tracks estimated income against actual earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Savings Funds
Savings funds are treated as assets and are set up in the "Asset" section of the "Account" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Setting Up Savings Accounts
Users create new savings funds (e.g., "education fund," "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a> and classify them under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. A "goal amount" can be specified for each fund to track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

### Adding Savings Transactions
Transactions for savings are added under the "Asset" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. When money is transferred from a bank account to a savings fund, it's recorded as an "outflow" from the bank account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. The system then updates the savings fund with the amount and its percentage towards the set goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Bills Management
Bills are set up as expenses under the "Expenses" section of the "Account" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

### Setting Up Bill Accounts
Users classify specific expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Wi-Fi bills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> as "bills" and set their payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Entering Bill Transactions
Bill payments are entered under the "Expense" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The transaction type is "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Tracking Bill Payments
The "Bills" section in the "Summary" provides "Upcoming Payment" and "Past Payment" views, similar to debt tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. This helps users monitor due dates and identify any missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

## Subscription Tracking
Subscriptions are managed similarly to bills, classified as expenses in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Setting Up Subscription Accounts
Users add subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, classify them as "subscriptions," and set their payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### Entering Subscription Transactions
Subscription payments are entered under the "Expense" section of the "Transactions" view, recorded as "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### Tracking Subscription Payments
The "Subscription" view in the "Summary" section shows "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" based on the last payment date and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. It also displays the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Net Worth Tracking
Net worth is calculated as the difference between assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### Setting a Net Worth Goal
Users set a "Net Worth Target" for the financial year in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

### Tracking Net Worth Progress
The "Net Worth" section under "Summary" displays the current net worth (assets less liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, the difference from the target (how much is lagging behind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>, and the percentage of the net worth goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. It also tracks "Total Growth," which is the closing net worth minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Investment Tracking
The tracker includes an "Investment" tab to monitor investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### Setting Up Investment Accounts
Investment accounts are set up as assets in the "Accounts" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. They can have an opening balance and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, be classified as "stocks" or "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>, and must be designated with the "Investments" asset class for proper calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.

### Recording Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded under the "Asset" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** Must be recorded at their cost price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales:** Crucially, sales must be recorded at the *cost value* of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. This allows the system to accurately calculate profit or loss from the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

The "Investment" tab then shows the total investment value, units available, and profit or loss for each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

## Tracking Finances for Couples
Couples can also use this system by splitting different categories of accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For example, income can be denoted as "Salary by Him" or "Side Hustle by Her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. This allows for individual tracking within the shared dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Additional Features and FAQs

*   **Specific Transaction View:** Users can click on any account in the "Finances" summary view to open a window on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Scrolling down reveals a "View Transactions" button that, when clicked, automatically filters and displays all transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. This provides a quick way to review particular accounts without navigating to the main transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

*   **Device Availability:** The Notion template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

*   **Cost:** Notion is a free tool to use; no extra payment is required beyond the template's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

*   **Multiple Currencies:** Notion supports a wide range of currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. To change the currency, users need to locate properties with a dollar sign in their format (e.g., in the "Amount" column in transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>, click "Edit property," and change the "Number format" to their desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. This must be done for all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

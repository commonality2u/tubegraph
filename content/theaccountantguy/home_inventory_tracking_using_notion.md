A simple Notion template is available to help keep track of all your home inventory under one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template facilitates [[using_notion_for_inventory_management | using Notion for inventory management]] specifically for home items.

## Dashboard Overview

The template's dashboard provides a comprehensive overview, divided into financial metrics on the left and inventory management sections on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Financial Metrics (Left Side)

This section helps in [[tracking_expenses_with_Notion | tracking expenses with Notion]] and overall budget management:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Inventory Management (Right Side)

The right side of the dashboard is divided into three key sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>:

#### 1. Inventory Categories

This section allows for setting up different categories for your inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of categories include:
*   Dairy & Eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Fruits & Veggies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Under each category, you can list subcategories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and specify the estimated budgeted purchase for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

#### 2. Inventory Overview

This section provides key metrics for each subcategory of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

#### 3. Transaction Section

This is where you can specify all inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, enabling [[products_order_tracking_using_Notion | products order tracking using Notion]].
*   **Purchases**: Enter details such as the inventory item purchased (e.g., cheese), the subcategory, and the amount of purchase made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Consumption**: Add entries for items consumed, specifying the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Once these transaction entries are made, the template automatically updates all relevant sections, allowing you to track available inventory and consumption requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Customization

This template is entirely customizable to your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, making it suitable for [[customizing_notion_templates_for_home_inventory | customizing Notion templates for home inventory]].

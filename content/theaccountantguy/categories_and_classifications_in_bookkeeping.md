Effective bookkeeping for a small business relies on a structured approach to [[setting_up_accounts_and_classifications | accounts and classifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A small business bookkeeping template in Notion divides its structure into three main sections: "Start Here," "Summary," and "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The "Start Here" section is crucial for setting up the initial categories and classifications of the business's financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Core Account Categories

The template organizes financial data into primary account categories, each containing different specific accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
*   **Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
    *   Examples include purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, and salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
    *   Examples include accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, and credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

### Managing Accounts within Categories
Users can manage these accounts by:
*   **Editing Existing Items:** Hover over an item, click the pencil icon, edit details, and click anywhere outside to save changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Deleting Items:** Click the three-dot icon next to an item and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Adding New Items:** Go to the respective category and click "new page" to add a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Account Details and Classifications
For each account, additional details can be entered or selected:
*   **Opening Balance:** For liabilities and assets, users can input carried-forward balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Classification:** Items can be classified further as "bills," "debt," or "savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For example, utility bills might be classified as "bills," and subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This feature supports [[expense_categorization_and_analysis | expense categorization and analysis]] and [[using_categories_for_effective_expense_management | effective expense management]].
*   **Payment Frequency:** For recurring payments, users can choose frequencies like monthly, half-yearly, or quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This is useful for [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | budget management]].
*   **Opening Units:** For [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] or other assets, starting units can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** Assets can be classified as either [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] or [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Transaction Categorization

When entering transactions, the system leverages these predefined categories and classifications:
*   **Automatic Categorization:** When adding an income transaction, its category is automatically mapped to "income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Account Selection:** Users choose an account from the list set up in the "Start Here" section, and any new account added during transaction entry will also be reflected in the main account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The ideal approach is to set up accounts in the "Start Here" section first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This method helps in [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | using categories and transactions in Notion]].
*   **Payment Mode:** Transactions include a "payment mode" to specify how payments are received, such as through a bank or cash account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type:** Each transaction is classified as either an "inflow" (money coming into the account) or "outflow" (money going out of the account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Summary and Reporting by Category

All transactions entered are updated in the "Summary" section, providing an overview of business finances by category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>:
*   **Finances Section:** Provides an at-a-glance view of assets, income sources, liabilities, and expenses, reflecting values under their respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Debt Section:** Shows debt payments, distinguishing between past and upcoming payments, drawing from liability entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This supports [[categorizing_and_managing_charity_funds | managing debt]].
*   **Budgeting Section:** Displays budgeted expenses and income, total percentage of expenses incurred versus budget, and similar metrics for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Savings Section:** Tracks savings for specific funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Bills Section:** Shows past bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This can be used for [[classifying_and_managing_travel_expenses | managing recurring bills]].
*   **Subscriptions Section:** Similar to bills, tracks subscription payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Tax Section:** Provides quarterly tax payable amounts, tax credits, and tax liability based on income and expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Net Worth:** Reflects the business's net worth against a set goal, calculated from assets, liabilities, and all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Investment and Inventory:** Shows the status, value, and units for both [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | investments]] and [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary:** Displays total income, total expenses, gross profit, taxes paid, and net profit of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

By diligently setting up [[setting_up_accounts_and_classifications | accounts and classifications]] and entering transactions, the template automatically populates summary views, providing a comprehensive overview of business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

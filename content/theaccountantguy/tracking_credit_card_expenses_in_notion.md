This article details a Notion-based credit card expenses tracker designed to help users monitor all their credit card payments and manage debt effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template is customizable to personal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This system aids in [[expense_tracking_using_notion | expense tracking using Notion]] and [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting and tracking expenses in Notion]].

## Tracker Overview

The tracker provides several sections for a comprehensive view of credit card finances:

### Credit Cards Overview
This section displays all added credit cards, showing the total amount due, the amount repaid so far, and the remaining balance due for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In a demonstration, four credit cards were added: Student Credit Card, Cash Back Credit Card, Travel Credit Card, and Rewards Credit Card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Monthly Overview
A monthly breakdown indicates the amount due, amount repaid, and balance due for each month, which can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, this section shows the total amount due, amount repaid, and balance due annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Expense Details
This section lists all expenses that have been added in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Expenses Overview
This provides a summary of all booked expenses categorized by type, displaying total expenses, budgeted amounts, and whether expenses are "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for [[managing_business_expenses_using_notion | managing business expenses using Notion]] and [[how_to_use_notion_for_tracking_business_expenses | how to use Notion for tracking business expenses]].

### Notification Section
This feature shows upcoming repayment dates and the number of days remaining until the next repayment for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This helps users pay their credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Using the Tracker

### Booking Expenses
To begin using the tracker, expenses are entered under the "Expense Details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For each expense, the following details are recorded:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   **Expense Details** (e.g., opening balance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Period** (month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Credit Card** (linked to the expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   **Category** (assigned to the expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   **Repayment Amount** (when a payment is made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

Opening balances from previous months can be entered in the "opening balance due" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Repayments are simply typed as "credit card repayment" and the amount is placed in the repayment column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. All overview sections at the top automatically update as details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This process contributes to comprehensive [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking income and expenses in Notion]].

### Managing Budgets
In the "Expenses Overview" section, users can see incurred expenses per category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. To set a budget amount, simply click on the "budget amount" field and enter the desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The system then compares total expenses to the budgeted amount, indicating "under budget" or "over budget" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. For example, an expense of $5,300 against a budget of $5,000 would show "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is a core aspect of [[using_notion_for_expense_management | using Notion for expense management]].

### Setting Repayment Notifications
The "notification section" allows users to set specific repayment dates for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Once set, the tracker displays how many days are remaining until the next repayment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Views

### Editing Credit Cards and Categories
Users can edit existing credit card information or add new credit cards and categories directly within the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Categories can also be added by entering details in the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Receipt Column
In the "Expense Details" section, there is a "receipt" column where users can attach bills or receipts for their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Detailed Summarization Views
The tracker offers various detailed views for different criteria:
*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (month) opens a new window showing transaction details like date, period, transaction details, amount, and a tag (green for repayment, red for expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Clicking on a year provides similar transaction information for that specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Credit Card View**: Selecting a particular credit card displays all transactions related to it, along with its status and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This is useful for [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | tracking invoice payments in Notion]].
*   **Category View**: Clicking on an expense category shows all associated expenses and their relevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This can be adapted for specific needs like [[tracking_restaurant_expenses_with_notion | tracking restaurant expenses with Notion]].

A savings funds tracker in [[Notion]] helps manage and monitor your savings goals and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This dynamic tracker includes a dashboard with two main views: Savings Target and Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It also features a transactions panel for recording individual savings contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Savings Target View

The "Savings Target" view is where you define your different savings funds and their corresponding target or goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds
To [[editing_and_deleting_savings_funds_in_notion | edit any of the existing savings funds]], click on the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
1.  **Rename a fund**: Type the new name (e.g., "Car Fund") into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The name will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Adjust Goal Amount**: Click on the current goal amount and enter a new figure (e.g., changing $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Changes will automatically update in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

You can also edit details by clicking directly on the entry, which opens a window with options to change the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds
To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon and give the new fund a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Hit enter to add it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  Set the goal amount by clicking on the default amount (e.g., $1,000) and entering your desired target (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds
To [[editing_and_deleting_savings_funds_in_notion | delete a savings fund]]:
1.  Click the six dots on the left side of the fund's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Savings Overview View

The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of your savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays the total amount saved, the targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This view automatically updates as you add transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Transactions Panel

The transactions panel is located at the bottom of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> and is used to record individual contributions to your savings funds.

### Adding New Transactions
1.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
2.  **Enter Information**:
    *   **Date**: The date automatically defaults to the current system date, but you can change it using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   **Description**: Add a description for your saving (e.g., "Saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Saving Fund**: Click on the "Saving Fund" column to select which of your predefined savings funds this transaction contributes to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Saving Amount**: Enter the amount saved in this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Impact on Overview
As soon as you add an amount to a transaction, it automatically populates and updates the total savings for that specific fund in the Savings Target view, and the overall progress in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. For example, adding $1,000 to a "Car Fund" with a previous total of $1,400 will update the car fund's total savings to $2,400, reflecting 80% of a $3,000 target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Grouping Transactions
Transactions are grouped by month by default, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. You can change this grouping:
1.  Click the three dots in the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Select "Group by date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
3.  Choose to group by "Week" or "Year" instead of "Month" to dynamically change how your savings are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Currency Customization

The savings funds tracker supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
1.  Click on any amount field (e.g., a dollar amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
3.  Under "Number format," you will find all the different currencies supported by [[Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The tracker is dynamic and customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

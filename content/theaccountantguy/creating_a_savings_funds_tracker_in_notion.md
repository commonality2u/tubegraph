The Notion savings funds tracker offers a comprehensive dashboard to monitor your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is designed to help users set savings targets and track their progress towards those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Savings Funds Dashboard Overview

The savings funds dashboard features two primary views:
*   **Savings Target** This section allows you to define different saving funds and their corresponding target amounts, representing the total savings you aim to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview** This view provides a summary of how much you have saved in total against your set targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays the total savings made, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Managing Savings Targets

The "Savings Target" view comes with pre-added default savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To modify an existing savings fund:
1.  Click the pencil icon next to the fund you wish to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., changing it to "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Set a new goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Any changes made here will automatically update in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can click directly on the entry to open up all editing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings goal:
1.  Click the "add savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon for the new entry to give it a name (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Set your desired goal amount. By default, it might be $1,000, but you can change it to any amount, such as $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

If you need to remove a savings fund:
1.  Click the six dots located on the left side of the specific saving fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  Select the "delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Tracking Savings Transactions

To record contributions to your savings funds, use the transactions panel at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Adding New Transactions

1.  Click the "add transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
2.  Transactions are grouped by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  You can adjust the date of the transaction using the calendar pop-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Linking Transactions to Funds and Entering Amounts

1.  Enter a description for the transaction, such as "saving for car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
2.  In the "saving fund" column, click to select the specific fund this transaction contributes to (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the saving amount. This amount will automatically update the total savings displayed in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   For example, if your "car fund" had $1,400 saved and you add $1,000, the total will update to $2,400 out of a $3,000 goal, reflecting 80% achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Features

This Notion tracker is highly dynamic and customizable.

### Currency Customization

The tracker supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To change the currency:
1.  Click on any amount field that displays currency (e.g., the dollar sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
2.  Select "edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
3.  Choose from the various number formats and currencies supported by Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Assistance is available for setting up the template in a different currency post-purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Dynamic Grouping of Transactions

The transaction view can be grouped by different timeframes:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Under "grouping," you can see that it's initially set to group by "date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  Click on the date property settings to change the grouping to "week" or "year" instead of "month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This will dynamically adjust how your savings transactions are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This tracker is fully customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

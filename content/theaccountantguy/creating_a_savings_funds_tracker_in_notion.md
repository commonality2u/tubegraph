This article details how to set up and manage a savings funds tracker within [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | Notion]], designed to help users monitor their savings goals and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Savings Funds Dashboard

The savings funds dashboard features two primary views: the "Savings Target" and the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Savings Target

The "Savings Target" view allows users to establish different saving funds and set a corresponding target or goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

#### Editing Existing Savings Funds

By default, three savings funds are pre-added with goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
To edit an existing saving fund:
1.  Click the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., changing "Emergency Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the goal amount by clicking on the amount and entering a new value (e.g., changing $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Changes automatically update in the savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
Alternatively, users can click directly on the fund entry to open detailed options, allowing editing of the name and goal amount from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

#### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear below the existing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon next to the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  Give the new fund a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Set the goal amount by clicking on the default $1,000 and entering the desired amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Deleting Savings Funds

To delete an added saving fund:
1.  Click the six dots located on the left of the fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Savings Overview

The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays the total amount saved, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Transactions Panel

The transactions panel, located at the bottom of the tracker, is used to record contributions to specific savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Adding New Transactions

To add a new savings transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  All transactions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The date can be changed using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund to which the contribution is being made (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  Enter the saving amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Once an amount is added, it automatically populates the total savings for that fund and updates the percentage achieved in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, if a car fund had $1,400 saved and a $1,000 transaction is added, the total savings becomes $2,400, reflecting an 80% achievement towards a $3,000 goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This provides a dynamic overview of savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Grouping Transactions

The transaction view can be grouped by different timeframes:
1.  Click the three dots in the transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Under "Grouping," select "By Date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  Choose to group by month (default), week, or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This dynamically changes how savings contributions are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Customization and Support

The tracker is completely dynamic and customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Currency Customization

The currency displayed in the tracker can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
1.  Click on any amount displaying the dollar currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  Choose a different currency from the "Number Format" options, as [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | Notion]] supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Assistance is available for setting up the template with a different currency post-purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

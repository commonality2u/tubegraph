A savings funds tracker in Notion helps manage personal finances by providing a clear overview of saving targets and progress. The template includes a dashboard with two main views: "Savings Target" and "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is part of a broader set of Notion templates for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances]] or specifically for [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | tracking personal finances using Notion]].

## Savings Funds Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your savings progress:

*   **Savings Target**
    This view allows users to set different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview**
    This section gives a total overview of how much has been saved so far against the set target amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays the total savings made, the targeted saving amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Managing Savings Targets

The tracker comes with default savings funds that can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To edit an existing saving fund:
1.  Click on the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., from a default name to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  Set or change the goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Any changes made here will automatically update in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
4.  Alternatively, click on the fund name itself to open its details and edit the name or goal amount directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new saving fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This will add a new entry below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon for the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Set the goal amount of your choice; new funds default to $1,000 but can be changed (e.g., to $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

To delete a saving fund:
1.  Click on the six dots located on the left side of the fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Tracking Savings Transactions

To add actual savings to a fund and update the overview:
1.  Navigate to the "Transactions" panel at the bottom of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This adds a new transaction with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Transactions are grouped by month, with later months appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  Click on the date to change it using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "Saving for Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
5.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund this transaction contributes to (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
6.  Input the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   The total savings for that fund in the "Savings Overview" will automatically update to reflect the new amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, if a car fund had $1,400 saved and a new $1,000 transaction is added, the total becomes $2,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Customization and Features

*   **Currency Support**: The tracker supports different currencies. By clicking on any amount field and selecting "Edit Property," you can access "Number Format" to choose from various currencies Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Assistance is available for setting up the template with a different currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Views**: The transaction view is dynamically grouped by month by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Users can change this grouping to week or year by clicking on the three dots, then "Grouping," and selecting the desired date format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Customizability**: The entire template is customizable to fit individual requirements and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

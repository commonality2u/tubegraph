### Creating a New Bill Reminder Template

    *   Select "New Template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  **Input Bill Details**:
    *   Start writing the name of your bill, e.g., "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   Specify the bill amount, e.g., $1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   Click "back" to save the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Setting Recurring Reminders

Once the template is created, you can set it to repeat on a recurring basis:

1.  **Access Recurring Settings**:
    *   Click on the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
    *   Click on the three dots next to the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   Select the option to "repeat on the recurring basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  **Configure Recurrence**:
    *   Choose the frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Specify the exact time and date for the notification, e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Automation for WhatsApp Notifications

For the reminders to be sent to WhatsApp, an automation platform like Pabbly Connect is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation workflow is set up within Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide are typically included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once this automation is configured, you will automatically receive notifications on WhatsApp whenever a template is set on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Notification Timing

Notifications are typically sent out promptly. For instance, a message set for 11:55 AM on September 20th was received at 11:56 AM, demonstrating that it takes under a minute for the notification to be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!TIP]

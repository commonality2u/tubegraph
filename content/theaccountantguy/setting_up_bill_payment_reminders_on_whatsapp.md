Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy, demonstrates how to set up bill payment reminders directly on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system allows you to receive automated notifications for upcoming bills, such as a Wi-Fi bill due September 20th for $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Creating a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the provided drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Start writing your bill details, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "back" to save the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Up Recurring Reminders

For [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring bill payment reminders]]:
1.  Click the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and date when you want to receive the notification, for instance, 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This setup will ensure you receive a notification at the specified time on WhatsApp every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

To enable these reminders, assistance from an automation tool like Pabbly Connect is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The entire automation setup in Pabbly Connect is explained in a detailed guide included with the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Once this automation is configured, notifications will be automatically sent to your WhatsApp whenever a template is set on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Receiving Notifications

When a bill is due, like a mobile bill set for 11:55 AM on September 20th, a new entry will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Shortly after the set time, a notification will be received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, a notification set for 11:55 AM on September 20th might arrive around 11:56 AM, demonstrating that it typically takes under a minute for the notification to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This process ensures you receive notifications for every bill added to the system each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

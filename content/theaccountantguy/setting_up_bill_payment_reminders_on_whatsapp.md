This guide demonstrates how to set up bill payment reminders directly on your WhatsApp account, ensuring you receive timely notifications for upcoming payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Creating a New Reminder

To [[creating_new_bill_payment_reminders | create a new bill payment reminder]]:
1.  Click on the relevant drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "New template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the bill, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, for example, $1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

An example of a reminder might be for a Wi-Fi bill, with a due date of September 20th and a payment amount of $3000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting Recurring Notifications

After creating the bill, you can [[setting_recurring_notifications_for_bills | set it to repeat on a recurring basis]]:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Choose the frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day you wish to receive the notification (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Save the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once set, the system will automatically send notifications to your WhatsApp at the specified time each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation Integration

This functionality requires the help of [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation]], specifically using a platform like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A template and a detailed guide on setting up the entire automation workflow in Pabbly Connect are provided when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Once this automation is configured, you will consistently receive WhatsApp notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. When a template is set for recurring payments, notifications will be sent automatically every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Notification Example

When a bill is due and the notification time is reached, a new bill item will be automatically added to your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, if a "Mobile bill" notification was set for 11:55 AM on September 20th, the system shows it being added around 11:54 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Shortly after, a notification will be received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Notifications are typically sent within a minute of the set time (e.g., set for 11:55 AM, received at 11:56 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

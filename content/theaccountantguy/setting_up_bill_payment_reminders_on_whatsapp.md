### Automation with Pabbly Connect

To enable these reminders, automation software like Pabbly Connect is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A template for this automation setup is provided, including a detailed explanation and guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once the automation is configured, you will automatically [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | receive notifications]] on WhatsApp each month based on the recurring template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Receiving Notifications

Once the template is set for recurring payments, notifications will be sent automatically to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For example, if a mobile bill is set for 11:55 AM on the 20th of the month, a notification will be received on WhatsApp shortly after that time, typically within a minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

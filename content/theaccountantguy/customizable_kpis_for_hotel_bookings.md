From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 
The Notion hotel booking form tracker offers key performance indicator (KPI) information at the top of its interface to help users track hotel bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Default KPIs

The template displays two main types of KPI information by default:
*   **Bookings by Room Type** This shows the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests** This KPI indicates how many guests require free pickup services, separated into "Yes" and "No" counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Customizable Aspects of the Template

The hotel booking tracker is designed to be entirely customizable to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Room Type Customization
Users can select from pre-added room types or create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When a new room type is typed in, it automatically creates a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The icon for a new room type can also be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Any changes made to room types in the main table automatically update and sync with the KPI information at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Expanding KPI Data
While the guest count for a particular reservation is entered in the table, it is not displayed in the default KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, this can be added with certain customizations to the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Customization Support
For further customization of the template, users can reach out via email to notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The template functions by automatically reflecting details added in the bottom table at the top for required insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

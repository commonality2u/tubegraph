The business cash flow template in Notion allows you to [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | manage accounts]] by setting up and categorizing different financial elements of your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Accessing the Account Section

On the right side of the cash flow overview, you can find the "Account Section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Clicking on this section reveals the various types of accounts you can set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Types of Accounts

The template categorizes accounts under different heads:
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   **Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

## Managing Account Items

You can add your own items or edit existing ones within each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Adding a New Item
To add a new item under any category (Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses), click the "New" button in the respective section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Editing an Existing Item
To edit an existing item, click on the pencil icon next to the item name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This allows you to change the name and other associated values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Account Item Properties

Each account item has several properties that can be set or edited:

### Opening Balance
This is the starting balance of an asset or account when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Classifications
Classifications help categorize how a specific item is grouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For example, a credit card might be classified as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   You can select from several existing classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   To add a new classification, you can do so directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   To edit an existing classification, click the three-dot icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Payment Frequency
This property specifies how frequently payments are received or made for a particular item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is particularly useful for income and expense tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For instance, interest income might have a quarterly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Opening Units
This property is relevant for items like investments or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For example, you can specify an opening unit count for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Asset Class
This is applicable when dealing with inventory or investments under the asset category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. You can designate items as "Inventory Asset Class" or "Investment Asset Class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Once accounts are assigned and set up, you can proceed to add transactions, which track the cash flow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. All accounts you set up here will be available for selection when entering transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Examples include Student, Cash Back, Travel, and Rewards credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

*   **Monthly Overview**
    This section shows the amount due, repaid, and the balance due for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It can be customized to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Expense Detail Section**
    This section provides a detailed view of all expenses that have been added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **Expenses Overview**
    This area offers an overview of expenses booked into different categories. It includes the total expenses added, the budgeted amount, a comparison of expenses to the budgeted amount, and whether the budget is "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Notification Section**
    This section alerts users to the next repayment due date and the number of days remaining until that date for each added credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Utilizing the Tracker

To begin using the tracker, expenses must be entered under the [[navigating_the_budget_tab_for_income_and_expenses | expense details overview section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Booking Expenses

The expense details section includes fields for:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Related credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Repayment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

For any balances carried forward from the previous month, an "opening balance due" can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. When entering a repayment, it should be identified as "credit card repayment" in the details and the amount entered in the repayment column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. All entered details automatically update the overview sections at the top of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Managing Expenses and Budget

The [[business_budget_template_overview | expenses overview section]] allows users to see incurred expenses for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Users can set a budgeted amount for each expense category by simply clicking on the budget amount field and entering the desired value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This action immediately updates all expense details in relation to the new budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The system indicates whether spending is "under budget" or "over budget" based on the comparison of actual expenses to the set budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Setting Repayment Notifications

The notification section is crucial for [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | timely debt management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Users can set their own repayment dates for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The tracker then displays how many days are remaining until the next repayment date, helping users track and pay their credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Features

The tracker offers flexibility for customization:

*   **Editing and Adding Credit Cards/Categories**
    Credit card information can be edited using a pencil icon, and new credit cards can be added via a "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Categories can also be added and edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Receipt Column**
    A receipt column allows users to attach bills or receipts for made expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

*   **Summarization Views**
    The tracker provides summarized views based on period, year, or specific credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. These views show transaction details (date, period, description, amount) and a tag indicating whether it's a repayment (green) or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Credit card-specific views also show the status of each card and allow for category assignment to the card itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Clicking on any category provides a detailed view of associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

This template is designed to be customizable to personal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

The Accountant's Guide presents a personal finance tracker spreadsheet designed to [[using_google_sheets_for_financial_tracking | track income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This tool is built with three main tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Additionally, a "Start Here" tab provides necessary instructions for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Setting up the Budget Tab

To begin [[using_google_sheets_for_personal_finance | tracking personal finance]], the initial step involves navigating to the "Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Here, users need to:

*   **Feed Account Details** Input details for accounts related to both income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Specify Monthly Amounts** Define the budgeted expenses or income goals for each account on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Categorization** Accounts should be categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount Column** This column automatically totals the amounts entered for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It is a formula-driven column, so for new line items, the formula must be dragged down to copy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Adding Rows** To add new rows, select the desired number of rows and click "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Adding Transactions in the Transactions Tab

After the budget setup is complete, the next step is to navigate to the "Transactions" tab to add new transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In this tab, users can input:

*   **Date** The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Category** The category related to the transaction, which links to the accounts specified in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Type** A formula-driven property that specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This formula needs to be dragged and pasted for new line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount** The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Analyzing Data in the Dashboard Tab

Once transactions are entered, the "Dashboard" section provides an analysis of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The dashboard's display is controlled by filters for:

*   **Category** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   **Period** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   **Type of Reference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

The dashboard includes:

*   **Summary** Displays total income, total expense, and net balance for the selected period and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Income Overview** Specifies different sources of income earned during the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview** Shows income, expense details, and net balance for each month recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Users can filter the data to view total income for a specific period (e.g., 2023) or drill down into individual income sources like "salary" to see relevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

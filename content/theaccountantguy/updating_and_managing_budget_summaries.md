## Expense and Category Management

The template features a table that lists all expenses individually, along with their respective categories and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

*   **Entering Expenses**
    *   The amount of each expense is listed in the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
    *   Users can directly enter the amount on the expense side, and it will update the summary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **[[setting_budget_categories | Setting Budget Categories]]**
    *   Categories are reflected in the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   Users can [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | define their own categories]] by clicking a pencil icon, which updates the system in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   New categories can be added by clicking on "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Existing categories can be edited by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Once these values are updated, all related figures in the template are immediately refreshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[budgeted_expenses_summary | Budgeted Expenses Summary]]

The summary section provides a concise [[utilizing_notion_for_financial_summaries_and_budgeting | overview of financial information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This section displays:

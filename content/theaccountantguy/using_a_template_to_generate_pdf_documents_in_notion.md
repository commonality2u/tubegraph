This article explains how to [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | generate PDF documents]] using a Notion database and a pre-defined template with the help of PDF output software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The process is demonstrated using a boarding pass example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | generate PDF documents]] from Notion, you need:
*   A database in Notion containing the details you want to include in your PDFs, such as a "boarding pass database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A Notion template, like a "boarding pass template," designed for PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Generation Process

1.  **Initiate Connection**: In the PDF output application's connection details, type the name of your document type, e.g., "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database**: Select the Notion database you wish to use for the PDF generation, such as the "boarding pass database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Select Template**: Choose the Notion template that will be used for the PDF layout, for instance, the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to begin loading all the information from both the selected database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once the information is loaded, click "export" to start [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdf_output | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Verifying Generated PDFs

After the export is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   You can click "preview sample" to view a generated PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This preview will show the document (e.g., a boarding pass) with all details pulled from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Download the generated files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Once downloaded, extract and open the files to see multiple PDF outputs, each with different details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This process allows for efficient [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_using_notion | bulk PDF document generation]] directly from your Notion data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The Notion [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] is designed to help users manage their financial savings goals by tracking target amounts and actual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It provides a dashboard with two main views: the "Savings Target" and the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Savings Target View
This section allows users to set different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
By default, the tracker includes three pre-added saving funds with goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds
To modify an existing savings fund:
*   Click the pencil icon next to the fund to rename it, e.g., to "car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon to adjust the goal amount, e.g., changing from $2,500 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Alternatively, clicking directly on the savings fund entry itself opens all editing options for the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
Any changes made here automatically update the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds
To add a new savings fund:
*   Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This adds a new entry below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon to give the new fund a name, such as "new saving fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Set the desired goal amount for the new fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds
To remove a savings fund:
*   Click the six dots located on the left side of the specific fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Savings Overview
This view provides a summary of the total amount saved, the overall targeted saving amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions
The "Transactions Panel" at the bottom of the dashboard is used to add new contributions to savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Adding Transactions
*   Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry automatically appears with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Transactions are grouped by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Users can select a different date from the calendar within the transaction entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund this transaction contributes to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Input the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Automatic Updates
As soon as a saving amount is added to a transaction, it automatically updates the total savings for that specific fund in the "Savings Overview," reflecting the new total and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Using Different Currencies
The Notion [[notion_sinking_funds_tracker_setup | savings funds tracker]] supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
To change the currency format:
*   Click on any amount field (e.g., with a dollar currency symbol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   From the "Number format" options, choose the desired currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Notion supports various global currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Dynamic Views and Customization
The transaction view can be dynamically changed to show data grouped by different timeframes:
*   By default, transactions are grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   By clicking the three dots on the view and then selecting "Grouping," users can change the grouping from "month" to "week" or "year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:05:01]</a>.
This allows for flexible viewing of savings progress on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The template is customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

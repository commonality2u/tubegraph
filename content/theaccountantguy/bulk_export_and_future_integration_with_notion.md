When [[exporting PDF documents from Notion | generating PDF documents]] for purchase orders, users can choose between single or [[bulk_generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | bulk export]] modes using PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.

## Bulk Export Mode

To [[generating_pdfs_in_bulk_with_notion | export multiple documents]] in one go, users can click on the "bulk export mode" within PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

In this mode, users must fill in all the necessary details, similar to the information maintained in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Multiple rows can be added by clicking "add new row" to input information for various documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

Once all details are filled, users have two options:
*   Download individual documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   [[generating_pdf_invoices_in_bulk_with_notion | Download all documents]] at once by clicking "download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. The system will download them one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Future Notion Integration

Future plans include [[integrating_notion_with_pdf_output_for_document_creation | Notion integration]] that will support direct use of Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This will provide an option to select a Notion database directly from the PDF output interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

With this integration, users will be able to directly add information and generate PDFs by reading data from their Notion database with a single click on "export" or "download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

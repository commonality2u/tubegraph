This article provides a guide on navigating and utilizing the budget tab within a personal finance tracker spreadsheet. This spreadsheet includes three primary tabs: the Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Navigating the Budget Tab

To begin, you must first navigate to the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This section is crucial for setting up your [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | income and expense]] accounts and [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | budget targets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Feeding Account Details

In the Budget tab, you need to input details related to all your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For each account, you will:
*   Add the account name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Categorize it as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Specify the budgeted amount for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Goal Amount Column

The "Goal Amount" column automatically totals the amounts you've entered for each month for a specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. As you update the monthly figures, the goal amount will reflect these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Formula-Driven Column
> The "Goal Amount" column is formula-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When adding new line items, ensure you drag the formula down to copy it to the newly added rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Adding New Rows

If you need to add more accounts, you can simply select the desired number of rows at the end of the tab and click "Add" to insert new rows at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Next Steps

Once you have completed specifying all your [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | budget]] estimations and accounts in the Budget tab, the next step is to navigate to the Transactions tab to add new transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This forms the foundation for effective [[income_and_expense_management | income and expense management]] and [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget management]].

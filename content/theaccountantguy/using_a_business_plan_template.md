Anat Biswal, "the accountant guy," provides guidance on how to utilize a business plan template for efficient business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Template Views

The business plan template offers two primary views to manage planning:
1.  The [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
2.  The [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

## Business Plan Road Map

The [[business_plan_road_map_stages | business plan road map]] view organizes the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template pre-defines 11 stages, including:
*   Conception & Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning & Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability & Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Users can customize or edit these stages using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Setting Objectives and Tracking Completion

For each stage, users can [[setting_objectives_for_a_business_plan | set objectives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Each objective can be linked to a specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The template also includes a completion percentage tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Managing Tasks

Within each stage, different tasks are associated with the business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, "Conception & Research" might have two distinct tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For every task, users can specify:
*   A deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   A checkbox to mark the task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   A status (e.g., "in progress," "done") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

New tasks can be added by clicking the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Documentation

At the bottom of each stage's detailed view, there is a documentation section where users can specify objectives and tasks in greater detail, providing more context about the stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Completion Updates

The template automatically updates the overall completion percentage for a stage when tasks are marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion percentage will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. If both tasks are completed, it will become 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] view presents all planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   The stage name and associated task for each entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   The date and status of each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

This offers a quick overview of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Users can click on arrows within the timeline to navigate to specific dates and view detailed information for all stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

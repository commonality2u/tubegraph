[[budgeting_and_saving_with_Notion | Budgeting in Notion]] for each month can be achieved using a monthly budget planner template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system tracks expenses and compares them against set budgets, providing an overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Overview of the Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner typically includes four different views for tracking finances:
*   **Expenses Overview** Tracks individual expense categories, showing total expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage of budget incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Example categories include shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** Displays all tracked expenses in a categorized monthly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Presents the same information as the monthly overview but aggregated by year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary** Provides a complete overview of expenses in a yearly format, grouping all expenses to show overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

All data for these views is derived from the "expense details database" where transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | enter transactions]] into the system, follow these steps using the expense details database:
1.  **Access the Database** All expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  **Add New Entry** Click on the "new" button to start a new transaction entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
3.  **Enter Date** Input the transaction date, for example, "February 1, 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The system automatically adjusts the month if the date is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

5.  **Select Period** Choose the relevant period, e.g., "Feb 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Custom periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
6.  **Select Year** Specify the year, e.g., "2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
7.  **Select Category** Choose the type of expense from pre-defined categories like "utilities," "shopping," "entertainment," or "food." New categories can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
8.  **Enter Expense Code** This code segregates expenses by category and month, e.g., "utility Feb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
9.  **Input Expense Amount** Enter the actual amount spent in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Setting and Adjusting Budgets

At the beginning of each month, users can [[customizing_the_notion_budget_template | set a budget]] for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This is done in the "expense details database" using the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Steps to Set a Budget
1.  **Select Date** Choose the first day of the month for which the budget is being set, e.g., "February 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Enter Expense Name** Input the name of the expense for which the budget is being set, e.g., "food expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Select Period** Choose the corresponding month, e.g., "February" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Select Year** Specify the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  **Select Category** Choose the relevant category, ensuring the expense name and category name are the same for budget entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
6.  **Enter Expense Code** Input the expense code, which is typically the category followed by the month and year, e.g., "food Feb 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  **Input Budget Amount** Enter the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once a budget is set, all figures in the overview sections will automatically update for the respective months and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. As transactions are continuously added, the system automatically updates the displayed information, allowing users to track monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

The budget planner allows for detailed financial analysis:
*   **Period View** Clicking on a specific period (e.g., Feb 2024) reveals a new window with all booked transactions for that period, showing amounts and indicating whether each entry was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View** Similarly, clicking on a year provides a view of budgeted amounts, actual expenses, expense percentages, and budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View** Users can see how much has been spent for a particular category, including expense and budgeted amounts, expense percentages, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all transactions related to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View** From the expense code, users can quickly see the amount booked for a specific category within a particular month compared to its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This detailed tracking helps users understand and manage their finances by providing insights into budgeting performance across various categories and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

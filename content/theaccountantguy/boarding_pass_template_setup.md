Notion can be used to [[generating_boarding_pass_pdfs_using_notion | generate boarding pass PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This process involves utilizing a boarding pass database and a specific template for generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Requirements

To generate boarding pass PDFs, two main components are needed:
*   A boarding pass database that contains all the necessary details for the boarding passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A dedicated boarding pass template from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Process for Generation

The steps to generate boarding pass PDFs are as follows:

1.  In the connection details section, type "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Specify "PDF output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
3.  Type "boarding pass database" to connect to the database containing flight details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
4.  Select the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
5.  Click "next" to load all the information from the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
6.  Once the information is loaded, click "export" to begin generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Output

After a successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   A preview sample can be viewed, showing the generated boarding pass with all details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The generated files can be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Multiple PDF outputs can be generated, each with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This utility allows for the generation of PDF documents directly from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Notion Expenses Tracker allows users to manage all their expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. A key feature of this tracker is the ability to [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customize expense categories]] to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Category Management

The tracker includes a category section at the top, initially featuring three distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. These categories can be defined and customized by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Renaming Categories

To rename an existing category:
1.  Hover over the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  A pencil icon will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
4.  Rename the category as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
5.  Press `Enter` to save the new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Editing and Deleting Categories

To edit or delete categories:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Select the `Delete` option to remove the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Adding New Categories

A new category can be added by simply clicking on the "New Page" option within the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Expense Tracking and Budgeting

Each category in the tracker displays a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As expenses are entered, the amounts within the respective categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Users can also set their own budgeted expense amounts for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This allows for [[customizing_budget_templates_in_notion | customizable budgeting]] within the [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | expense tracking system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The overall summary section reflects the total budgeted amount and automatically computes actual expenses, along with the difference and percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

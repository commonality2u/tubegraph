This article outlines how to utilize a [[tracking_debt_repayments_and_progress | debt payment tracker]] to manage and set up various debt repayment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section categorizes debt by different payment frequencies, allowing users to define and manage their repayment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Repayment Categories
Debts are initially divided into categories such as:
*   Annual payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

Other available categories include quarterly and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Debt Details and Schedule Fields
For each debt, the following details help define its repayment schedule:
*   **Loan Amount**: The total amount of the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount**: The amount to be paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The specified interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first date for paying the first installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated field indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: Shows the total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Customizing and Organizing Schedules
*   **Adding New Categories**: Users can add new repayment categories (e.g., "weekly") by clicking the "add a group" button and typing the new installment period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Moving Debts**: Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules (e.g., from monthly to quarterly) by dragging and dropping the debt item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This automatically updates the repayment schedule for that debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction Section" allows for recording individual [[managing_debt_and_loan_repayments | debt payments]] and automatically determines subsequent repayment dates based on the defined schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Recording Paid Installments
*   The "Paid Installment" section reflects all debts that have been paid, organized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   A summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Users can mark an installment as paid or unpaid by clicking a checkmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Capturing Payment Details
When recording a payment:
1.  Enter the **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
2.  Select the **Loan Details** from a list of previously added loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
3.  Input the **EMI Amount** paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Automatic Next Repayment Schedule Calculation
Based on the `payment frequency` set earlier (e.g., monthly, annual), the system automatically calculates and displays the next repayment schedule date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   For a monthly student loan payment made on September 30, the next payment will be scheduled for October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   For an annual home loan payment made on September 27, 2023, the next payment will be scheduled for September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Adding New Debt Payments
Users can quickly add a new debt payment to the schedule by clicking the "pay debt amount" button, which inserts a new entry based on the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Managing Loan Details

### Adding New Debt
To [[setting_up_loan_details_database | add a new debt]], click the "added details" button. It will appear in a "no payment frequency" column, allowing users to then select a specific frequency and fill in the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Editing Existing Loan Details
Existing [[loan_and_repayment_details_management | loan details]] can be edited by clicking on the debt field and typing the desired changes, which will automatically update across all relevant sections of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Integrated Progress Monitoring
All changes and payments automatically update the [[monitoring_debt_payment_and_loan_repayment_progress | debt payoff progress]] section, providing real-time insights into total repaid amount, percentage of total debt paid off, and interest amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Changing an EMI amount, for instance, instantly reflects the updated totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

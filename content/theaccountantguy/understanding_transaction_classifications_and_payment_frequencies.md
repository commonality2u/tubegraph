A small business bookkeeping template utilizes specific features to help manage financial data effectively, including transaction classifications and payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. These settings are configured in the "Start Here" section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Transaction Classification

The template allows for the classification of various accounts within the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. When setting up an item, users have the option to classify it as a bill, debt, or saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. For instance, utility bills can be classified as "bills," and subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This [[categorizing_payments_into_permanent_and_contractual | categorization]] helps in organizing and summarizing financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Payment Frequencies

For payments that occur on a regular schedule, such as monthly, half-yearly, or quarterly, the template includes a "Payment Frequency" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This feature allows users to specify how often a payment is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For example, a credit card payment might be set to a monthly frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Classifications and Frequencies

These classifications and frequencies are instrumental in the "Summary" section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. They feed into dedicated sections, providing clear overviews:

*   **Debt Section**: Reflects all items entered on the liability side, showing debt payments and distinguishing between past and upcoming payments based on their dates and frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Bills Section**: Displays past and upcoming bill payments based on similar principles to the debt section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Subscriptions Section**: Presents a summary of subscriptions, similar to the bills section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

By accurately setting up these classifications and frequencies, the template automatically updates and categorizes transactions, providing a clear financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

The [[features_and_functionalities_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output tool]] allows users to generate [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDF documents]] from Notion databases and templates in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After [[steps_to_set_up_and_export_pdfs_using_pdf_output | exporting]] [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDF documents]], users can manage connections, subscriptions, and various settings within the tool.

## Connections

Once [[steps_to_set_up_and_export_pdfs_using_pdf_output | documents are generated]] and [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_documents | downloaded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, a "connections" option becomes available on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   Clicking on "connections" shows the exact connection that was just created (e.g., "purchase order") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   Selecting this connection automatically loads the previously used database and template in the first step of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   This feature eliminates the need to repeatedly fill in the database and template information for future [[automating_document_exports_using_pdf_output | document exports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Subscriptions

Users on the free plan will notice a "made with [[features_and_functionalities_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output]]" watermark on their [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_documents | exported documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

*   To remove the watermark and any limits on [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDF document generation]], users can click the "upgrade" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Select an available subscription plan and then click "activate subscription" once the payment is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Settings

The "settings" section provides options for configuring the [[features_and_functionalities_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output tool]] behavior:

*   **Page Format:** By default, the page format for correct paging is set to A4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Adding More Resources:** After the initial database and template are added, users can click within the settings to add more databases and templates as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Feedback and Help

[[features_and_functionalities_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output]] provides channels for user support and improvement:

*   **Feedback:** If users encounter difficulties, issues, or have any feedback, they can use the "feedback" option to select a feedback type and send their message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Help:** The "help" section includes a video demonstrating how to [[customizing_templates_for_pdf_generation | use a custom template from scratch]] if users prefer not to use the predefined templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Important Note for Relational Databases

When [[steps_to_set_up_and_export_pdfs_using_pdf_output | setting up]] and connecting databases, especially if using any relation properties in a Notion database:

*   Ensure to give access to that relational database when prompted during the connection process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   When selecting pages for access, choose the main database along with any related databases to ensure all elements are correctly reflected in the [[features_and_functionalities_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

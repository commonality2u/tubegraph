The Notion personal finance tracker allows users to track various aspects of their financial life, including income, expenses, assets, liabilities, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and net worth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The system provides a summary section that shows all finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Tracking Savings Goals

To [[tracking_savings_goals_in_notion | track savings goals]] within the [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | Notion personal finance tracker]], users need to follow a few steps:

### Setting Up Savings Funds

1.  **Navigate to Accounts Section:** Go to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
2.  **Add New Asset:** Savings are considered part of assets, so users need to navigate to the "Assets" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
3.  **Create a New Savings Account:** Click the "New" button to add a new savings fund, such as a "Car Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
4.  **Classify as Savings:** Classify the new account under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. For example, classify "Car Fund" as "Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
5.  **Set a Goal Amount:** Edit the new savings account to specify a "Goal Amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This amount will be reflected under the savings category, and the system will show the total saved amount and the percentage achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Adding Savings Transactions

1.  **Navigate to Transactions Section:** Go to the "Asset" section under the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
2.  **Create a New Transaction:** Click "New" to add a transaction related to savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
3.  **Enter Details:**
    *   Add a description, e.g., "Car Fund Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
    *   Select the relevant savings account, e.g., "Car Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
    *   Choose the payment mode (e.g., Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
    *   Select "Outflow" as the transaction type, because money is moving out of a main account (like a bank account) into the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
    *   Specify the amount being saved (e.g., $100 or $600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

### Viewing Savings Progress

After adding transactions, the savings account in the "Savings" section will update to reflect the amount saved and its percentage of the total goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. For example, if $600 is saved towards a $1200 car fund, it will show as 50% achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Tracking Subscriptions

### Viewing Subscriptions Overview

In the "Summary" section, under the "Subscription" view, users can see:
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Subscriptions with a due date beyond the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. This includes the next expected payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Past Payments:** Subscriptions for which a payment was expected but not yet made within the intermediary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. This helps identify missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Subscription Status:** Users can set and view the active status of a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

*   **Filtering Specific Transactions:** To see all transactions related to a particular account (e.g., a specific savings fund or subscription), click on the account name in the summary view, and a "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom of the right-side window, populating all associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

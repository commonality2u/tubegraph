A credit card expenses tracker can be utilized to set and manage repayment reminders for credit cards, helping users pay their debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Notification Section Overview
The tracker includes a "notification section" which displays the next repayment due date for each added credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. It also indicates the number of days remaining until the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Setting Repayment Dates
Users can set their preferred repayment date for each credit card directly within the notification section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. By clicking on the relevant field, any date of choice can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. As dates are set, the tracker automatically calculates and displays the days left until the next repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

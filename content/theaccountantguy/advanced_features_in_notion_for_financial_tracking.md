He offers a range of Notion templates for financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth in Notion

A core template developed by Sanat Biswal is a net worth tracker, designed to help users monitor their financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This tracker is divided into three main sections:
*   Get Started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

### Setting a Net Worth Goal
In the "Get Started" section, users can specify their desired net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This goal can be easily edited, and the database automatically updates calculations based on the new figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Managing Accounts
The "Account" section allows users to specify different financial accounts for calculating [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Accounts can be classified as expenses, income, assets, or liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Users can add new accounts under each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. When adding an account, details such as the account name, opening balance (relevant for assets and liabilities), classification tags (e.g., bills, subscriptions, savings, debt payments), and payment frequency can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For investments, users can specify opening units and an asset class of "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Existing accounts can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Recording Transactions
The "Transactions" section is where all financial activities are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It offers four distinct views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

When entering a transaction, users specify the date, description, category (income, expense, asset, liability), the associated account, payment mode (e.g., bank account), transaction type (inflow or outflow), and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Receipts or bills can also be attached as documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Income transactions** are inflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Expense transactions** are outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Asset transactions** can be inflow (selling assets) or outflow (purchasing assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Liability transactions** are inflow (obtaining new loans) or outflow (loan repayments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Financial Summary and Net Worth Calculation
The "Summary" section provides an overview of all finances, including expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, showing current standing, closing balances, and the proportion of each account to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The "Net Worth" view within the summary displays key statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:
*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as total assets minus total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between the net worth goal and the current total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The difference between the closing net worth and the opening net worth (based on opening balances of assets and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of the goal has been accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, the net worth automatically updates, allowing for continuous assessment of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

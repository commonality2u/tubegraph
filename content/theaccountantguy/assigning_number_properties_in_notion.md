This article explains how to assign number properties within a Notion database, a foundational step for performing calculations like finding the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Setting Up a Notion Database

To begin, you need to create a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can be done by typing a forward slash (`/`) and then "database" to access a list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The first property in the database is typically a "title" property, which helps signify the purpose of the data being entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Assigning Number Properties

After setting up the basic database, the next crucial step is to [[adding_properties_in_a_notion_database | assign properties]] of "number" to the specific columns that will hold numerical values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These number properties allow you to input and then perform calculations on the numerical data within your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

For example, to find the difference between two numbers, you would assign "number" properties to two distinct columns (e.g., "Number 1" and "Number 2") that will contain the values you wish to calculate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Once number properties are assigned, you can then proceed to [[using_formulas_to_add_numbers_in_notion | use formulas]] to perform operations. For instance, the "subtract operator" or the minus sign (`-`) can be used to find the difference between the numbers in these properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The subtract operator takes two number inputs (e.g., Number 1 and Number 2) to yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

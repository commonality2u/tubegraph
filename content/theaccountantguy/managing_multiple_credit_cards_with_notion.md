*   The total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   The amount that has been repaid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Notification Section
This crucial section helps users [[tracking_debt_payments_using_notion | track debt payments]] by showing:

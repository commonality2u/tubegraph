Wizen is a platform that facilitates the creation of [[ai_content_generation_for_notion | AI-generated content]] directly within a Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers two primary methods for content generation: targeting a Notion page or a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Generating Content on Notion Pages

For a Notion page, which is a simple blank page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the process involves:
1.  **Selection**: Choosing "Notion Page" as the content target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **URL Input**: Copying the specific Notion page URL and pasting it into the Wizen platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
3.  **Content Request**: Providing a prompt, such as "write me a block of 100 words on Notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
Once initiated, Wizen automatically generates and populates the content directly onto the specified Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Generating Content on Notion Databases

Notion databases are structured in rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. To generate [[generating_ai_content_on_notion_pages_and_databases | AI content]] within a Notion database:
1.  **Selection**: Selecting "Notion Database" within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **URL Input**: Copying the URL of the Notion database and pasting it into Wizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
3.  **Content Request**: Defining a request, such as "write me a block of 100 words on the topic," which instructs the AI to generate content for each topic (row) present in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
The platform then populates the content into the respective rows of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, demonstrating its ability to capture every row and generate content accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

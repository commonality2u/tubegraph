Automated notifications can be set up to receive timely reminders for debt payments directly on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These reminders aim to prevent missed payments and help manage finances efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Features of Automated Loan Payment Reminders

The system provides several key features to assist with loan management:

*   **Timely Alerts** Notifications are delivered via WhatsApp on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Detailed Information** Each message includes essential details such as the type of loan, the due date, and the total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For example, a car loan reminder might state it's due on September 23 for $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Integrated Payment Links** Notifications can include a "Pay Now" button or a [[integrating_payment_links_for_loan_repayments | payment link]] that redirects the user to their bank portal or a payment service (e.g., PayPal) to repay the loan instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **[[customizing_and_configuring_loan_repayment_alerts | Customization]]** The messages are fully customizable and can be tailored to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Setting Up Loan Payment Reminders

To receive these debt payment reminders on WhatsApp, a template needs to be created for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:

1.  **Create a New Template** Access the template creation option and input specific loan details, such as the loan type (e.g., car loan) and repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  **Set Repetition** Configure the template to repeat for a specific period. For recurring loans, set the repetition on a [[scheduling_and_repeating_notifications_monthly | monthly basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance, a car loan reminder can be set to repeat every month on the 16th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This ensures the loan entry is automatically added to the database each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **Specify Notification Date** The system allows users to choose when to receive the notification relative to the actual loan due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   To receive a notification seven days before the due date, input "7" in the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For example, if a loan is due on September 23, setting it for "7 days back" will trigger the notification on September 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   To receive the notification on the exact due date, input "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Automation Workflow

Once a recurring template is set up, an automation is triggered each month when the template repeats, sending the debt payment notification message to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

An example demonstrating this automation shows a new loan entry (e.g., an education loan) being automatically populated into the system at a scheduled time (e.g., 3:55 PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Shortly after this entry appears, a payment alert is triggered and sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

This system can be automated for any number of loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Managing Templates

After a loan has been fully repaid, its corresponding template can be deleted to stop further recurring notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Further detailed instructions and relevant information are available in a separate video upon downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

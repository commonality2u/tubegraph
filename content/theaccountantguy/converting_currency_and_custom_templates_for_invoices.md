This article outlines how to track invoice payments using a Notion template and generate professional invoice documents, including options for [[tutorials_for_currency_settings_in_notion | currency conversion]] and [[creating_professional_invoice_templates | custom template creation]].

## Invoice Payment Tracking in Notion

A dedicated Notion template allows for efficient tracking of invoice payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

The template features:
*   **Invoice Payment Summary** A summary at the top provides key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total expenses incurred through invoices, total units purchased from all invoices, and the average invoice price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These KPIs can be customized or updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Client Summary** This section shows purchases, units, and average purchase value for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, specific entries show total purchases and quantities for particular clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Invoice Database** A detailed database at the bottom allows users to fill in comprehensive invoice information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes:
    *   Invoice number, invoice date, and due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Company name (who is ordering/issuing the invoice) and bill-to client address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Description of items purchased, quantity, and unit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   Subtotal (calculated as unit price multiplied by quantity), tax rate, and total computed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Notes, such as expected payment receipt time or mode of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Customizing the Notion Template
To add more items beyond the default two, users can duplicate existing columns and update the formulas accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. All summaries at the top, such as total expenses and units purchased, automatically update when inputs are altered in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Similarly, properties like "total quantities purchased" need formula updates when new quantity columns are added to ensure correct reflection in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Support for direct integration with the Notion database is planned for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Column widths can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
3.  **Generate All** Click "Download all PDF" to generate each PDF document one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. New rows can be added as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
4.  **Generate Single from Bulk** Even in bulk mode, individual PDFs for a specific row can be generated by clicking "Download PDF" on that particular row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

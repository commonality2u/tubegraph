The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users track paycheck payments and manage their budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It features a summary section on the left and an account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Transaction Section

Within the Paycheck Budget Tracker, a dedicated [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction section]] allows users to [[inputting_data_in_the_transactions_tab | add all transactions]] related to every expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once transactions are entered, they reflect in the expense section, displaying the total budgeted amount, expenses incurred, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Quick Actions for Transactions

The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline the [[handling_transactions_and_attaching_invoices | transaction management]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Add Transaction Button:** Clicking the "Add transaction" button automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing the user to then input specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Managing Expense Sources

The system also facilitates [[adding_and_managing_expense_sources | adding and managing expense sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. An "Add expense Source" button automatically adds an expense source under one of the main expense categories (e.g., fixed expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Users can then move this new expense source to be placed under a particular category using the three dots option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Account Section

Under the account section, users can organize their expenses under three primary heads:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to customize these categories by clicking on them, setting their own category names, and clicking "done" for automatic updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, a budgeted amount can be set for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The tracker helps users stay on top of their finances by allowing them to keep track of budgeted payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

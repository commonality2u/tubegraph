The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | track their paycheck payments]] and manage their budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system is divided into two primary sections: the Summary section and the Account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Summary Section
The Summary section, located on the left, provides an overview of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   The percentage of budgeted expense already spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

### Account Section
On the right side is the Account section, where users can set up and manage their expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Expenses can be added under three predefined heads:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

These default categories can be customized by clicking on them, setting a new category name, and clicking "done" for automatic editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Users can also set a budgeted amount for each of these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Transaction Section
Once the expense categories and budgeted amounts are set, users can navigate to the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Here, all individual transactions related to every expense can be [[entering_and_managing_transactions | added]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Information entered into the Transaction section will automatically [[tracking_transactions_and_profit_and_loss | reflect under the expense section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This allows users to view:
*   The total budgeted amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   The expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense already incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

This integration helps users utilize the tracker to monitor their budgeted payments and stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Quick Action Buttons
The tracker also features [[using_quick_action_buttons_for_managing_transactions | quick action buttons]] to streamline data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:

*   **Add Transaction:** Clicking this button automatically adds a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing the user to fill in the specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This simplifies [[entering_transactions_in_notion | entering transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source:** This button automatically adds a new expense category under one of the main heads (Fixed Expense, Variable Expense, or Savings/Investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Users can then reposition this new expense source as needed using the three dots menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

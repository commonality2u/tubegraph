The Investment Portfolio tracker in Notion incorporates [[advanced_features_in_notion_for_financial_tracking | advanced features]] like quick action buttons to streamline the process of managing investments. These buttons allow users to rapidly add new investments or record transactions with minimal manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Add Investment Quick Action

A dedicated "Add Investment" quick action button is available to simplify the process of adding new investment entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Functionality
Clicking this button automatically creates a new investment entry in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Users can then click on a pencil icon to open a new panel where they can input the specific details of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Details to Input
For each new investment, users can add:
*   **Name**: A descriptive name for the investment (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: The initial monetary value of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: The number of units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, which can be specified here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Classification and Categories
Initially, new investments added via the quick action button might be classified under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Users can easily [[organizing_investments_into_groups_such_as_stocks_and_crypto_in_notion | move it]] to existing categories like "stocks" or "crypto" by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Additionally, the tracker allows users to [[setting_up_investment_categories_in_notion | add their own new categories]] by clicking a plus icon and creating a new group, such as "bonds", which will automatically create a new section for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Buy and Sell Investment Quick Actions

The tracker also includes quick action buttons for recording "Buy Investment" and "Sell Investment" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Functionality
*   **Buy Investment**: Clicking this button automatically adds a new entry under the "buy" view of the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It pre-populates the current date, which can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment**: Similarly, this button creates a new line item under the "sell" view, allowing users to quickly record sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Transaction Details
For both buy and sell transactions, users need to fill in:
*   **Date**: The date the transaction occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Type**: The type of transaction (buy or sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Investment Account**: The specific investment (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Units**: The number of units bought or sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Price**: The buy or sell price per unit. The corresponding "amount" (units multiplied by price) is automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

These quick action buttons enhance the efficiency of [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | personal finance tracking]] by simplifying data entry for investments.

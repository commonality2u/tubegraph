[[notion_dashboard_for_freelancers | Notion Freelancers OS]] is a comprehensive dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their entire business, encompassing finance and client relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This setup allows users to track income and expenses, and effectively manage clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Getting Started

Upon downloading the setup, users land on a main page featuring quick instructions, including a video demonstration on how to change currency settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A quick tutorial also explains how to use the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The dashboard has two main navigation windows: Finance and Client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Finance Section

The Finance section allows freelancers to track all their income and expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Finance

*   **Tutorial Video:** A dedicated video tutorial is available for users unfamiliar with the finance system, explaining its full usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Income Classification:** Any income related to a client can be classified as "client" income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Users can also create their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Automatic Reflection:** All income transactions booked and classified under "client" in the Finance section will automatically reflect in the Client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This ensures accurate [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | tracking income and expenses effectively]] and [[utilizing_notion_for_financial_summaries_and_budgeting | financial summaries and budgeting]] within Notion.

## Client Management Section

The Client section is a comprehensive portal for managing client interactions, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It includes four main areas: Invoicing Details, Client Details, Project Details, and Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Client Details

The client management system organizes clients into three pipelines:
*   **Lead:** For potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Negotiation:** For clients in the negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Client:** For current clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Users can easily add new clients and specify details such as client name, company, contact information, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The system automatically calculates the total invoice amount raised against each client based on fed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Contract value can also be manually entered and will update with invoice amounts over time, showing a percentage of work invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Clients can be easily moved between different pipeline stages via drag-and-drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Project Details

This section allows for [[projects_and_services_management_for_freelancers | projects and services management for freelancers]], helping to track all ongoing projects related to client contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects can be categorized by priority: Low, Medium, or High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

*   **Adding Projects:** Users can add new projects by specifying a name, project value, and a completion date range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Status Tracking:** Project status can be updated (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Completion Calculation:** Project completion can be calculated in two ways:
    *   **Hourly Basis:** By specifying estimated hours and then booking actual hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **Invoicing Basis:** Based on the total project value and the invoices assigned to that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For example, if a $6,000 project has $3,000 invoiced, it shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Services Offered

The Services section lists the services offered to clients, categorized by their status: Not Started, In Progress, or Completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

*   **Service Details:** For each service, users can specify the name, pricing (hourly or fixed flat rate), and service duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. These options are customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Linking to Clients and Projects:** Each service can be linked to a specific client and project, displaying relevant income and service values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Invoicing Details

The Invoicing section tracks the status of invoices: Draft, Sent, or Paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

*   **Invoice Management:** Users can add new invoices, assign invoice numbers, and set due dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates:** The total invoice amount is automatically reflected from the workflow section at the bottom of the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. As details are added in the workflow, the invoicing section updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode:** Users can indicate when payment has been received by setting the payment mode (e.g., "Bank"), which impacts financial calculations in the Finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

### Workflow Integration

The "Workflow" section at the bottom of the Client dashboard is crucial as it carries forward income details from the Finance section, filtered specifically for client income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Here, users can link incomes to specific invoices, clients, projects, and services, streamlining data flow across the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. New invoices, clients, projects, or services can also be created directly from this workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## Tools Section

Beyond finance and client management, the dashboard offers a "Tools" section to further assist freelancers.

### Resources View

This section is a curated collection of highly useful resources, categorized into Checklists, Guides, Strategies, and Tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Users can add new resources, assign categories (e.g., Taxes, Budgeting), and include links and notes with features like to-do lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

### Contacts Section

The Contacts section allows users to maintain a catalog of all relevant contacts, categorized by the services they provide (e.g., Finance, Legal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Users can add contact details, designation, phone number, address, email ID, and company name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Custom categories for contacts can also be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Goals Section

This feature helps users set and track personal or business goals, classified under categories like Health, Wealth, and Relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Goals can have a target number and a progress number, which automatically calculates a completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

### Calendar View

The Calendar view displays all scheduled meetings for the month, providing a quick glance at business commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

*   **Meeting Scheduling:** Users can add new meetings by specifying a title, agenda, and assigning attendees (clients or contacts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
*   **Meeting Medium:** The medium of the meeting (e.g., Google Meet, Skype) can be selected or customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Attachments and Priority:** Reference documents can be attached, and meetings can be assigned a priority (low, medium, high) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **View Customization:** The calendar view can be switched between monthly and weekly views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.

## Customization and Future Enhancements

All sections, including clients, projects, services, and invoicing, are customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The creator plans to add more features in future updates, including inventory, supplier, and vendor management for more comprehensive business tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

The Notion Formula Chatbot allows users to select and utilize different GPT models for generating Notion formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Before selecting a model, an [[generating_and_using_an_openai_api_key | OpenAI API key]] must be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Available GPT Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

The chatbot provides two primary GPT models for user selection:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>
*   **GPT 4106 Preview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

## Model Comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

There are notable differences between the available models:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: This is an older model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> and is generally less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> compared to GPT 4106. It is accessible for users on a free OpenAI account, which typically comes with a $5 free credit for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The demonstration in the video was conducted using GPT 3.5 Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4106 Preview**: This model offers better and more accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> for prompts and questions. It is recommended for users who are on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## How to Select a GPT Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

After placing your [[generating_and_using_an_openai_api_key | OpenAI API key]] in the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, you can select your preferred GPT model from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This option is located on the left side of the chatbot interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the left panel is not visible, click the arrow on the left side of the window to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

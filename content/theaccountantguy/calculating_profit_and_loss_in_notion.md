The Notion Investment Portfolio tracker is designed to help users monitor their investments and calculate associated profits and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Overview of Profit and Loss Sections

The tracker features dedicated areas to display profit and loss information:
*   **Portfolio Section** This section reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A "Profit Loss" section is available, showing the total profit and loss for each investment post-transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Each individual investment displays a profit or loss figure on its right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Total Summation** On top of the portfolio section, there's a summation of profit or loss for each category (e.g., stocks, cryptos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Transactions and Profit/Loss View

The "Transactions" section allows users to record all investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This section has various views, including a specific "Profit and Loss" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

When using the "Profit and Loss" view within the transactions, users can see the profit or loss generated from every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This view provides additional information, specifically the "Buy price," which is crucial for calculating the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Calculation Method
The profit or loss for a transaction is determined by comparing the selling price to the buying price of the units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

For example:
*   If 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each (total sales value $1,200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, and those same 30 units were initially bought for $10 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, the profit per unit is $30 ($40 - $10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Multiplying the $30 profit per unit by the 30 units sold results in a generated profit of $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Adding Transactions for Calculation
Users can add "Buy" and "Sell" transactions via quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Buy Investment:** Clicking "Buy Investment" automatically adds a new entry under the buy view, picking the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Users can input the buy price, and the system automatically calculates the buy amount (units multiplied by price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment:** Similarly, clicking "Sell Investment" creates a new entry under the sell view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Users input the selling price, and the system calculates the sales amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

These entries then feed into the profit and loss calculations displayed in the respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The emergency fund tracking template features a "Fund Setup" section designed to help users organize their savings by various categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Default Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
Upon navigating to the "Fund Setup," three default categories are provided:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## Managing Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

### Editing Existing Categories
Users can [[renaming_and_managing_categories | edit existing categories]] by clicking on them to define their own custom category names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding New Categories
To add a new category, simply click on the "add a group" button, which prompts the user to add an entirely new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This feature allows for [[renaming_and_managing_categories | expanding categories]] beyond the default options.

### Adding and Classifying New Funds
When a new fund is added by clicking the "add fund" button, it initially appears under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. To classify it, click the three-dot menu next to the fund and move it to the desired category, such as "Financial Safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Editing Fund Details
For each fund, users can click a pencil icon to:
*   Add fund details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Specify a starting balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Define a goal amount for targeted savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Set a start date for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Set a target end date for the fund to be fully available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

The names of any emergency fund can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Savings Overview Categorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
The "Savings Overview" section also organizes savings into these three different classifications, providing a structured view of all emergency funds under their respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Ultimately, the entire template, including its categorization, can be customized to suit individual needs and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The emergency fund tracking template provided includes a "Fund Setup" section which allows users to organize their emergency savings into different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This flexibility allows for a personalized approach to [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | setting up emergency funds]] and [[customizing_notion_for_personal_finance_management | customizing Notion for personal finance management]].

## Default Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

Upon initial setup, the template provides three default categories for emergency funds:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## Managing Categories

Users have the ability to customize these categories to better suit their individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Editing Existing Categories
To edit an existing category, click on it and define a new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This process is similar to [[customizing_categories_and_filters_in_notion | customizing categories and filters in Notion]].

### Adding New Categories
If additional categories are needed, a new group can be added by clicking "add a group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Assigning Funds to Categories
When a new fund is added to the template, it initially appears under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. To classify it, click on the three-dot menu next to the new fund and move it to the desired category, such as "financial safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The ability to customize categories for emergency funds allows for greater flexibility and personalization in managing financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

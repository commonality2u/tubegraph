The demonstrated template helps users track [[inventory_tracking_for_small_businesses | inventory for small businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The overall "Inventory portfolio" section contains three main views: "Inventory setup," "Inventory portfolio," and "Inventory status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Inventory Setup Section

This section is where inventory items are defined and their initial parameters are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Inventory Classifications

Inventory is organized into three primary classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   **Raw Materials:** Unprocessed items used in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Work in Progress (WIP):** Partially completed goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Finished Goods:** Completed products ready for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Inventory Item Details

For each inventory item added, several key details are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:

*   **Opening Balance:** The starting monetary value of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units:** The initial quantity of units on hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle:** Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WSC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If these principles are unfamiliar, they can be left as is without affecting reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level:** This specifies the number of units at which the inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn, 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This level is crucial for the "Inventory portfolio" view to indicate [[inventory_value_and_reorder_status | low stock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** This indicates the proportion of a specific inventory item compared to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Adding New Inventory

New inventory items can be added using an "add inventory" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. When added, they initially appear in a "no classification window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Users can then move these items to their appropriate category (e.g., "work in progress") by dragging them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. After categorization, the details for the new item can be entered using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

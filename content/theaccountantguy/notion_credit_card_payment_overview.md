This article provides an overview of a [[notion | Notion]]-based credit card expenses tracker designed to help users manage their credit card payments and expenses efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tracker allows users to keep track of all credit card payments, monitor due amounts, and manage their budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Overview Sections

The tracker is organized into several key overview sections:

### Credit Cards Overview
This section displays all added credit cards, showing the total amount due, the amount repaid, and the remaining balance for each card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Examples include "Student Credit Card," "Cash Back Credit Card," "Travel Credit Card," and "Rewards Credit Card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Monthly Overview
A monthly summary shows the amount due, repaid, and balance due for each month, which can be customized as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly view, this section provides a yearly summary of the total amount due, repaid, and balance due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Expense Detail Section
This section lists all expenses that have been added in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is where users input their expense data (discussed further below) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Expenses Overview
This section provides a categorized overview of all booked expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It displays the total expenses, the budgeted amount for each category, and indicates whether the budget is "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Notification Section
This feature shows the next repayment due date and the number of days remaining until that date for each added credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This helps users pay credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Using the [[credit_card_expense_tracking_in_notion | Credit Card Expense Tracking in Notion]]

*   **Category:** An assigned category for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. New categories can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Managing Budgets
In the **Expenses Overview** section, users can set a budgeted amount for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The tracker will then compare incurred expenses to the budget and display "under budget" if expenses are within the limit or "over budget" if they exceed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Setting Repayment Dates
Users can manually set their repayment dates in the **Notification Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The tracker will then show how many days are pending until the next repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Additional Views and Customization

The tracker offers various ways to view and manage data:

*   **Summarization by Period:** Clicking on a period opens a new window showing transaction details (date, period, detail, amount) with a tag indicating if it's a repayment (green) or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Summarization by Year:** Similar detailed transaction information is available for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Summarization by Credit Card:** Clicking on a specific credit card displays all transactions related to it, including a status and category for the card itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Summarization by Category:** Selecting a category shows all expenses associated with it, along with relevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Credit card information and categories can be edited or added by clicking the pencil icon or "new" button in their respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 
The "Accountant Guy" demonstrates a travel expense tracker designed to [[tracking_travelrelated_expenses_including_transportation_and_lodging | track travel-related expenses]] and facilitate planning ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tracker is organized into summary sections for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Expense Categorization System

The tracker utilizes a system for [[creating_an_expense_categories_system | creating an expense categories system]] to [[organizing_funds_into_categories_for_financial_management | organize funds into categories]] for financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Setting Up Categories and Budgeting

In the "Accounts" view, expenses are initially classified under three main categories:
*   Travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

Any expenses incurred are recorded under one of these [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

To [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | set up expense categories and budgets]]:
*   **Adding an Expense Source (Sub-category)**: A new expense source can be quickly added to an existing travel category by clicking an "add expense source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Once added, it can be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: An expense source can be edited by clicking a pencil icon to change its name (e.g., to "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amount**: A budgeted amount can be set for each expense source, such as $1,500 for "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Moving Expense Sources**: An expense source can be moved to a different main category, such as moving a newly added source to the "Meals" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Adding New Main Categories**: Users can create entirely new groups (main categories) separate from existing ones like Travel, Meals, and Lodging by clicking a plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: Existing main groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Tracking Expenses Against Budget

The "Expenses" section provides an overview of:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Budgeted expense set for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Percentage of what has been spent relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

<mark style="background: #BBFCAFA;">**Visual Indicators**</mark>
*   Expenses exceeding the budget are indicated in red, for example, a $2,000 flight expense against a $1,000 budget shows as 200% over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Expenses within the budgeted amount are shown in green, such as a $100 breakfast expense against a $300 budget, reflecting 33% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

This [[income_and_expense_categorization_and_analysis | categorization and analysis]] provides a quick view of expense standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

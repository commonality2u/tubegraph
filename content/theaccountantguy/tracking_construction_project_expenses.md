This article details a Notion template designed to [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | track business expenses]] specifically for construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The template offers a streamlined way to manage finances by categorizing expenses, comparing budgeted amounts to actual spending, and providing a summary of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is structured with different expense categories prominently displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, it shows:
*   A budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This allows for real-time updates as values are modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Managing Expenses and Categories

The template provides easy methods for managing both expense data and categories:

### Modifying Expenses
Users can modify expense values in the table at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Changing these values will dynamically update the corresponding actual expenses for each category at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Managing Categories
*   **Editing a Category:** Click on the pencil icon next to a category to edit its definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Adding a Category:** Click on "new page" to add a new expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting a Category:** Click on the three-dot icon next to a category and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Adjusting Budgeted Expenses
The budgeted expense amount for any category can be easily defined or updated by simply clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Summary Section

A dedicated summary section provides a quick overview of the project's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses pulled from the bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

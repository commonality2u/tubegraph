This Notion template provides a comprehensive dashboard for tracking employee training and associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers two main views: a training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. All information within the tracker is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The dashboard presents key information at a glance, providing insights into training attendance and costs. This can be considered a specialized application of [[using_notion_for_business_tracking|Using Notion for business tracking]].

### Training Overview

This section offers a summary of all scheduled trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each individual training, you can see:
*   The training date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   The count of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The percentage of attendance, indicating how many employees have completed the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The training expense incurred for each training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Employee Records

This section lists employees organized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   You can edit existing department names directly by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   New departments can be added by dragging a slider to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Employees can be easily moved between departments by dragging and dropping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> or by using the three-dot menu to select a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   For each employee, the system displays the total number of trainings they have attended out of their assigned trainings (e.g., "2 out of 3 trainings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   A percentage of attendance for each employee is also shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   You can specify the "next training date" for an employee by clicking on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and the system will automatically calculate the number of days remaining until that date from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This feature can assist with [[using_notion_for_employee_scheduling|employee scheduling]].

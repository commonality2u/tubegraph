An [[using_employee_schedule_templates | employee schedule template]] can be utilized to keep track of the schedules, tasks, and performance of employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template typically includes several key views:

*   **[[managing_employee_details_and_departments | Employee Details]]**: Lists information for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule**: Helps in entering all tasks for employees across different dates and shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Monthly View**: Shows aggregated hours worked or on leave, divided by months and quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **[[monitoring_employee_performance_and_hours | Employee Performance]]**: Provides specific [[monitoring_employee_performance_and_hours | performance information]] broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Employee Details Management

The [[managing_employee_details_and_departments | Employee Details]] section is where new employees are added and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Adding New Employees**: Click "New" to add an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A quick action button "Add Employee" can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Categories/Departments**: Employees can be categorized into departments like operations, marketing, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. New categories can be added using a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and existing ones can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Employee Information**: Details to be entered include:
    *   Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Employee ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
    *   Contact Information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
    *   Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   Position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
    *   Email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

## Task Schedule Management

After employees are added in the [[managing_employee_details_and_departments | Employee Details]] section, the Task Schedule is used for entering task-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This section helps in [[setting_up_employee_schedules_in_notion | setting up employee schedules]] by dividing tasks into different shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Shifts and Task Entry
Tasks can be organized into shifts such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For each task, employees can enter:
*   **Start Time**: Desired date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **End Time**: Indicates the period for the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Task Detail**: Specific information about the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Employee Name**: Selected from the employees added earlier, or new employees can be added directly from here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Department**: Automatically assigned based on the [[managing_employee_details_and_departments | employee details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Hours Worked**: Automatically computed based on the start and end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Attendance and Task Status
*   **[[tracking_and_updating_attendance_and_training_dates | Attendance]]**: Employees can mark their attendance as present, on leave, or day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Task Status**: The status of a task can be updated to:
    *   In progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
    *   Completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   Not started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
    *   Not applicable (e.g., if on leave or day off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

## Monthly View for Performance Overview

The Monthly View provides an aggregated overview of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Breakdown**: Months are divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hour Tracking**: It displays the total hours worked for a specific month, total hours on leave, and the overall total hours (summation of worked and leave hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This provides a quick overview of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## [[monitoring_employee_performance_and_hours | Employee Performance]] Section

For a detailed individual performance breakdown, the [[monitoring_employee_performance_and_hours | Employee Performance]] section shows the same information as the monthly view but on an employee-specific basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This allows for seeing the hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for each employee individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This template helps in [[setting_up_employee_schedules_in_notion | setting up employee schedules]] and [[monitoring_employee_performance_and_hours | monitoring employee performance and hours]] by keeping track of employee work and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

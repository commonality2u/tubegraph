A [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | Notion debt tracker]] is a tool designed to help users monitor debt payments, manage them effectively, and work towards becoming debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This minimalistic tracker is built using five distinct databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Tracker Sections Overview

The tracker is organized into several key sections:

### Summary Section
This section provides a high-level overview of all debts, displaying the total loan amount, total amount repaid, total interest repaid, and the repayment in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This section is linked to the "Total Debt" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Debt Overview
Under this section, specific categories of debt are listed, including student loans, credit cards, car loans, personal loans, home loans, and other loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For each category, it shows the total loan amount, total amount repaid, total interest repaid, repayment in percentage, and the estimated date of becoming debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This section is linked to the "Summary of Debt" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Debt Progressive Payments
This section outlines future progressive due payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It displays the month of payment, the amount due, and the payment status (paid or not paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Clicking a checkbox updates the payment status, and entering the payment amount updates progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Once an amount is paid, it updates the corresponding "debt overview" section with the amount repaid, interest repaid, and repayment percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This section is linked to the "Loan Details" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Essential Databases

To build this [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | Notion debt tracker]], five databases are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:

### 1. Debt Database
This database holds all debt-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Properties**:
    *   **Name**: Default property, lists debt types (e.g., student loan, credit card, car loan, personal loan, home loan, other loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   **Loan Amount**: Total loan amount, a number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   **Interest Rate**: Annual interest rate, a number property displayed in percentage format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Payment**: Minimum monthly repayment amount, a number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   **Additional Repayment**: Amount paid during the first installment (e.g., down payment), a number property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   **Initial Repayment Date**: Date of the first installment payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   **Interest Rate Per Month**: Calculated by dividing the interest rate by 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   **Debt Free Period**: A formula property calculating the debt-free period in months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

This article details how to track personal finances, including [[budgeting_and_saving_strategically_with_notion | budgeting and saving strategically]], using a Notion setup, as presented by The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This template is designed for individuals but can also be adapted for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

## Core Components of the Notion Finance Tracker

The Notion finance tracker includes several key sections to help manage personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
*   **Net Worth Target** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Accounts** (Income, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Budget** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   **Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   **Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Net Worth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   **Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

## Setting Up Accounts

The first step in [[using_notion_for_personal_finance | using Notion for personal finance]] is to navigate to the "Account section" under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Income and Expenses
Here, you can find and modify existing income and expense accounts (e.g., salary, side hustle, groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. New accounts can be added by clicking the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Each expense can be classified (e.g., Bills, Savings, Subscription, Debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. A payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) can also be set for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. When creating a new account, you can specify its name, an opening balance (not applicable for income/expense accounts), classification, and payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Assets and Liabilities
Under the "Liabilities" part of the "Account" section, you can add and manage debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. New debts can be added with a name, opening balance, "Debt" classification, and payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

[[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | Creating a savings funds tracker in Notion]] involves navigating to the "Asset" part of the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Savings funds are classified as "Savings" and can have a specific goal amount set for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

Once accounts are set up, transactions are entered in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This section offers five views: "All" (for all transaction types), and specific views for Income, Expenses, Assets, and Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

To add a new transaction:
1.  Navigate to the relevant section (e.g., Income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
3.  Select the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month, with later months appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
5.  Select the account (e.g., Salary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
6.  Choose the payment mode (e.g., Bank, Cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
7.  Specify the transaction type: "Inflow" if money is coming into your account, or "Outflow" if money is leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
8.  Enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

For debt payments, you typically use the "Outflow" transaction type from your bank account to repay the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. If you obtain a new loan, it would be an "Inflow" transaction to your loan account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

For [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | creating a savings funds tracker in Notion]], transactions are entered under the "Asset" section as an "Outflow" from your main account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

You can view all transactions related to a specific account (e.g., Salary) by clicking on the account in the summary view and selecting "View Transactions" at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Tracking Finances with Notion

The "Summary" section provides an overview of your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Finances Overview
The "Finances" view under "Summary" displays all income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, along with their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It shows the total amount of income earned and total expenses incurred, with percentages for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Changes in transaction amounts are immediately reflected here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Debt Tracking
The "Debt" view under "Summary" shows upcoming and past debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Debts due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Past Payments:** Debts where the last payment was made in the past, indicating a potential missed payment if it falls within the expected frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
Each debt also displays the total loan amount, repayment percentage, and amount paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Budgeting
The "Budget" section under "Summary" allows you to set estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It reflects incurred expenses and income as a percentage of the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Budgeted amounts can be easily changed, and the percentages will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Savings Tracking
The "Savings" section under "Summary" allows you to track all your savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It displays the goal amount, the total amount saved so far, and the savings in percentage towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This is useful for [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | creating a savings funds tracker in Notion]] and [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | setting up emergency funds using Notion]].

### Bill Management
The "Bills" section under "Summary" tracks upcoming and past bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Similar to debt tracking, it helps identify if a payment has been missed based on the last payment date and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

### Subscription Tracking
The "Subscription" section under "Summary" works similarly to bills and debt, showing upcoming and past subscription payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It also displays the subscription status (e.g., active) and the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Net Worth Calculation
The "Net Worth Goal" section allows you to set a target net worth for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The "Net Worth" view under "Summary" provides an overview of your current net worth (assets minus liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. It also shows the difference you are lagging behind your goal and the percentage of the net worth goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. A "Total Growth" section shows the increase from your opening net worth (opening assets less opening liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

## General Information

### Availability

### Cost
Notion is a free tool to use; you only need to sign up with an existing email ID. There are no extra charges involved beyond the template's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. Notion does offer paid plans with additional features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Couples' Finance Tracking
For couples, the dashboard is equally applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Under the "Account" section, individuals can split different categories of accounts by labeling them (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") to denote earnings or expenses by each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. This allows for individual tracking within the shared system.

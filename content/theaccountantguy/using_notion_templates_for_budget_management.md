[[Using Notion for financial management | Notion templates]] can be effectively used for managing restaurant operations business expenses, offering a structured way to track and categorize financial outgoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Template Overview
The specialized template for restaurant operations budget management features three distinct categories of expenses at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, there is a designated section for budgeted expenses and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Expense Tracking Features
*   **Budget Definition** The budgeted expense for any category can be easily defined or modified by clicking on its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Percentage Indicator** A percentage indicator provides a quick visual of how much actual expense has been incurred relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Updates** All expense values and summary figures update dynamically as new figures are entered into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Managing Categories
The template allows for flexible management of expense categories:
*   **Modifying Categories** Existing categories can be modified by clicking on the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories** New expense categories can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories** Categories can also be deleted by clicking on the three-dot icon and selecting the delete option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Summary Section
A summary section provides a comprehensive financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section includes:
*   The total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

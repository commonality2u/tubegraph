The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker includes a dedicated **Quarterly Summary** section, providing a consolidated overview of financial activity across different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This feature offers a quick snapshot of overall receivables and payables, helping to monitor business financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Overview of the Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>

The quarterly summary is a compilation of all transactions grouped by quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For each quarter, the summary displays:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

This information is calculated from all transactions entered into the [[using_summary_and_transaction_sections_for_balances | transaction section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The total amount for all quarters combined is also reflected at the top of the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example: Third Quarter Summary
> As an illustration, the third quarter's summary might show a total receivable of $1150 (derived from individual invoices like $150 + $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. If the total payable for the same quarter is $250, the net balance would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This provides a clear [[monthly_and_quarterly_contribution_breakdown | quarterly contribution breakdown]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Accessing and Utilizing Quarterly Data
Within the [[using_summary_and_transaction_sections_for_balances | transaction section]], users can select specific periods, which are organized into four distinct quarters, to categorize their entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. To view a specific quarter's summary, users can slide the slider to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker | Customer Payments Tracker]] is a template designed to help users [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | keep track of all customer payments]] in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Template Sections

The template is divided into different sections to manage payment information effectively:

### Summary Section

Located on the left side, the summary section provides a quick overview of payment financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It displays:
*   The total amount of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The payment amount that has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The difference between the due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Right-Side Sections

On the right side, there are three distinct sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
1.  Customer section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
2.  Overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
3.  Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

#### Customer Section

This section allows users to set up their entire [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is subdivided into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Users can edit existing sections by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> or add new subsections using the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Under each subsection, individual customers are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For every customer, the total payment amount due is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This amount can be changed by clicking on it and entering a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Customer names can also be edited using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. New customers can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and existing customers can be deleted by clicking on the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

#### Overview Section

Once the customer database and due payment amounts are set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, the overview section provides a summary of received payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows the total payment received, the total payment due, and the percentage of payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

#### Transaction Section

The [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction section]] is where payment details are entered, which in turn updates the overview figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For each transaction, users can enter:
*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   The customer name, chosen from a dropdown list of all customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A document section to attach specific [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | invoices]] related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

As these details are filled, the received payment amount in the overview section automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The sales performance OS template provides a comprehensive way to manage sales data, specifically tracking performance by various sales channels and geographical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This system allows for detailed [[sales_performance_tracking | sales performance tracking]] and analysis, offering insights into where sales are generated and to whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Overview
The main sales dashboard features three key [[sales_dashboard_components | components]]: salesperson performance, sales channel performance, and sales location performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. All three components are organized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Filters can be applied to view data for specific months or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Tracking by Sales Channel
The "Sales Channel" component indicates the different sources from which sales have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Examples include website, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Users can add their own custom categories for sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

For each sales channel, the following statistics are displayed:
*   Sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Targeted sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Percentage of targeted sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Status (e.g., "Target achieved" or "Target not achieved") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

A "Sales Channel overview" on the left panel provides total sales, sales units, and average sales for each channel across the entire time period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Tracking by Sales Location
The "Sales Location" component shows where sales have been made geographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Similar to sales channels, it displays achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage achieved, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The "Sales Location overview" on the left panel details the total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This helps in tracking and providing an overview of business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Managing Sales Transactions
Sales transactions are entered in a dedicated section, mirroring the dashboard's structure by including fields for salesperson, sales channel, and sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

For sales channels, users need to input:
*   Sales Channel information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   A unique referral code (sales channel code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   Month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   Sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

For sales locations, the required inputs are:
*   A unique location tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Location name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

Once details are entered in the salesperson window, the specific channel, referral code, and target automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Account details for each sales channel and location also need to be fed as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Setting Sales Targets and Codes
The system allows for [[customizing_sales_targets_and_codes | customizing sales targets and codes]] for both sales channels and locations.

### Sales Channel Targets
At the start of each month, users can assign a targeted sales amount for each individual sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This is done through a "quick action button" on the left panel labeled "sales target," which automatically assigns a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Users can specify the referral target that they aim to achieve for each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Sales Location Targets
Similarly, a targeted sales amount can be specified for each individual location at the beginning of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. A unique "location tag" is used, relevant to the location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The target can be specified, and then the actual sale amount is entered as sales proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Sales Codes
For each individual view (person, channel, location), a specific code must be assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This is part of the process for [[customizing_sales_targets_and_codes | customizing sales targets and codes]].

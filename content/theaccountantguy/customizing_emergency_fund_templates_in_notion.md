This article explains how to customize an [[customizing_notion_dashboard_for_personal_finances | Notion]] template designed to track [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes sections for fund setup, savings overview, and a summary of savings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Fund Setup Customization

The "Fund Setup" section is where you define and organize your [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Managing Categories

You can customize the [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] for your [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency funds]]:
*   **Default Categories** The template initially provides three [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]]: "Financial Safety," "Asset Protection," and "Health and Wellness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Edit Existing Categories** You can rename or define your own [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | categories]] by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Add New Categories** To add a completely new category (group), simply click the "Add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Adding and Configuring Funds

To add a new fund:
1.  Click the "Add fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This will automatically add a new fund item under a "No classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  Move the new fund to its respective category by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting the desired category (e.g., "Financial Safety") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon next to the fund to [[editing_and_managing_savings_in_notion | edit]] its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

You can customize the following for each fund:
*   **Fund Detail** Add a specific description for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance** Define the initial opening balance for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount** Specify your targeted savings amount for this [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date** Select the date when you plan to begin contributing to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date** Set the date by which you aim to reach your total goal amount for this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

You can also [[editing_and_managing_savings_in_notion | edit]] the names of any [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency fund]] at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Contribution Tracking Customization

The "Contribution" section allows you to record your monthly savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Recording Contributions

For each contribution, you can customize:
*   **Date** The specific date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description** A brief detail about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period** While months for 2023 are predefined, you can add new months for any year (e.g., "March 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Fund** Select the specific fund to which the contribution is being made from the list of funds you've set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount** Enter the amount of money you are contributing for the specific month towards that fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Using Quick Action Button

It is recommended to use the "Quick action" button to add new contribution entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This button automatically adds a new line item for the current month and date, simplifying the entry process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. You can then fill in the details or select a different date if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Overview and Summary

The template automatically calculates and displays various metrics based on your custom inputs:
*   **Quarterly Overview** Provides a glance view of all months in each quarter, showing total savings and required contributions for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

*   **Savings Overview** Displays total savings made so far for each [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | emergency fund]], targeted savings, percentage achieved, targeted savings date, and months remaining until the target end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. It also shows the monthly contribution required to meet the targeted fund by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Presents the total savings made (sum of opening balances and contributions), total savings required (sum of all targeted savings amounts), and the difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It also shows the percentage of targeted savings achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

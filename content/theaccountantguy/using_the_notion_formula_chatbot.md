The Notion Formula Chatbot is a tool designed to assist [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion]] users who find it challenging to obtain the correct [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This chatbot helps users derive the exact [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | formula]] they need for [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Getting Started

Before interacting with the chatbot, users must place their OpenAI API key and select a GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Generating an OpenAI API Key

To use the chatbot, you need to generate an OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>:
1.  Click the question mark icon within the chatbot interface to find the link for generating an OpenAI key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  This link redirects you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
3.  On the OpenAI platform, locate and click "API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
5.  Fill in the details (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
6.  A new key will be generated. Copy this key immediately, as it cannot be viewed again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
7.  Paste this key into the designated field in the chatbot window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A message confirming the API key has been entered will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

When creating an OpenAI account, users typically receive a $5 free credit, which can be used for testing with the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Selecting a GPT Model

After entering the API key, you need to select a GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The chatbot offers two models via a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo:** An older model that is less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This model is suitable for free accounts using the $5 credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **GPT 4-106 Preview:** A newer model that provides better and more accurate results, recommended for users under a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The demonstrations in the video were performed using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Interacting with the Chatbot

The chatbot interface is divided into three sections: Info, Chat, and Give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Interaction with the chatbot primarily happens in the Chat section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Examples of Formula Queries

The chatbot can provide [[creating_formulas_for_common_notion_tasks | Notion formulas]] for various tasks:

*   **Adding Two Numbers:**
    *   **Question:** "What is the [[formulas_for_finding_the_sum_of_numbers_in_notion | formula]] to add two numbers in Notion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   **Response:** The chatbot instantly suggests using `property A + property B`, where Property A and B represent the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Finding Time Difference Between Dates:**
    *   **Question:** "What is the [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | formula]] to find the difference between the birth date and today's date in years in Notion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
    *   **Response:** The chatbot recommends using the `dateBetween` [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | formula]] and specifying 'years' as the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Using IF Conditions:**
    *   **Question:** "If number one is greater than number two, I want to generate number one as the output, otherwise I want to generate number two as the output." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
    *   **Response:** The chatbot accurately provides the [[creating_custom_formulas_in_notion | formula]] using an `if` condition: `if(numberOne > numberTwo, numberOne, numberTwo)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The chatbot responds instantly with explanations, identifying necessary components for the [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Sometimes, better prompting, including examples or references, may be needed for optimal responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Additional Features

### Image Option

Users can upload an image, which will then appear as their display icon for the user in the chat interface. This is an optional feature for a personalized interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Clicking a cross icon will revert the user image to the original default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

A Notion template designed for small businesses allows users to effectively manage their inventory by setting reorder levels and receiving stock warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This feature helps ensure that inventory levels remain adequate and prevents stockouts.

## Setting Reorder Levels

Within the [[setting_up_inventory_categories | Inventory Setup]] section of the inventory portfolio, you can define a "reorder level" for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Definition**: The reorder level represents the minimum number of units you wish to have before needing to reorder a particular inventory item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Example**: For "wheat," a reorder level of 60 units is set, while for "corn," it's 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Monitoring Stock Status and Reorder Warnings

The "Inventory Portfolio" view provides an overview of your current stock and indicates when reordering is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Current Inventory**: This section displays the number of units available for each inventory item after all purchases and sales transactions have been recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level**: This crucial feature provides messages based on your defined reorder levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   **Low Stock Warning**: If the available units of an inventory item drop below its set reorder level, the system will display a "low stock" message, indicating that a reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
        *   **Example (Wheat)**: If the reorder level for wheat is 60 units and only 30 units are available, the system will signal "low stock" because 30 is below 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Surplus Stock Notification**: If the available units are significantly above the reorder level, the system will notify that the item is available in "Surplus" and does not require immediate reordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
        *   **Example (Corn)**: With a reorder level of 10 units for corn, if 70 units are available, the system indicates that the item is in surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

This system allows for a quick glance at all inventory categories, helping to identify items with sufficient units or those requiring replenishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The template also supports [[tracking_inventory_status_and_transactions | tracking inventory status and transactions]] and [[tracking_investments_and_inventory_values | tracking inventory values]] overall.

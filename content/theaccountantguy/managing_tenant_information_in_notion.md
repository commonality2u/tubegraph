This Notion template is designed to help users track house rental payments and manage tenant information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Core Features

### Adding and Classifying Tenants
The template allows for the addition of basic tenant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tenants can be classified under different property types that you own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Examples of pre-defined classifications include "apartment" and "duplex," but users can add any other property types as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

To add a new tenant:
1.  Click the "Add tenant" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This automatically creates a new tenant entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  Click the three-dot icon next to the new entry and drag it to place it under its respective property category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon to add detailed information for the tenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Property and Tenant Overview
The "Property" section provides a categorized view of your properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Underneath each property classification, you can see the name of the tenant associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

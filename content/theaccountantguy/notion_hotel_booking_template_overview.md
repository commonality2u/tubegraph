This Notion template is designed for tracking hotel bookings, offering a simple interface to manage guest information and key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, two main KPIs provide an overview of booking data:

*   **Bookings by Room Type** This section displays the total number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests** This KPI indicates how many guests have requested free pickup and how many have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These KPIs are specifically added for the database's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Booking Details Table

The main part of the template is a simple table at the bottom where booking details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The table includes the following columns:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request** A customizable field for any specific requests from the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date** This column only includes the date by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Users can choose to include time by clicking on the date field and entering the specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Departure Date** Similar to the arrival date, time can also be added to the departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Room Type** Guests can select a specific room type from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. New room types can be added by typing them in, which automatically creates a new category and updates the KPI section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Icons for room types can also be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Changes made in the table are automatically reflected in the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Guest Count** This field allows users to add the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While not displayed in the top KPI by default, it can be added with customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup** A simple "Yes" or "No" option that automatically updates the free pickup summary KPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

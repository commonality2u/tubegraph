The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users track paycheck payments and manage budgets effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It assists in keeping track of budgeted payments to maintain financial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Expense Tracking Sections

The tracker is divided into two main sections: the Summary section on the left and the Account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an [[understanding_the_expenses_overview | overview]] of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses that have been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses that have been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Account Section

Under the Account section, users can [[adding_and_managing_income_and_expenses | add expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Expenses are organized under three primary heads:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Transaction Section

The Transaction section is where all transactions related to every expense can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Once transactions are added, they reflect under the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, incurred expenses, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[budgeting_and_expense_tracking | budgeting and expense tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Customizing and Managing Expenses

### Defining Expense Categories

The three default expense heads can be changed to different items by clicking on them and setting a custom category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This provides flexibility in [[how_to_define_and_modify_expense_categories | how to define and modify expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts

Users can set their [[adjusting_budget_and_actual_expenses | budgeted amount]] for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Efficient Expense Addition

### Quick Action Buttons

The tracker includes [[using_quick_addition_buttons_for_efficient_expense_tracking | quick action buttons]] for streamlined data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Add Transaction**: Clicking this button automatically adds a transaction with the current date, allowing users to then feed in the specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Adding and Organizing Expense Sources

*   **Add Expense Source**: This button automatically adds an expense underneath one of the main expense heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, it might add an expense source under "fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Reorganizing Expense Sources**: Once an expense source is added, it can be moved and placed under a particular source of expense by clicking on the three dots associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This facilitates [[adding_and_editing_expense_sources_and_categories | adding and editing expense sources and categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users track paycheck payments and manage budgets effectively, ensuring they stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Expense Management Overview

The tracker is divided into two main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

*   **Summary Section (Left Side)**: Displays key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
    *   Total budgeted expenses set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
    *   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   Percentage of budgeted expense spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Account Section (Right Side)**: Where users [[updating_and_managing_project_expenses | add and manage expenses]] and their associated categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Adding and Categorizing Expenses

Within the account section, expenses can be added under three default heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

### Customizing Expense Categories
Users have the flexibility to change these default heads to their own customized categories. This can be done by clicking on the category, setting a new name, and confirming the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The system automatically updates the category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts
Once categories are set up, users can [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | set a budgeted amount for each expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

The [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | Transaction section]] is where all transactions related to every expense are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. After transactions are entered, they reflect under the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, expenses incurred, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Quick Actions

The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline the [[data_entry_in_expense_details_database | data entry]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:

*   **Add Transaction Button**: Automatically adds a new transaction with the current date, allowing users to feed in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source Button**: Automatically adds a new expense category under one of the main heads, such as "Fixed Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Users can then move this new expense source to any desired category using the three dots option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This functionality helps users [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track their budgeted payments]] and maintain financial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments in the Summary View
To review your debt status, go to the "Summary" section and then the "Debt view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The debt view has two main sections:
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Shows payments due in the future relative to the current date (e.g., a car loan due September 29th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Shows payments that were due in the past and might have been missed or have not had their next payment recorded (e.g., a credit card payment last made on July 14th, indicating no August payment if the current date is August 30th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Each debt entry displays:
*   The total loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   The total repayment made (in percentage and amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   The next payment due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The last payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

2.  Select "Layout" to choose between "Listicle," "Gallery," or "Board" views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
3.  In the "Property" section, you can enable or disable desired properties (e.g., total amount paid, repayment percentage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
4.  The "Group by" option can be set to "Payment Status" (Upcoming/Past) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

The "Accountant Guy," An Biswal, demonstrates how to use a monthly budget planner template in Notion to organize personal finances and [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | budget for each month]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Notion Monthly Budget Planner Overview

The Notion monthly budget planner features four primary views to help users track their spending:
*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Summary of All Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

The template pre-defines four expense categories: Shopping, Entertainment, Food, and Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, but users can add their own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

For each expense category, the planner displays:
*   The total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   The budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   The percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if the user is still under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

The monthly and yearly overviews present this same information, but categorized by month and year, respectively, offering a quick glance at expense trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The summary section provides a complete financial overlook, grouping all expenses to show overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[Entering transactions in Notion | Entering Transactions]] in the Expense Details Database

To begin [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking transactions and expenses in Notion]], users interact with the "Expense Details" database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. All expenses are categorized by month, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

To [[entering_transactions_in_notion | enter a transaction]]:
1.  Click the "New" button in the Expense Details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date of the transaction (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The month automatically adjusts based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Provide the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant "Period" (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the "Year" (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the "Category" of the expense (e.g., "Utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  Input the "Expense Code," which is used to group expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the expense amount in the "Expense Amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This column is distinct from the "Budget Amount" column, which is used for setting budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

As more expense information is added, all figures in the overview sections are automatically updated, providing real-time insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Information

After [[how_to_set_up_and_use_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | booking expenses]], the Notion budget planner allows for detailed analysis through its various views:
*   **Period View:** Clicking on a period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window displaying all transactions booked for that period, including amounts and whether they were budget or actual expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View:** Similar to the period view, clicking on a year displays budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expense as a percentage of budget, and budget status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View:** This view shows expense amounts, budgeted amounts, expense percentages, and status for each category. It also lists all transactions related to that specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View:** Users can see how much has been booked for a particular category within a specific month compared to the total budget for that expense code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This system enables comprehensive [[tracking expenses and income in Notion | tracking of expenses and income in Notion]], offering detailed insights into financial performance across different timeframes and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

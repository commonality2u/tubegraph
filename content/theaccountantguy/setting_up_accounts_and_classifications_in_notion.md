The Notion business cash flow template allows users to define and manage various accounts, which are crucial for tracking financial movements within the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This section provides an overview of how to set up and manage these accounts.

## Account Section Overview

The "Account section" is located on the right side of the cash flow overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Clicking on it reveals different types of accounts that can be configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Types of Accounts

Accounts are categorized under different heads within the template:
*   **Assets:** Includes pre-defined accounts like cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Users can add or edit these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

The same principles for setting up assets apply to liabilities, income, and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Adding and Editing Accounts

### Editing Existing Accounts
To edit an existing account (e.g., an asset), click the pencil icon next to its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. You can then enter a preferred new name for the asset, and the name will update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
To add a new item under any category (Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses), click the "New" button located under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Account Properties and Details

Each account has several properties that can be configured:

### Opening Balance
This represents the starting balance of the account when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Classifications
Classifications define how a specific item is categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For example, a credit card might be classified as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   To add a new classification, click on the classification field and select the option to add a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   To edit an existing classification, click the three-dot icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Payment Frequency
This specifies how frequently payments are received for a particular item, which is particularly useful for tracking income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, interest income might have a quarterly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Users can select from available frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Opening Units
This field is relevant only for investments or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For inventory, you can specify an opening unit count and an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Asset Class
This property is also relevant for inventory or investments under the asset category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Inventory items can be put under an "inventory asset class," and investments under an "investment asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Once accounts are assigned, they can be used when [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | entering transactions and managing accounts in Notion]] to track cash flow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

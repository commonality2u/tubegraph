This guide outlines the features and functionality of a [[using_a_personal_finance_tracker_spreadsheet | personal finance tracker]] developed in a Google Sheet, designed to help individuals manage their finances effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is primarily for personal use but can also be adapted for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The tracker is entirely dynamic and aims to simplify financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The Google Sheet tracker comprises five main tabs, in addition to an instructions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Monthly Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Investment Dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Sinking Fund Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Debt Payment Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Report Section (Dynamic Reporting Presentation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

## Monthly Budget Tab

The Monthly Budget tab allows users to set and track their monthly income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It features an expenses overview on the left and an income overview on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Expenses Overview
Users define their monthly expenses, such as gas, Wi-Fi, and phone bills, and set a budgeted amount for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Entries are made in a "transactions area" on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Values highlighted in the overview are auto-computed based on transaction entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

For each expense category, the sheet displays:
*   Incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   Difference between budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Status (under budget or over budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

If an actual expense entry exceeds the budgeted amount, the status dynamically changes to "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Income Overview
Similar to expenses, users can set targeted income amounts for respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. As income entries are made in the transactions area, the overview automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Transaction Area
This section allows users to input dates, details (from a dropdown including income and expense categories), and amounts for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Dynamic Overview
A dynamic overview on the left summarizes total budgeted amounts, total incurred expenses, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A graphical presentation shows budgeted versus actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. On the right, an income overview displays total targeted income, actual income achieved, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, with a corresponding graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This tab helps [[using_google_sheets_for_budgeting | using Google Sheets for budgeting]] and tracking all bill payments, subscription expenses, and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Investment Dashboard

This [[portfolio_tracker_using_google_sheets | Portfolio tracker using Google Sheets]] is completely dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Users only need to enter the stock symbol, number of shares, and purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. All other values, such as the current price and graph, update automatically in real-time as trading happens in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

The dashboard provides a quick representation of:
*   Market value of holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Cost vs. market value analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   Growth and symbol representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
*   Portfolio value, gain, and percentage gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Dividend income and total holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

## Sinking Fund Analysis

This section helps manage [[setting_financial_goals_and_net_worth_tracking | sinking funds]] by tracking contributions towards specific financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Users specify for each sinking fund:
*   Goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
*   Monthly contribution amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Any starting amount already saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>

Based on entries, the sheet displays:
*   Amount saved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Amount left to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Total progress percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   Estimated completion date and months remaining, assuming consistent monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

A graph visually represents total savings made versus savings still needed for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Debt Payment Report

This tab is crucial for managing and tracking debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Users input debt information including:
*   Loan amount taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   Interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
*   Minimum EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>
*   Any additional down payment made when obtaining the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   Initial repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

The sheet automatically calculates and displays:
*   Loan outstanding at the beginning of the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
*   Estimated date of debt freedom, assuming minimum repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Total interest repaid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   Total principal repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
*   Total repayment value and repayment percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>

When making repayment entries on the right, users specify the date, choose the debt, and enter the EMI amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The sheet then auto-computes the interest value, principal value, and remaining loan outstanding for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

An overview on the left shows the total amount paid (in green) and the amount left for repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It also aggregates total loan amount, total repaid amount (broken into principal and interest), outstanding amount, total repayment percentage, number of loans, and total minimum EMI to pay for all loans combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Reporting Section

This section provides a dynamic reporting presentation, which is a core feature of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Users can select from a dropdown to view reports on expenses, income, sinking funds, or debt details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

By selecting a specific month, the total values and a quick pie chart reflecting the division of income or expenses for that period are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Changing the month or report type dynamically updates the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This feature is highly useful for analyzing finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

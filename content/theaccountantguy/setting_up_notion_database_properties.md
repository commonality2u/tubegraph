[[setting_up_and_using_databases_in_notion | Notion databases]] are powerful tools for storing, managing, and tracking information in a structured and organized manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. A key component of any [[creating_a_database_in_notion | Notion database]] is its collection of properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. These properties define the different types of data that can be stored within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Database Creation Steps

To set up properties for a Notion database, a three-step approach can be followed:
1.  [[creating_a_database_in_notion | Create a database]] to hold the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
2.  [[setting_up_notion_properties_and_relations | Set up the database correctly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
3.  Add the desired formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Understanding Default Properties

Every Notion database includes a default property, which is the first column of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This property's type is always "Title" and cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Adding Properties to a Database

To add properties within a Notion database:
1.  Click on the "plus" symbol located at the top right end of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
2.  Once selected, a list of options will appear, allowing you to choose the desired property type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Example Properties for Summing Numbers

For an example where two numbers are summed within a database, the following properties would be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>:
*   **Test Title Property**: This is the default "Title" property, serving as the first column of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Paper 1 Number Property**: Select the "Number" property type and name it "Paper 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Paper 2 Number Property**: Another "Number" property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Formula 1 Formula Property**: Set the property type as "Formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Formula 2 Formula Property**: Another "Formula" property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

After setting up the necessary properties, you can then proceed to apply formulas to perform calculations or other operations within your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

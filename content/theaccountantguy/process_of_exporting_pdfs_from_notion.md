This article outlines the process of [[pdf_document_generation_from_notion | generating PDF documents from Notion]] using a dedicated tool like [[using_pdfoutput_tool_for_notion | PDF output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The demonstration focuses on [[generating_pdf_documents_with_notion | generating boarding pass PDF documents from Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Prerequisites in Notion

To begin [[creating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | creating PDF documents from a Notion database]], you need:
*   A Notion database containing the details you wish to export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For instance, a "boarding pass database" with flight and passenger information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   A Notion template designed for the PDF output, such as a "boarding pass template," from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Connecting to the PDF Output Tool

The process involves [[connecting_notion_with_pdf_output_via_api | connecting Notion with PDF Output via API]] or a similar tool:
1.  Access the PDF output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Input a connection name, for example, "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
3.  Select the relevant Notion database, like "boarding pass database," to connect to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Choose the specific Notion template that will be used for the PDF layout, such as the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
5.  Proceed to the next step, where the tool will load all the information from the selected database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Generating the Documents

Once the data is loaded, the [[automation_of_document_export_in_notion | automation of document export in Notion]] can begin:
1.  Confirm that all necessary information has been loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  Initiate the export process by clicking "export" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  The tool will then start [[generating_pdf_documents_from_a_notion_database | generating PDF documents from a Notion database]] based on the template and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Reviewing and Downloading PDFs

After the export is successful:
1.  You can preview a sample of the generated PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This allows verification that the boarding pass, for instance, includes all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  After downloading, the files can be extracted and opened to view the individual PDF outputs, each with potentially different names and contexts based on the database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

This process demonstrates how to effectively utilize [[using_notion_with_pdf_output | PDF output]] to [[generating_purchase_order_pdfs_using_notion | generate various PDF documents]] directly from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

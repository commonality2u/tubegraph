2.  **Select a [[using_gpt_models_with_the_chatbot | GPT Model]]** After entering the API key, you must choose a [[using_gpt_models_with_the_chatbot | GPT model]] from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Interface Sections

### Examples of Formula Queries
The chatbot can help derive various Notion formulas:
*   **Adding Two Numbers:** For a basic request like adding two numbers, the chatbot suggests a simple formula, e.g., `property A + property B` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Time Difference Between Dates:** When asked for a formula to find the difference between a birth date and today's date in years, the chatbot provides the `dateBetween` formula along with instructions on how to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **IF Condition:** For more complex queries involving conditional logic, such as an IF condition (e.g., if number one is greater than number two, output number one, otherwise number two), the chatbot generates the correct formula and provides a detailed explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Sanat Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to utilize a subscription expenses tracker within [[tracking_expenses_with_notion | Notion]] to manage all subscription-related outgoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is designed to help users [[notion_expense_tracker_setup | set up an expense tracker in Notion]] for their personal subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The tracker features a "Subscription Overview" section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Subscriptions are categorized into "active" and "canceled" views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For each subscription listed, the following details are displayed:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Billing period (which can be changed by clicking on it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

## Expenses Section

Below the overview, the "Expenses section" further divides subscriptions into different categories, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Users can add new groups by clicking a plus icon or edit existing group names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Within each classification, the following information is available:
*   Subscription name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

A "quick action button" allows for instantly adding a new subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Newly added subscriptions initially appear under a "no subscription category" and can be moved to any classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Details can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" is where detailed expenses for subscriptions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It includes views for both "active subscriptions" and "canceled subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top, and the total sum of expenses for each month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

To record a transaction:
1.  **Status**: A checkbox indicates if the subscription is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: Select from a list of previously added subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the setting defined in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Choose the date of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Enter the expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
6.  **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the payment date and billing period (e.g., 30 days for a monthly billing period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To cancel a subscription, simply click the status checkbox, and it will be moved to the canceled status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. A "quick subscription" button allows for rapidly adding new entries and filling in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This tool is designed to help users with [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

To perform calculations like finding the difference between two numbers in Notion, you assign "number" as a [[properties_in_notion_databases | property]] type to specific entries within a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This allows [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] to operate on these numerical values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Setting Up Number Properties

Before performing calculations, you first need to [[creating_a_database_in_notion_for_calculations | create a database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After creating the database, which includes a default title [[properties_in_notion_databases | property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, you then assign the [[properties_in_notion_databases | properties]] of numbers to specific columns (fields) where your numerical data will reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Using Number Properties in Formulas

Once numbers are assigned as [[properties_in_notion_databases | properties]], they can be used as inputs for various [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] to perform operations such as finding differences. Two methods for finding the difference between two numbers, `number one` and `number two`, include:

*   **Subtract Operator** The `subtract` operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if you provide `number one` and `number two` as inputs, it returns their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Minus Sign (`-`)** You can also use the simpler minus sign (`-`) to find the difference between two given numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

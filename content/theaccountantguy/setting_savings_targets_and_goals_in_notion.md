The [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] in [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | Notion]] features a dashboard with two main views for managing your savings: "Savings Target" and "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Savings Target View

This view is where you [[how_to_set_financial_goals_in_notion | set financial goals]] by defining different saving funds and their corresponding target amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The template comes with three default saving funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Editing Existing Saving Funds
To [[editing_and_managing_savings_in_notion | edit any existing saving funds]], click the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Name:** You can rename the saving fund (e.g., changing "Emergency Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount:** You can adjust the target goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

You can also click directly on the fund's entry to open a pop-up window where you can edit the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Saving Funds

To delete a saving fund, click the six dots on the left side of the fund's entry and select the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Savings Overview View

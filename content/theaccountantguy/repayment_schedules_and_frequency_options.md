The debt payment tracker allows users to manage and categorize their debts based on different repayment schedules and frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Debt Categories and Details
The [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | Debt Overview]] section initially categorizes debts into annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Each debt entry includes:
*   Debt details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) amount for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Initial repayment date (first installment payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   "Debt free by" calculation, indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified rate and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Number of EMIs, showing how many installments are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Managing Repayment Frequencies
The tracker provides flexibility in defining and managing repayment frequencies.

### Adding New Frequencies
Users can add new repayment frequency categories by clicking the "add a group" button and specifying a new installment period, such as "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This action automatically inserts the new repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Pre-added payment schedules are also available for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Hidden groups can reveal additional categories like quarterly and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Moving Debts Between Categories
Existing debts can be moved to any preferred repayment schedule. By selecting a debt item, users can drag and drop it into another category (e.g., quarterly), and the repayment schedule and associated calculations will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Automatic Schedule Updates
The tracker automatically calculates the next repayment schedule based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Monthly Payments:** For a student loan set to monthly payments, if a payment is made on September 30, the next payment is automatically scheduled for October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Annual Payments:** For an annual home loan payment made on September 27, 2023, the next repayment will be scheduled for September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Users can add new debt payments to the schedule based on the current date by clicking the "pay debt amount" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Editing existing loan details, such as the debt field, will automatically update relevant columns and descriptions throughout the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Notion's Freelancers OS dashboard includes a dedicated section for managing and prioritizing projects, allowing freelancers to keep track of all work being performed for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This system helps organize projects, track their progress, and understand their financial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Project Section Overview
The project section allows users to monitor various projects associated with client contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects are categorized by priority: low, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Adding a New Project
To add a new project:
1.  Navigate to the project section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
2.  Click the "new" button under the desired priority category (e.g., "high priority") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
4.  Add a project value, which can be part of a larger contract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
5.  Assign a completion date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This can be a single date or a date range (start and end date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
6.  Update the project's status (e.g., "not started") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Project Details and Customization
Each project entry can be clicked to reveal more detailed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>:
*   **Status**: Indicates the current state of the project (e.g., "in progress," "not started"). These options can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Priority**: Reflects the project's importance, allowing users to move projects between low, medium, and high priority categories by dragging and dropping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Priority levels can also be redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Completion Date**: The target date or period for project completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Project Completion Percentage**: This metric is calculated based on either estimated hours or total invoice value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Hourly Basis**: Users can specify estimated hours for a project and then input actual hours worked. For example, if a project is estimated for 10 hours and 7 actual hours are logged, the completion is 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
    *   **Invoicing Basis**: If no hours are specified, the completion percentage is calculated based on the ratio of invoiced amounts to the total project value. For instance, if a project has a total value of $6,000 and $3,000 has been invoiced, the project is 50% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Assigned Invoices**: Shows the invoices linked to this specific project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Client**: Indicates the client for whom the project is being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Services**: Displays the specific services provided under this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

Users can also edit existing properties by clicking the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Workflow Integration
Income transactions classified as "client" in the finance section are automatically reflected in the workflow section of the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. From here, users can assign an income entry to a specific invoice, client, project, and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Adding or linking information in the workflow section automatically updates the corresponding sections, such as client details, project details, and invoicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This allows for flexible data entry, either by creating new entries from the top-level sections (invoices, clients, projects, services) or directly within the workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

This integrated approach helps manage various aspects of freelancing, from [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | financial tracking]] to project management and client relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

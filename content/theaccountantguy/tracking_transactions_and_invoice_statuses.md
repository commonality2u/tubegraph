The accounts receivable and payable tracker is a tool designed to [[handling_transactions_and_attaching_invoices | track all customer and vendor balances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive view of outstanding amounts and transaction histories.

## Accounts View
The "Accounts view" section, located at the top of the tracker, allows users to set up details for their customers and vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This includes:
*   **Customer and Vendor Details:** Setting up names and other relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Opening Balances:** Inputting the starting receivable or payable balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Due Invoices:** Specifying the number of invoices pending against the opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Quick action buttons are available to "Add vendor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> or "Add customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, and a pencil icon allows for editing these details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Receivable Section
This section displays all receivable accounts and their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows customer accounts (e.g., Sandra and Harry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> along with all [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] carried out for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Invoice Status:** Users can change the status of invoices (e.g., "Pending," "Paid," "Overdue") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking:** A checkbox allows marking an invoice as "paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When checked, the paid amount is not included in the outstanding balance calculation at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance:** For each customer, the total outstanding amount is reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Payable Section
Similar to the receivable section, the payable section shows details of each transaction for vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It includes:
*   Transaction date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

Users can also click the "paid" checkbox to update outstanding balances at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section
The summary section provides an overall financial snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It displays:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   Net balance (calculated from all transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

## Transaction Section
This section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Receivable Segment
Users can add and manage details for receivable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, including:
*   Date of transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   Period (selectable from four quarterly options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Account name (customer name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

Feeding in these details automatically updates all related sections of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A "paid" checkbox is available; checking it ensures the amount is not reflected in total balances for the person concerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Quick action buttons are available:
*   **Add receivable entry:** Automatically adds a new entry with the current date, ready for detail input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Add payable entry:** Adds a new entry for payable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Transactions are categorized by month, with later months appearing at the top, and an indication of the number of transactions per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Segment
This segment functions similarly to the receivable segment but for vendor transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The quarterly summary provides an overview of all combined quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

The total amounts for all quarters are also reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

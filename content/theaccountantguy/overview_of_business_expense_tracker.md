This document provides a walkthrough of a [[overview_of_notion_expense_tracker | business expense tracker]] designed to help keep track of all [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | business expenses]] under one General Ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

*   **Dynamic Updates**: Changes made to the [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budget]] in the expense categories (e.g., changing advertising [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budget]] from $100 to $5,000) will automatically update in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

This article provides an overview of a business cash flow template designed to [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | track cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The template helps users [[income_and_expense_management | manage income and expenses]] and monitor cash flow movements within their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template's cash flow overview section provides a summary of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Total Inflow:** Cash received from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Total Outflow:** Cash paid out through transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Closing Balance:** The final cash balance, which updates as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Account Management

Users can set up and manage various accounts within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This includes:

### Assets
Default asset categories include cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can add new assets or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For each asset, the following details can be specified:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting balance of the asset when using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Classifications:** How the asset is classified, such as 'debt' for a credit card, or payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. New classifications can be added or existing ones edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency:** How often payments are received or made for a particular item, useful for [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Opening Units:** Relevant for investments or inventory items, specifying the number of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** Used to categorize items, such as 'inventory' for inventory items or 'investment' for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This same principle of adding and editing items applies to liabilities, income, and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. New items can be added by clicking 'new' under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The quarterly overview provides a summary of cash flow movements for each month, grouped by quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. For each month and quarter, it displays:
*   **Inflow:** Cash received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Outflow:** Cash paid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Net Balance:** The difference between inflow and outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These figures automatically update as transactions are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Business Activity

The business activity section categorizes cash flow into three types:

*   **Operating Activities:** Relate to the core operations of the business, such as salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Investing Activities:** Pertain to investments made by the business, like stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Financing Activities:** Involve raising loans or debt to fund the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Each category shows its respective inflow, outflow, and net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>

Users can specify units and prices for purchases and sales of investments (e.g., Apple stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> and inventory to calculate total values and profit or loss on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

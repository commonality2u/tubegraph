The Paycheck Budget Tracker allows users to efficiently track paycheck payments and manage budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A core feature of this tracker is the ability to [[creating_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | categorize expenses]] within the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Default Expense Categories

Initially, expenses can be added under three predefined categories, referred to as "heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   Fixed expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## Customizing Expense Categories

Users have the flexibility to [[customizing_expense_categories | change]] these default heads to different items or categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This can be done by clicking on the category, [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | setting a new category name]], and confirming by clicking "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The changes will be applied automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Specific Expense Sources

Within these broader categories, specific expense sources can be added and managed:
*   **Adding Expense Sources**: A "Add Expense Source" quick action button is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Clicking this button automatically adds a new expense entry underneath one of the existing heads, such as "Fixed Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Relocating Expense Sources**: Once an expense source is added, it can be moved to be placed under a different category or "source of expense" by clicking on the three dots icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Setting Budgeted Amounts

For each [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | expense category]] or source, users can set a specific budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The tracker displays the total budgeted expenses, total incurred expenses, and the difference between the two, as well as the percentage of budgeted expense spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This helps users track their budgeted payments and stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

A Notion template can be used to track business expenses related to construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This template defines different [[setting_up_expense_categories | categories of expenses]] at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each category, a budgeted expense amount and actual expenses are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table at the bottom of the template, where values can be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Changes made in the table update the expenses corresponding to the category at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

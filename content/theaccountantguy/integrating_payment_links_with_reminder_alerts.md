This article demonstrates how to [[integrating_payment_links_for_loan_repayments | receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp]] with an integrated "pay now" link, utilizing a Notion database setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This method allows for [[receiving_timely_payment_reminders_through_whatsapp | timely payment reminders]] and direct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Setting Up Subscription Payment Reminders

The process involves configuring reminders through a database, enabling users to [[receiving_timely_payment_reminders_through_whatsapp | receive reminder messages]] on their WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

1.  **Create a New Template**: Begin by clicking a dropdown menu and selecting the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This provides an option for [[creating_templates_for_loan_payment_reminders | setting up a subscription reminder alert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   **Specify Details**: For instance, set up a subscription reminder for Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Type the subscription name (e.g., Spotify) and specify the amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. After this, a new template will be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

2.  **Set Repetition**: Click on the three dots next to the newly added template and select "repeat" to set the desired repetition mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, to repeat the reminder every month, select the "every month" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This will ensure the Spotify subscription reminder of $150 repeats each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   **Specify Time and Start Date**: A new window will open to specify the time and start date for the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Set the desired time (e.g., 11:56) and confirm it should repeat every month on a specific day (e.g., the 23rd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Save**: Once saved, a repetition arrow will appear, indicating that the Spotify subscription reminder alert will automatically repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This setup is similar to [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | scheduling recurring bill payment notifications]] or [[notion_invoice_payment_reminder_setup | Notion invoice payment reminder setup]].

## How the Reminder System Works

Once the reminder is set, the system automatically adds a new line item in the database at the specified time and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, a notification alert is automatically received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **WhatsApp Notification**: The notification includes a payment reminder for the specified amount (e.g., $150 for Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Integrated Pay Now Link**: Crucially, the message includes a "pay now" link, allowing direct payment of the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This functionality extends to various reminder types such as [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_WhatsApp | setting up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]], [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_WhatsApp | automating subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]], [[setting_up_automated_debt_payment_reminders_on_WhatsApp | automated debt payment reminders on WhatsApp]], or [[setting_up_repayment_notifications_for_credit_cards | repayment notifications for credit cards]].

## Customization and Availability

The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is fully customizable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. There is no fixed template, allowing users to tailor the message as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Upon downloading the template, comprehensive instructions and guides are available to help users set up this automation independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

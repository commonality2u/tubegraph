The [[charity_donation_tracking_using_notion | charity donation tracker]] allows users to effectively [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals | set targets]] and monitor progress towards their donation goals for various charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The system is structured into key sections: Donation Funds Overview, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The initial step involves [[setting_up_funds_and_categories_for_donations | setting up donation funds]] by categorizing them (e.g., Health, Environment, Education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Users can edit existing categories or add new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Under each category, specific funds (e.g., American Red Cross, Sierra Club) can be added and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

When setting up a fund, users define several key goal and timeline parameters:
*   **Fund Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Opening Balance:** The amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Donation:** The desired total donation amount for the specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For example, a target of $10,000 can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Start Date:** The date since donations began for this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Target Date (End Date):** The deadline by which the targeted donation amount is aimed to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, a target end date of December 31st can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Tracking Recent Donations

The "Recent Donations" section tracks all contributions on a month-wise basis, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
For each donation entry, users provide:
*   **Date:** When the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Period:** The specific month and year of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. New periods can be created as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Fund:** The specific fund to which the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Recommended Contribution (`Recomment`)
Upon selecting a fund, the system calculates a "recomment" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This represents the amount of contribution needed *every month* from the fund's start date until its target end date, to reach the targeted total donation amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. For instance, if a Sierra Club fund was set up on June 16th with a target date of February 29th, the recommended monthly contribution might be approximately $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Performance Indicators
Users input the actual donation amount made each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The system then provides visual feedback on whether the monthly goal was met:
*   **Check Mark:** Indicates that the contribution met or exceeded the monthly "recomment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Cross Mark:** Indicates that the contribution fell short of the monthly "recomment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Quarterly and Fund-Specific Overviews

### Quarterly Overview
This section displays donations made for each month, grouped into quarters (Q1: January-March, Q2: April-June, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. For each month, it shows the total donations made versus the total requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Visual indicators help in quickly [[evaluating_donation_performance_and_progress | evaluating progress]] against monthly goals:
*   **Red Color:** Signifies that the donation is falling short of the monthly requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, along with the percentage of the target met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Green Color:** Indicates that enough donations were made to meet or exceed the monthly requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Blue Color:** Appears when the total donation exactly equals the donation requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

A cumulative total of donations for all months combined within a quarter is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Donations Overview (Fund-Wise)
This view provides a specific overview for each donation fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. For each fund, it displays:
*   **Total Donation:** Includes the opening balance and any subsequent donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Target Amount:** The overall goal set for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Percentage Reached:** How much of the targeted amount has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For instance, $1,000 donated towards a $5,000 target means 20% reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Time Left:** The number of months remaining until the target date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This automatically updates as time passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month:** The average monthly contribution needed from the start date to the end date to meet the targeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Overall Progress Summary

The summary section provides a high-level overview of all donation goals and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>:
*   **Total Donation Required:** The summation of all individual fund donation requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Total Donation Made So Far:** The cumulative amount donated across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Shortfall:** The difference between the total required and the total made, indicating how much more is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Percentage Reached:** The total donations made as a percentage of the total donation requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

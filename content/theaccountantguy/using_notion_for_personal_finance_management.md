## Net Worth Tracker Overview

The Net Worth Tracker developed in Notion consists of three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

1.  **Get Started Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
    *   Used for specifying your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Account Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
    *   Allows specifying various accounts for personal finance calculation, including expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Provides an overview of all finances, displaying accounts with their closing balances and proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

    *   Features a Transactions view where all income, expenses, assets, and liabilities details are fed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts

### Setting Net Worth Goal
To begin, set your net worth goal in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:59">[01:56:59]</a>. This value can be edited to any amount, for instance, changing it from $10,000 to $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:49">[02:02:49]</a>. The database automatically updates once this value is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:78">[02:18:78]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Accounts
In the account section, you can add new accounts or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:08">[02:23:08]</a>.

*   **Adding a New Account**: Click the "New" button under the relevant category (e.g., income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:86">[02:30:86]</a>.
    *   **Account Name**: Enter the name (e.g., "Interest Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:89">[02:47:89]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Income and expenses typically do not have an opening balance, but assets and liabilities can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.
    *   **Classification**: Assign a tag to the account (e.g., "Other Income" for interest income, "Bills" for groceries, "Subscription" for Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. You can add new categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency**: Categorize how often payments are received or made (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:49">[03:56:49]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:31">[04:18:31]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units/Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:90">[04:28:90]</a>. For income or expense accounts, they can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:73">[04:34:73]</a>. For investments like Bitcoin, an opening balance, classification (e.g., crypto), and opening units (e.g., 10 units) are specified, and the asset class is set to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:91">[05:24:91]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Accounts**: Click the pencil icon next to an account to open an edit window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:95">[04:57:95]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: You can add debt payments and other loans, setting their payment frequency as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:21">[06:06:21]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions
The transaction section has four main views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:89">[06:46:89]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:77">[07:03:77]</a>.

To enter a transaction, click "New" in the respective view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:87">[07:12:87]</a>:

*   **Date**: Select the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:67">[07:23:67]</a>. This automatically classifies it into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:86">[07:32:86]</a>.
*   **Description**: Add a description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:78">[07:37:78]</a>.
*   **Category**: This is pre-filled based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:64">[07:41:64]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the specific account created earlier (e.g., "Salary Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Indicate how money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:99">[07:54:99]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: This determines if it's an inflow or outflow of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:92">[08:08:92]</a>.
    *   **Income**: Inflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:61">[08:12:61]</a>.
    *   **Expenses**: Outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:87">[08:14:87]</a>.
    *   **Assets**: Inflow if selling, outflow if buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Liabilities**: Inflow if taking on more loan, outflow if repaying loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:72">[09:27:72]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Specify the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:13">[08:28:13]</a>.

## Summary Section - Calculating Net Worth

After inputting all transactions and accounts, the "Summary" section calculates your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

### Finances View
This view shows all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities as of the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

### Net Worth View
The Net Worth view provides five statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>:

*   **Net Worth Goal**: The goal amount set in the "Get Started" section (e.g., $14,000, which can be changed to $12,000 and updates automatically) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. For example, $6,950 (assets) minus $1,600 (liabilities) equals $5,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The difference between the net worth goal and the total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. For instance, $12,000 (goal) minus $5,350 (total net worth) equals $6,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The closing net worth value minus the opening net worth value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities (e.g., $1,900 + $900 = $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. If closing net worth is $5,350, the total growth would be $4,350 ($5,350 - $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: How much of the total net worth has been achieved relative to the net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This is calculated as (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) * 100% (e.g., $5,350 / $12,000 = 45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

As transactions are added and items are managed, the net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

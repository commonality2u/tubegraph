The business plan template, introduced by "the accountant guy" Anat Biswal, is designed to facilitate [[stages_of_business_planning | business planning]] by organizing tasks and objectives within distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers two primary views: the Business Plan Road Map and the [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Business Plan Road Map

The Business Plan Road Map divides the entire [[stages_of_business_planning | business planning]] process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template comes with 11 predefined stages, which can be edited as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These stages range from "Conceptional Research" to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Defining Stages and Objectives

For each stage, users can define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These objectives can be set for a particular business plan and correspond to a specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Associating Tasks and Deadlines

Within each business planning stage, various tasks are associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, the "Conception and Research" stage might have two specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Each task includes a deadline for its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Tracking Task Status and Completion

Tasks can be tracked for their completion status:
*   A checkbox indicates if a task is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Users can assign a specific status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed," etc.) as per requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Adding New Tasks and Documentation

*   New tasks can be added to any specific stage using a dedicated icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   A documentation section is available at the bottom of each stage's view, allowing for detailed specification of objectives and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This section helps users learn more about a specific [[stages_of_business_planning | business planning]] stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[updating_completion_status_in_business_planning | Updating Completion Status]]

The template automatically calculates the completion percentage for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. When any task within a stage is marked as complete, the overall completion percentage for that stage updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Completing both tasks brings the percentage to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]]

The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] view presents all the planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   It displays specific deadline dates for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Users can see the timeline set for specific stages, such as December 3 to December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Each entry on the timeline shows the stage name, associated task, date, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Arrows on the timeline reflect the dates for all stages, and clicking them allows users to view detailed properties and information for specific dates and stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

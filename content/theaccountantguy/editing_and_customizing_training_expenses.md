The Employee Training Expenses Tracker provides a comprehensive dashboard for [[tracking expenses]] related to employee training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The dashboard offers two primary views: Training Overview and Employee Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. All information within the tracker is designed to be editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Training Overview and Customization
The Training Overview section displays details for each individual training, including:
*   The training date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   The number of employees expected to attend ("employees count") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   The percentage of actual attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   The training expense for each session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

This information is directly [[customizing_categories_for_expense_tracking | editable and customizable]] through parameters located at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Employee Records Management

### Department Customization

### Employee Details and Attendance Tracking
Each employee record shows the total number of trainings they've attended out of the trainings they were supposed to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It also displays their percentage of attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> and allows for specifying a "next training date," which automatically calculates the remaining days until that training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

To manage employee details:
*   **Adding an Employee**: Click "add employee" at the bottom of the Employee Details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. New employees are initially placed under a "no department" view and can then be moved to a specific department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Editing an Employee**: Click the edit button next to an employee's name to modify their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Expenses Overview and Dynamic Updates
The "Expenses Overview" on the left panel provides a summary of all training-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This includes:
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>

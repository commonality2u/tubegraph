[[creating_recurring_payment_reminders|Creating recurring payment reminders]] allows individuals to receive notifications, particularly on WhatsApp, for upcoming debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system can be customized for any loan or recurring payment and provides a convenient way to stay on top of financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## How it Works: An Example

As an illustration, consider a car loan of $3,000 due on September 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The system sends a "Debt Payment Reminder Alert" via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The message includes details like the loan type, due date, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Crucially, a "Pay Now" button or link can be embedded, redirecting the user to a bank portal or payment platform (like PayPal) for instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Setting Up a Recurring Payment Template

To receive [[setting_up_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp|debt payment reminders on WhatsApp]], the first step is to [[using_templates_for_subscription_payment_reminders|create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Steps to Create a Template

1.  **Initiate Template Creation**: Click on the dropdown menu and select the "New Template" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **Enter Loan Details**: Input the specifics of the loan, such as "Car Loan" and the repayment amount of "$3,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  **Set Repetition**: For each new template, there is an option to set it as a "repeating template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   **Frequency**: Choose the repetition frequency, such as "monthly basis" for recurring payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Day and Time**: Specify the exact day of the month (e.g., the 16th) and a specific time for the reminder to be triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This ensures the loan item is automatically added to the database on that schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Time Zone**: Select the appropriate time zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Notification Timing**:
    *   The system allows you to receive notifications a specific number of days *before* the actual due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, by setting a "7" in the "days" field, a notification will be sent seven days prior to the loan's due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   If you prefer the notification to occur on the actual due date, set the value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Once saved, this recurring template will automatically trigger an [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases|automation]] each month, sending the payment notification message to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Automation and Customization

The system is designed for [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases|automating payment reminder alerts using databases]] and sending notifications via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. When a new loan entry is automatically populated in the database based on the template schedule, a WhatsApp message is triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This means a new loan or recurring payment can be added automatically, and a payment alert will appear on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

This process can be [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases|automated for any number of loans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Messages are completely customizable, allowing users to create custom messages as per their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Managing Templates

Once a loan is fully repaid, the corresponding template can be easily deleted to prevent future, unnecessary notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

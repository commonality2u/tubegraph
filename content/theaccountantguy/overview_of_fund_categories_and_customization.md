This article explains how to manage and [[customizing_the_notion_budget_template | customize]] emergency fund categories and individual funds within a tracking template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template provides a summary, savings overview, and a detailed contribution section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The fund setup section allows users to define and manage different types of emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Predefined Categories

Initially, the template includes three main categories for organizing funds:
*   Financial safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

### Customizing Categories

Users have the flexibility to [[setting_and_modifying_expense_categories | customize]] these categories:
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: Click on a category to edit its name or definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This is similar to [[customizing_expense_categories | customizing expense categories]] or [[setting_expense_categories | setting expense categories]] in a budget.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category or "group" can be added by clicking the "add a group" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is similar to [[setting_up_funds_and_categories_for_donations | setting up funds and categories for donations]].

### Adding and Managing Funds

Individual emergency funds can be added and detailed:
1.  **Add a New Fund**: Click the "add fund" button to automatically create a new fund, which initially appears under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  **Assign to a Category**: Move the newly added fund to its respective category (e.g., "Financial safety") using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **Customize Fund Details**: Click the pencil icon for each fund to input or edit specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
    *   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount available in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for this specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   **Start Date**: The date when contributions to this fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   **Target End Date**: The date by which the total emergency fund is aimed to be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Edit Fund Names**: The names of any emergency fund can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

> All elements of the template, including fund categories and details, are highly [[customization_of_asset_planning_template | customizable]] to fit individual user requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This extends to various aspects of [[customizing_budget_tracking_templates | customizing budget tracking templates]], including how [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | expense categories are customized in Notion]].

The [[introduction_to_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] requires an OpenAI API key to function and allow interaction with the chatbot itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This API key allows the chatbot to derive the exact formulas needed for Notion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Entering Your API Key
To begin, you need to copy and paste your generated API key into the designated field within the chatbot interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. After entering the key, a message will confirm that the API key has been successfully entered, and you can then proceed to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Generating an OpenAI API Key
The first step in using the chatbot is to generate an OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1.  **Access OpenAI Platform**: Click on the question mark icon within the chatbot interface, which will provide a link to generate your OpenAI key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This link will redirect you to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys**: Once on the OpenAI platform, look for "Open API Keys" in the left-hand navigation pane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
3.  **Create New Secret Key**: Click on "create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  **Enter Details**: Fill in any required details, such as a name for your key (e.g., "test key") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  **Generate Key**: Click "create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, which will generate a new unique key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

    > [!caution] Copy Immediately
    > Make sure to copy this generated key immediately and save it somewhere secure. Once you close the window, you will not be able to view this key again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## OpenAI Free Credit and Model Selection
When you create an OpenAI account, you typically receive a $5 free credit that you can use to test the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | Selecting a GPT Model]]
After entering your API key, you need to select your desired GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: This model is an older version and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The $5 free credit is limited to using the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The entire video demonstration of the chatbot utilized this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4 (0106 preview)**: This model offers better and more accurate results for every prompt and question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It is available if you are on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Chatbot Interface Navigation
If the left panel of the chat window, where you enter API keys and select models, is not visible, you can click on the arrow icon on the left side to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This is particularly useful on smartphones or other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

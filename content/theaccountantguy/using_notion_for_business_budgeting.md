[[managing_finances_using_notion | Managing finances using Notion]] for a business can be streamlined using a dedicated Notion business budget template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template helps in [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | setting and managing budgets in Notion]] by organizing business expenses and tracking them against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template features a "Business Expenses Summary" section at the top, which is divided into three key areas: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section

In the Account section, you can set up different heads of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Common categories include:
*   Operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

You can add new expense categories by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> or edit existing ones by selecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Once categories are set up, a budgeted amount is specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Expenses Section

This section allows for a quick view of current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The visual indicators help in identifying budget adherence:
*   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, displaying:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Transaction Section

The transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is where you book and manage individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Adding Expenses
*   **Quick Buttons:** Use buttons on the left, such as "Operational Expense," to quickly add a new expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Details:** After adding, you can input the description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, associate the expense with a relevant account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Date Adjustment:** Dates can be easily changed by clicking on the date field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **New Expense Source:** A "quick button" at the top allows for adding a new expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **General New Button:** The "New" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> can also be used to add expenses under different categories, allowing you to input details and budgeted amounts for new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

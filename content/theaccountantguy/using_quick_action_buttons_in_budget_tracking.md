## Types of Quick Action Buttons

### Add Transaction Button
The "Add Transaction" button allows for the rapid entry of new transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. When clicked, it automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date, prompting the user to fill in the specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This feature can be accessed from the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Add Expense Source Button
The "Add Expense Source" button facilitates the quick addition of new expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Upon clicking, it automatically adds a new expense source, initially placing it under the "fixed expenses" head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Users can then easily reorganize this newly added expense source by clicking on the three dots icon and moving it to the desired category within the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

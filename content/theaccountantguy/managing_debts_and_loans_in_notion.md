## Tracking Debt Payments
The [[tracking_debt_repayment_and_interest_in_notion | debt section]] under the "Summary" view shows all debt-related payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. This view is similar to the [[managing_accounts_for_personal_finances_in_notion | bills section]] and offers two main categories:
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Displays debts with payments due in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. This helps identify payments that are still outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Shows debts where the last payment was made in the past, indicating potential missed payments if the payment frequency suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

For each debt, the tracker displays:
*   **Next payment due date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Last payment date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Total loan amount**: The sum of the opening balance and any additional loans taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Debt paid so far** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Total repayment percentage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Customizing the Debt View
The appearance of the [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | debt tracking]] view can be customized:
*   **Layout**: Change the layout from a board view to a list or gallery format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Properties**: Enable or disable desired properties (e.g., total amount paid, repayment percentage) to be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Grouping and Sorting**: Group by payment status and sort manually to prioritize upcoming payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## General Applicability and Notion Features
The Notion finance tracker is suitable for individuals and can also be adapted for couples by splitting account categories (e.g., "Salary by Him", "Side Hustle by Her") to track finances for multiple individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

Notion is a free tool for personal use, requiring only an email ID to sign up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. It is accessible across all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

## Net Worth Tracker Overview

The Net Worth Tracker template is structured into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
*   **Get Started Section**: Here, users specify their net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Account Section**: This is where users define various accounts for personal finances, categorized into expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: This section provides an overview of all finances, displaying closing balances and proportions for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It also includes the Net Worth section, which calculates total net worth, the difference from the goal, growth, and percentage achieved against the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Transactions View**: Users feed in income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities here, which contributes to the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Customizing the Net Worth Tracker

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal
Users can begin by setting their net worth goal in the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The default is $10,000, but it can be easily edited to any desired amount, such as $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Changes made here automatically update throughout the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Managing Accounts
The "Account" section comes with default accounts, but users can add new ones or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Adding New Accounts**: To add a new account, scroll down to the desired category (e.g., Income) and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This opens a pop-up to fill in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Account Name**: Enter a name like "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, but assets and liabilities can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Classification**: Accounts can be tagged for classification (e.g., "groceries" under "bills", "Netflix" under "subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Users can select from existing tags or add their own custom categories like "Other Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency**: Define how frequently payments are received or made (e.g., "monthly" for salary, "quarterly" for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units & Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for investments (like Bitcoin, where you'd track opening units and classify as "Investments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For other accounts (income, expense, general savings), these fields can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Accounts**: Click the pencil icon next to an account to open an edit window and modify its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Recording Transactions
The "Transactions" section has four main views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Adding a Transaction**: Click "New" within any transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Date**: Select the transaction date, which automatically classifies it into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Description**: Add a brief description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   **Category**: The category is automatically set based on the view (e.g., "income" for the Income view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Link the transaction to an account created earlier (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Payment Mode**: Specify how money was received or paid (e.g., "bank account", "cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   **Transaction Type**: Select "Inflow" if money is coming into the account (income, new loan obtained, selling assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, or "Outflow" if money is leaving (expenses, paying off loans, putting money into assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   **Document**: Attach receipts or bills by embedding a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Understanding the Summary and Net Worth Calculation
After adding all transactions and accounts, the "Summary" section provides an overview of finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Finances View**: Shows current amounts for expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, including the proportion of each account to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Net Worth View**: Displays five key statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:
    *   **Net Worth Goal**: The goal set at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This can be adjusted at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as total assets minus total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Difference**: The gap between the net worth goal and the total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   **Total Growth**: The difference between the closing net worth value and the opening net worth (calculated from opening balances of assets and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of the net worth goal has been accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are continuously added, the net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Expanding Your Financial Tracking in Notion

### Upgrading to a Complete Personal Finance Tracker

This template is designed for individuals who want to track an entire range of finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, including:
*   Debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>
*   Budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>
*   Savings tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>
*   Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
*   Investments, including current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

This upgrade can be accessed via a navigation pane within the Net Worth Tracker, which includes a video overview and a link to the product page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### General Notion Customization and Support
[[customizing_notion_templates_for_business_needs | Notion also supports that]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> customization in several ways:
*   **Currency Change**: Users can change the currency from dollars to over 30 other currencies that Notion currently supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Detailed instructions are provided within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Dashboard Views**: The way the [[customizing_notion_templates_for_business_needs | entire dashboard looks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a> can be changed. For example, a board view can be switched to a gallery view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, and items can be grouped by categories like assets, expenses, income, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Notion offers significant flexibility in layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

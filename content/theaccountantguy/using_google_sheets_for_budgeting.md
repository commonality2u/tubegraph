This article details how to utilize a specific [[personal_finance_tracking_spreadsheet | personal finance tracker spreadsheet]] to manage income and expenses, designed for use in [[using_google_sheets_for_finance_tracking | Google Sheets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Structure

The [[personal_finance_tracking_spreadsheet | spreadsheet]] consists of three primary tabs:
*   **Start Here** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>: Contains necessary instructions for using the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Dashboard** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>: Provides analysis of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>: Used for recording individual income and expense transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Budget** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>: Where accounts related to income and expenses are defined, and monthly budgeted amounts are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Budget (Budget Tab)

The first step is to navigate to the **Budget** tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here, you will:
1.  **Feed Account Details**: Input the specific accounts related to your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
    *   Accounts should be categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Specify Monthly Amounts**: Define the budgeted amount for each account for every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This includes budgeted expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   The "Goal Amount" column automatically calculates the total for all months as you enter data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This column is formula-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   When adding new line items, simply drag the formula down to copy it to new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  **Add Rows**: To add more rows at the bottom of the tab, select the desired number of rows and click "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Recording Transactions (Transactions Tab)

After setting up your budget accounts, proceed to the **Transactions** tab to add individual transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For each transaction, you will input:
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Details**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Category**: Select from the accounts you defined in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Type (Income/Expense)**: Column E is formula-driven and specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense based on its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   When adding new line items, drag this formula down to apply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

This tab is crucial for [[paycheck_budget_tracking | paycheck budget tracking]] and general financial record-keeping.

## Analyzing Your Finances (Dashboard Tab)

The **Dashboard** tab provides comprehensive analysis of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. All analysis is controlled by filtering options at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   **Category**: Filter by specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Period**: Select the desired time frame (e.g., a specific year like 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Reference**: Choose to view summaries for all income/expenses or specific types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Key sections of the dashboard include:
*   **Summary Overview**: Displays total income, total expenses, and the net balance for the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Income Overview**: Details different sources of income for the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

*   **Status Callout**: Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

By adjusting the filters, you can gain insights into specific aspects of your finances, such as total income for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, or details for an individual income source like "salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

This guide provides a quick overview of how to utilize a [[benefits_of_using_a_cash_flow_template | business cash flow template]] to track your cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template includes a summary section on the left, which displays the opening balance of cash, total cash inflow, total cash outflow from all transactions, and the closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These balances automatically update as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

On the right, there are three primary sections: "About the Account Section," "Quarterly Overview," and "Business Activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts

The "Account Section" allows you to [[setting_up_accounts_for_income_and_expenses | set up different accounts]] under various heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Account Categories

The template organizes accounts into four main categories:
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   **Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

### Managing Account Items

You can either edit existing items or add new ones within each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

#### Editing Existing Items
To edit an existing asset, click the pencil icon next to the item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This allows you to change its name, for example, from an existing asset to "New Asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The same principle applies to editing items under liabilities, income, and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

#### Adding New Items
To add a new item, click the "New" button located under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Account Item Fields

When setting up or editing an account item, you can configure the following fields:

*   **Opening Balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>: This represents the starting balance of the asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For inventory, you can specify both opening units and opening balance, e.g., 10 units and $1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

*   **Classifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>: These define how a specific item is categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For example, a credit card can be classified as a "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. You can add new classifications or edit existing ones by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   **Payment Frequency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>: This specifies how often payments are received or made for a particular item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This is particularly useful for income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For instance, interest income might be specified as having a "quarterly" payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   **Opening Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>: This field is relevant for investments or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Asset Class** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>: This is primarily relevant for inventory or investments under assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Inventory items can be placed under the "inventory" asset class, and investments under the "investment" asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This article demonstrates how a specific template can be utilized to [[tracking_inventory_transactions | track inventory]] for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">00:00:05</a>. The template is organized into three main views: Inventory Setup, Inventory Portfolio, and Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio Overview

The template provides an [[managing_investments_and_inventory_in_business | inventory portfolio]] with three primary views:

*   **[[inventory_classifications_and_management | Inventory Setup]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>
*   **[[managing_investments_and_inventory_in_business | Inventory Portfolio]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">00:00:15</a>
*   **[[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | Inventory Status]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>

## Inventory Setup

The [[inventory_classifications_and_management | Inventory Setup]] section categorizes inventory into three classifications:
*   [[inventory_classifications_and_management | Raw Materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">00:00:21</a>
*   [[inventory_classifications_and_management | Work in Progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">00:00:23</a>
*   [[inventory_classifications_and_management | Finished Goods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">00:00:25</a>

For each inventory item, the following details are tracked:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">00:00:39</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle:** Options like FIFO, LIFO, and WAC are available, though they can be left as default without affecting other reporting if not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">00:00:41</a>.
*   **[[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | Reorder Level]]:** This specifies the unit level at which inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">00:00:50</a>. For example, wheat might have a [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder level]] of 60 units, and corn 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">00:00:59</a>.
*   **Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>.

To [[using_notion_templates_for_inventory_management | add an inventory]] item, click the "add inventor" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">00:01:24</a>. New items initially appear in a "no classification" window and can be moved to a specific category (e.g., Work in Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">00:01:31</a>. Values for the new item can then be entered using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">00:01:45</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio

In the [[managing_investments_and_inventory_in_business | inventory portfolio]] section, you can view:
*   The inventory value at the end of the [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction]] period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>.
*   The number of units available after all purchase and sales [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">00:02:03</a>.
*   The [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder status level]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">00:02:17</a>. If units drop below the set [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder level]], a "[[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | low stock]]" message appears, prompting to [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder this inventory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">00:02:27</a>. For example, if wheat units drop to 30 while the [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder level]] is 60, it indicates [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | low stock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>. Conversely, an item like corn with 70 units available against a 10-unit [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | reorder level]] will show as "available in Surplus," not requiring reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">00:02:50</a>. This view helps quickly determine if there are [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | sufficient units]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">00:03:08</a>.

## Inventory Status

The [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | inventory status]] section displays where inventory is currently located or its stage in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">00:03:14</a>. Statuses include:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">00:03:24</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">00:03:25</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">00:03:26</a>

Statuses are customizable and new ones can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">00:03:28</a>. The system indicates the number of items in each status; for example, "in transit" signaling "one" means one inventory item is currently in transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">00:03:45</a>. An item can be moved between statuses as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">00:04:04</a>. This helps quickly [[inventory_status_and_reorder_levels | track the inventory status]] and current location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction section]] is divided into [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | purchases]], [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | sales]], and [[income_and_expense_tracking_features | profit and loss]] for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">00:04:30</a>.

### Purchases
[[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | Purchase]] entries are organized by date, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">00:04:40</a>.
Each purchase entry includes:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">00:04:42</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">00:05:21</a>
*   Account (the specific inventory item) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">00:05:24</a>
*   Number of Units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">00:05:33</a>
*   Purchase Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">00:05:37</a>
*   Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">00:05:43</a> (which can also be edited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">00:05:51</a>

A "buy inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">00:06:03</a>.

### Sales
The [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | sales part to tap into any sales of the inventor]] functions similarly to the purchase section for recording sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">00:06:17</a>.

### Profit and Loss
For any sale made, the [[income_and_expense_tracking_features | profit and loss]] section requires entering the purchase price (or manufacturing cost) of the item sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">00:06:26</a>. The template then automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">00:06:53</a>. For example, if bread was sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, and 30 units were sold, the profit would be ($40 - $10) * 30 units = $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">00:06:59</a>.

This template helps to [[home_inventory_tracking_with_notion | track your inventory]], assign statuses, and understand its current location and financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">00:07:04</a>.

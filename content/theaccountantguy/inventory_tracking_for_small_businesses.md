This article details a template designed to help small businesses track their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It provides a comprehensive system for managing stock, tracking transactions, and monitoring profitability.

## Inventory Portfolio

The template features an [[inventory_setup_and_classifications | Inventory Portfolio]] with three primary views: Inventory Setup, Inventory Portfolio, and Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Inventory Setup

The Inventory Setup section allows for the classification of inventory into three categories: raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For each inventory item, the following details can be recorded:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units:** The initial quantity of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Principle:** Options like FIFO, LIFO, and WSC valuation principles are available, but can be left as is if not understood, as it won't affect reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level:** The unit quantity at which a reorder should be triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, a reorder level of 60 units for wheat means that if the stock drops below 60 units, a reorder is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a specific inventory item compared to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

New inventory items can be added by clicking the "add inventor" button, which initially places them in a "no classification" window. They can then be moved to the appropriate category (raw materials, work in progress, or finished goods) and their values updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Inventory Portfolio View

This section displays the inventory value and the number of units available at the end of a transaction period, after all purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It also provides a reorder status, indicating whether stock is low or in surplus based on the set reorder levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For instance, if wheat stock drops to 30 units with a reorder level of 60, it will display a "low stock" message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Conversely, 70 units of corn with a 10-unit reorder level will indicate surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Inventory Status

The [[asset_maintenance_tracking | Inventory Status]] view tracks the current location or status of inventory items, such as "in transit," "in progress," or "not sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. These statuses can be customized or new ones added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The view shows how many inventory items are in each status; for example, one item being "in transit" means a purchase is on its way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Items can be moved between statuses as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Transactions Section

The transactions section is straightforward, managing purchases, sales, and calculating profit and loss for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases

Purchase transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For each purchase, users can:
*   Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Select the specific inventory account (e.g., wheat, corn, bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   Enter the number of units purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Input the purchase price, which automatically calculates the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Assign an inventory status for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
A "buy inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase entry for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Sales

The sales section functions similarly to purchases, allowing users to track inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit & Loss

For each sale, the profit and loss section requires the input of the item's purchase or manufacturing cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For example, if bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, the template calculates the profit (e.g., $30 profit per unit multiplied by 30 units equals $900 profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This feature enables users to effectively [[tracking_and_summarizing_business_finances | track and summarize business finances]] related to inventory.

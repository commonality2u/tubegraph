This article details how to [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | generate PDF documents]] from Notion using the [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | PDF Output]] tool, demonstrated with a boarding pass example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The process allows for [[generating_pdfs_in_bulk_with_notion | generating PDFs in bulk]] from Notion database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To [[integrating_notion_with_pdf_output_for_document_creation | integrate Notion with PDF Output for document creation]], you need:
*   A Notion database containing the details to be exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For a boarding pass example, this database holds all the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A Notion template designed for the PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This template dictates the layout and content of the final PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Process for Generating PDFs

The steps to [[bulk_generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | bulk generate PDF documents from a Notion database]] using [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | PDF Output]] are as follows:

1.  **Access [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | PDF Output]]**: Input "boarding pass" into the connection details of the [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | PDF Output]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database**: Select the "boarding pass database" to establish a connection with the Notion data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Select Template**: Choose the "boarding pass template" from which the PDFs will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to initiate the loading of all information from both the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents**: Once the information is loaded, click "export" to begin [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_using_pdfoutput | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Output and Management

After the export process is complete:
*   The export status will show as successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   You can preview a sample to confirm that the [[creating_pdf_documents_with_notion_templates | generated PDF]] contains all the details from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The generated files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Multiple PDF files are generated, each corresponding to a unique entry in the database, with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This method allows for [[exporting_notion_data_to_pdf | exporting Notion data to PDF]] and [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_files_from_notion_database | managing PDF files from a Notion database]] efficiently, useful for tasks like [[generating_professional_invoice_pdfs_using_notion | generating professional invoice PDFs using Notion]] or, as shown, boarding passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The minus sign (`-`) can be used in Notion to find the difference between two numbers within a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This method is an alternative to using the [[subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Setup for Finding Differences

To find the difference between numbers, you will first need to set up a database:
1.  Create a database using a forward slash followed by "database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  Assign a title property to signify the purpose of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Assign the [[properties_of_numbers_in_notion | properties of numbers]] to two different numbers that you intend to calculate the difference from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Using the Minus Sign in Formulas

After setting up your database with number properties, you can use the minus sign within a [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] property to compute the difference:
*   Similar to the [[subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]], the minus sign can be used in a formula to find the difference between two given numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   For example, if you have "Number 1" and "Number 2" as your number properties, a formula using the minus sign would be `prop("Number 1") - prop("Number 2")` to obtain their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This method allows you to easily find the difference between two numbers in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

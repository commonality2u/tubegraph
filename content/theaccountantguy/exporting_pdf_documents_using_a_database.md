Businesses can [[syncing_and_exporting_documents_using_pdf_output | sync and export documents using PDF output]] through a service like PDF Output.com, which is designed to help create professional PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>. This platform streamlines the process of [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | generating PDF documents]] from structured data, offering both single and bulk export capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:98">[03:14:98]</a>.

## Single PDF Generation

Upon logging into the platform, users can access an interface that allows them to select a template from a dropdown menu, such as an invoice template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a>. Users can also select their preferred currency from several available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

To [[steps_to_set_up_and_export_pdfs_using_pdf_output | set up and export PDFs]], users fill in the necessary details directly into the form fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. As information is entered, the PDF populates in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:78">[02:18:78]</a>. Once all details are filled, clicking "Download PDF" automatically generates the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>. The generated PDF reflects all the entered information, including the selected currency, which can be changed at any time to re-populate the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:30">[03:04:30]</a>.

## Bulk PDF Export Mode

For [[automating_document_exports_using_pdf_output | automating document exports]] and [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | generating sales receipts as PDF documents]] or other documents in larger quantities, the platform offers a "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:98">[03:19:98]</a>. This mode allows users to input multiple records into a database-like interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:26">[03:24:26]</a>.

### Process of Bulk Generation

1.  **Fill the Database**: Users fill in details for each document (e.g., invoice number, invoice date, customer details, product information) into rows within the provided database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:55">[04:06:55]</a>.
2.  **Generate PDFs**: Once the database is populated, clicking "Download all PDF" initiates the generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The system generates PDF documents one by one based on the information in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Review Output**: The generated PDFs maintain the same format as those created in single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Currency selection from the main interface will also apply to the bulk-generated documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Users also have the flexibility to [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_documents | export individual PDF documents]] for a specific row by clicking the "Download PDF" option associated with that row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:27">[05:00:27]</a>.

### Future Developments

Currently, the platform supports a "live database" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:95">[04:45:95]</a>. Future updates will include a [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion_databases | Notion database feature]], allowing users to add details to their Notion databases and then [[exporting_documents_from_a_notion_database | export documents]] directly from the PDF Output platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The platform plans to add more templates and welcomes user feedback for new template requests or feature suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

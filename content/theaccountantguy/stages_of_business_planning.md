This article outlines how to utilize a [[business_plan_template_in_notion | business plan template]] to streamline business planning, focusing on its structured approach to managing different stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template offers two primary views: the Business Plan Roadmap and the [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap organizes the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template comes with 11 pre-defined stages, each named to describe its focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Common stages include:
*   Conception & Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning & Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability & Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Users can edit these stages using a pencil icon to customize the roadmap for their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For each stage, objectives can be defined, and the corresponding business plan stage can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Task Management within Business Stages

Clicking on any stage within the Business Plan Roadmap reveals a detailed view, showcasing the [[task_management_within_business_stages | different tasks associated with that stage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For instance, the "Conception & Research" stage might have two specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

For each task, the following details can be managed:
*   **Deadline**: The date by which the task is expected to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark a task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status Assignment**: Users can assign a status to the task based on its progress or requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added to any stage using a dedicated "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Additionally, a documentation section at the bottom allows for detailed specification of objectives and tasks for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Tracking Completion Status

The template features an automated [[updating_completion_status_in_business_planning | completion percentage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. When a task is marked as complete using its checkbox, the overall completion percentage for that stage is automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the status will show 50% completion; completing both tasks updates it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This percentage is visible at the top of the stage's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] view provides a chronological overview of all planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It displays specific deadline dates for tasks, showing the timeline set for various stages, such as December 3 to December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

For each entry in the timeline, the following information is displayed:
*   Stage name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   Associated task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>

This view offers a quick summary of all planned items and their progress, with arrows indicating specific dates and allowing users to navigate to detailed stage information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

A business plan template can be utilized to facilitate the planning process for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template typically includes two primary views: the Business Plan Roadmap and the Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap view organises the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The template provides 11 predefined stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These stages range from "Conceptional Research" and "Planning and Structuring" to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Users can edit these stages to fit their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

For each stage, users can:
*   Define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Specify the corresponding business plan stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Track the completion status in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This directly relates to [[tracking_completion_status_in_business_plans | tracking completion status in business plans]].

### Managing Tasks within Stages

Clicking on a specific stage in the roadmap reveals its detailed view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Within this view, various tasks are associated with that particular stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

For each task, the following details can be managed:
*   **Deadline**: The date by which the task is expected to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark a task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status Assignment**: Once a task is marked complete, a status can be assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

New tasks can be added for any stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Additionally, a documentation section is available at the bottom where objectives and tasks can be described in greater detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Tracking Progress

As tasks are marked complete, the template automatically updates the overall completion percentage for that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Completing both tasks would result in 100% completion for that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all the planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This provides a visual overview of deadlines and timelines for various stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The timeline displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The name of the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Tasks associated with each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   The status of the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

This view provides a quick [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | timeline view]] of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Arrows on the timeline reflect the dates for all specified stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Clicking on these arrows navigates to the specific date and displays details of the stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Overall, this [[business_plan_template_in_notion | business plan template in Notion]] provides a structured approach to planning and managing business stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This simple Notion template helps users [[home_inventory_tracking_using_notion | keep track of all home inventory]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It's designed to provide an overview of estimated vs. actual purchases and detailed tracking of consumption and availability for various items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is divided into several key sections:

### Financial Summary
On the left side of the dashboard, users can find a summary of their purchasing:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

### Inventory Sections
The right side of the template features three primary sections for managing inventory details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

#### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to [[inventory_setup_and_classification | set up different categories for their home inventory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of predefined categories include:
*   Dairy & Eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Fruits & Veggies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Under each main category, users can see subcategories along with their estimated budgeted purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

#### Inventory Overview
The inventory overview provides key metrics for tracking items:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   The percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

These metrics are applicable to all listed subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

#### Transaction Section
The transaction section is where users record all inventory movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Users can specify inventory transactions, such as a cheese purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Clicking on an entry reveals subcategory items, purchased inventory items, and the amount of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Entries can also be added for consumption, detailing the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   All transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template, providing real-time tracking of available inventory and consumption needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The [[notion_template_for_employee_payment_tracking | Notion employee paycheck tracker]] is a simple template designed to help keep track of all employee payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01"></a>. It is divided into three main sections: Records, Payments, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>.

## Records Section

The Records section displays all details about the employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. It is a complete record of all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>, including:
*   Whether they are permanent employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.
*   The payments due to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>.
*   The number of months of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>.
*   How they are paid (monthly or hourly basis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>.
*   The amount of payment being paid to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a>.

Users can add a new employee by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33"></a>, add a new category by clicking "plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>, and edit existing employee departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.

Anath Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to use a travel expense tracker to monitor and plan for travel-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tracker, implied to be a [[setting_up_a_travel_expense_tracker_in_notion | Notion]] template, provides a comprehensive overview of expenditures against budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Summary Section

The tracker's summary section offers an overview of expenses, categorized by accounts and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Accounts View: Setting Up Expense Categories

This view allows users to classify expenses into predefined categories such as travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. All incurred expenses are recorded under one of these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

To quickly add a new expense source:
1.  Click "add expense source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This automatically adds a new source to the "Travel" category initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon to [[editing_and_reviewing_travel_expenses | edit]] the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, changing "Expense Source" to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  Set a budgeted amount for the new expense source, such as $1,500 for Metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Expense sources can be moved between existing categories by clicking the three dots next to them and placing them under the desired section, such as "Meals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Existing expense sources can also be [[editing_and_reviewing_travel_expenses | edited]] via the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Each expense source has a set budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Users can also create entirely new top-level categories (groups) by clicking the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Existing groups can be [[editing_and_reviewing_travel_expenses | edited]] by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This enables [[using_categories_for_effective_expense_management | effective categorization]].

### Expenses View: Tracking Against Budget

This section displays the total expenses incurred, the budgeted expense set for each category, and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Exceeding Budget**: If an expense exceeds its budget, like a $2,000 flight expense against a $1,000 budget, it shows as 200% and is indicated in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Within Budget**: If an expense is within budget, like $100 for breakfast against a $300 budget, it shows as 33% and is indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This view provides a quick glance at where expenses stand relative to the budget, facilitating [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | tracking expenses against a budget]] and [[expense_categorization_and_analysis | expense categorization and analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The overall summary provides a complete overview of all budgeted expenses, total expenses incurred, and the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It also calculates the total expenses as a percentage of the total budgeted amount, for example, 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Booking Expenses (Transaction Entry)

The tracker also facilitates the booking of expenses under the same three categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

To add a specific expense:
1.  Use the quick addition buttons, such as "Add Travel Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
2.  This adds a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  Input details:
    *   **Description**: A brief note about the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info**: Details about the trip, e.g., "Trip to Paris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Existing trip info can be [[editing_and_reviewing_travel_expenses | edited]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Select the specific type of expense within the category, e.g., "Train" for a travel expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the cost of the expense, e.g., $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it immediately updates the expenses summary. For instance, a $100 train expense will reflect under the "Train" account in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted amount is set for "Train" (e.g., $200), the summary will show 50% spent in green, indicating it's within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This process utilizes the [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | transaction section]] for detailed expense recording.

Quick navigation buttons facilitate adding expenses under different views, such as "Add Lodging Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This comprehensive template allows users to track where expenses stand and plan accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

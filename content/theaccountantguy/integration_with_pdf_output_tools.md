## Overview
PDF Output is a tool designed to generate PDF documents in bulk by integrating with Notion templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process involves replacing elements within a Notion template with corresponding data from a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Getting Started with PDFOutput.com

### Logging In
To begin, navigate to PDFOutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> and log in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. After successful login, the interface will prompt you to connect a Notion database and a Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Accessing Templates and Databases
Before connecting, it's recommended to visit the template section on PDF Output to locate and duplicate the necessary templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Each template often includes a corresponding database link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For example, the payment receipt template has an associated database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Duplicating Templates and Databases to Notion
The first step is to duplicate both the template and the database onto your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is done by clicking "Duplicate" on the template and database links from PDFOutput.com's template section and selecting your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Connecting Notion to PDFOutput.com
Once the template and database are duplicated in your Notion workspace, return to PDF Output and click "Click here to add database" or "Add template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This will prompt a request for permission to access your Notion pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Select your Notion workspace and the specific template and database pages you duplicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. After allowing access, PDF Output will authenticate and connect the chosen Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **Note**: If the database or template doesn't load immediately, click "refresh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Mapping Data to Templates
After connecting, provide a connection name (e.g., "payment receipts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. PDF Output will then load the database properties and template elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Automatic Mapping
The tool automatically maps database properties to template elements if the naming conventions (including spaces and capitalization) are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. For example, if `{Company website}` is used in the template, a database column named "Company website" will be automatically mapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Manual Mapping
If there is a mismatch in naming, properties will appear unmapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. You can manually map these by searching for the corresponding element from the database properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The interface also includes filter options (e.g., for unmapped or mapped properties), search functionality, and sorting options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Generating and Exporting PDFs
Once all elements are correctly mapped, click "Create PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The tool will read the database rows and the template to generate PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For instance, three database rows will result in three PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

After successful export, you can [[using_pdf_output_for_document_export_and_preview | preview a sample PDF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> or [[managing_and_exporting_pdfs_with_pdfoutput | download all documents]] as a ZIP file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The generated PDFs will accurately populate all fields from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Managing Connections and Settings

### Saved Connections
The "Connections" section in the sidebar displays a list of previously created connections used to generate PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Clicking on a saved connection will automatically load the associated database and template in the first step, eliminating the need to manually re-add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Adding More Templates and Databases
To add more templates and databases after the initial setup, navigate to the "Settings" section and select "Click here to add templates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Template Library
The "Templates" section provides a library of various templates for different use cases, including [[using_pdf_output_to_generate_invoices | invoices]] and other documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Custom Templates
For users who prefer not to use predefined templates and databases, PDF Output supports [[custom_pdf_document_solutions | custom PDF document solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Instructions on how to utilize a custom PDF document format are available in the "Help" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Subscription and Features
PDF Output offers an "Upgrade" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The free plan includes a "Made with PDF Output" watermark on generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Upgrading to a [[subscription_and_features_of_pdf_output_services | paid plan]] removes this watermark and provides higher limits for PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Users can review plans and activate their subscription through this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Within "Settings", users can also define the page format for their PDFs, with A4 being the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Support
For questions or feedback, a dedicated "Feedback" window is available in the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Users can send messages for assistance with any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

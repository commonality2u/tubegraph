Notion templates can be highly beneficial for businesses, allowing for efficient tracking and management of various operations. The [[customizing_notion_templates | customization of Notion templates]] enables users to adapt them precisely to their specific business requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Product Order Tracker Template

A "Products Order Tracker" is a simple Notion template designed to keep tabs on all products ordered by customers for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Key Data Points Tracked
The template's database includes essential details for each order:
*   **Product Details** Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Customer Information** Customer's name, billing address, phone number, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Source** How the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Gift Item Status** Whether the product is intended as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Order Amount** The total cost of the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Order Summary & Analytics
At the top of the template, an order summary provides key metrics:
*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Number of orders placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   Number of customers who placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Percentage of orders marked as gift items (e.g., 67%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This percentage dynamically updates with changes to the gift status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Breakdown of payment sources, showing the number of customers and respective percentages for each method (e.g., debit card, PayPal, credit card, other) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Customization for Business Needs
This Notion template is [[customizing_notion_templates | entirely customizable]] to suit specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Users can add:
*   Average order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   Other necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   The database can also be expanded to include additional items and details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## PDF Document Generation for Business

Beyond Notion, external tools can also play a role in managing business documents. PDFoutput.com is a platform designed to create PDF documents, such as invoices, for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Features
*   **Template Selection** Users can select a specific template, such as an [[customizing_notion_invoice_templates | invoice template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Currency Options** Multiple currency options are available, and selecting a preferred currency automatically populates the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Data Entry** Details related to the invoice can be filled in, and the PDF will populate with the corresponding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **PDF Download** A generated PDF document can be downloaded instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Bulk Export Mode
For businesses needing to generate multiple PDF documents, a bulk export mode is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Users can fill in a database with invoice details, and the tool will generate PDFs one by one based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This feature supports exporting PDFs for individual rows or all rows simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Future Notion Integration
There are plans to add a Notion database feature, allowing users to add details to their Notion database and then export documents from PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, further enhancing [[customizing_notion_templates_for_pdf_documents | customization for PDF documents]] by linking Notion data directly.

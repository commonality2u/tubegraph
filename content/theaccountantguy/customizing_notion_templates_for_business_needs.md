Notion templates can be [[customizing_notion_templates|customized]] to suit various business needs, offering flexible solutions for tracking and managing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a>.

## Product Order Tracker Template

A "products aut tracker" is a simple [[customizing_notion_templates|Notion template]] designed to help businesses keep track of all customer orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a>.

### Database Structure
The template includes a database with comprehensive details for each order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>:
*   **Product Details** The product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>.
*   **Customer Information** Includes the customer's name, billing address, phone number, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>.
*   **Payment Sources** Specifies how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>.
*   **Gift Item Indicator** Notes whether the product is being sent as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a>.
*   **Order Amount** The total amount for the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>.

### Order Summary Features
At the top of the template, an order summary section provides key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>:
*   **Total Order Value** Displays the sum of all orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36"></a>.
*   **Total Orders Placed** The count of all orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>.
*   **Number of Customers** The total count of customers who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>.
*   **Gift Recommendation Percentage** Shows the percentage of customers looking to send products as gift items, which dynamically updates with changes in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>.
*   **Payment Source Breakdown** Illustrates how many customers are paying through various methods like debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other sources, along with their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a>.

### Customization and Expansion
This Notion template is fully [[customizing_notion_templates|customizable]] to fit specific business requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a>. Users can add additional metrics such as average order value and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>. The database can also be expanded to include more items or details as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>.

For assistance in tracking more details within the products order tracker, individuals can reach out via email at notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35"></a>.

## PDF Document Generation

While not a Notion template, a separate solution called PDFoutput.com allows businesses to create PDF documents, such as invoices, from templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47"></a>. This tool enables users to select a template (e.g., an invoice template), choose a currency, and fill in details to generate a PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11"></a>. The generated PDF automatically populates with the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48"></a>.

### Bulk PDF Export
The platform also supports a bulk export mode, allowing users to fill in a database and generate multiple PDF documents simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17"></a>. Currently, this feature supports a live database, with plans to integrate a Notion database feature in the future, which would allow exporting documents directly from a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49"></a>.

Users can also generate a PDF for a single row within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00"></a>.

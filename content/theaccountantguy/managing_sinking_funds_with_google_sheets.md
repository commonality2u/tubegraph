A personal finance tracker developed in [[using_google_sheets_for_finance | Google Sheets]] offers a dedicated tab for [[sinking_funds_tracker | Sinking Fund Analysis]], enabling users to effectively manage and track their savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool helps visualize total contributions made and remaining contributions for various [[types_of_sinking_funds_for_personal_finance | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Sinking Funds Analysis Tab

The [[sinking_funds_tracker | Sinking Funds Tracker]] tab operates with an approach similar to a monthly budget, focusing on dynamic updates based on user inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Setting Up Sinking Funds

To begin [[tracking_savings_goals_with_a_sinking_funds_tracker | tracking savings goals with a Sinking Funds Tracker]], users need to specify several key details for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>:
*   **Fund Name**: Define each [[types_of_sinking_funds_for_personal_finance | sinking fund]] you wish to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: Set a target amount for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For example, a home renovation fund might have a $5,000 target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Monthly Contribution**: Specify the amount you intend to contribute monthly to each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. For the home renovation example, this could be $400 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Starting Fund Amount**: Input any initial savings already allocated to a particular fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. For instance, if you already have $2,800 saved for home renovation, this can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Tracking Contributions and Progress

Once details are entered, the system automatically calculates and displays several metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:
*   **Amount Saved So Far**: This figure updates based on entries made in the transaction area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Amount Left**: Shows how much more needs to be saved to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Total Progress**: Calculated as total savings divided by the set goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Estimated Completion Date**: Provides an estimated date and number of months until the fund goal is met, assuming consistent monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Contributions are logged by entering the date, selecting the appropriate fund from a dropdown menu, and inputting the amount for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Visual Overview

The [[sinking_funds_tracker | Sinking Funds Tracker]] provides a clear overview of all [[google_sheet_for_sinking_funds | Google Sheet for Sinking Funds]] goals, total savings achieved, and remaining savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. A quick graph visually represents progress, with a green bar indicating total savings made and a black bar showing the savings still needed for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This visual aid helps users quickly assess their savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Integration with Dynamic Reporting

The [[google_sheet_for_sinking_funds | Google Sheet for Sinking Funds]] data is integrated into the general reporting section of the personal finance tracker, allowing for [[dynamic_financial_reporting_with_google_sheets | dynamic financial reporting with Google Sheets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can select "sinking fund details" from a dropdown and specify a month to view a quick pie chart reflecting the total division and allocation of funds for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This dynamic feature allows for quick analysis of finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

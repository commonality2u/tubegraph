This guide demonstrates how to set up [[automating_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | debt payment reminders]] that arrive as notifications on [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These notifications are received on the loan's due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Example of a Debt Payment Reminder

An example notification for a car loan due on September 23 for an amount of $3,000 would appear as a debt payment reminder alert on [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The message would state: "Hi there, this is a reminder for payment of car loan which is due on September 23 for an amount of three thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The reminder message includes a "Pay Now" button or link that can redirect you to your bank portal or any specified payment link (e.g., PayPal) to repay the loan instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Setting Up Recurring Payment Reminders

To receive [[automating_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | debt payment reminders]] on your [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]], you first need to create a [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Creating a New Loan Template
1.  Access the template creation option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Input loan details, such as the loan type (e.g., "car loan") and the repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | Scheduling Repeating Notifications]]
For each new [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]], there is an option to set up repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This feature automatically populates all the values within the template for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

To set up monthly repetitions:
1.  Select "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  Specify the day of the month for the reminder to be added to the database (e.g., the 16th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  Set a specific time and time zone for the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
4.  Save the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Adjusting Notification Date Relative to Due Date
You can customize when you receive the notification relative to the actual loan due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   To receive a notification seven days before the due date, input "7" in the "days" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, if the due date is September 23, the notification would be received on September 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   To receive the notification on the same date as the due date, set the value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Once a recurring [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] is set for each loan, it will automatically trigger an automation to send the payment notification message to your [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Automation in Action
When a new loan entry is automatically added based on the [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] (e.g., an education loan scheduled for 3:55 PM on September 16), a payment alert message will be triggered and sent to your [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Customization and Management
This system can be automated for any number of loans you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The reminder messages are fully [[customizing_reminder_messages_and_payment_details | customizable]] to your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Once a loan has been repaid, you can simply delete its corresponding [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | template]] to stop further recurring notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

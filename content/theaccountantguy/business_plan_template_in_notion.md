The Business Plan Template in Notion is a tool designed to assist in planning for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template helps users manage various aspects of business planning and track progress effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It is an example of [[creating_and_using_notion_templates | creating and using Notion templates]] for specific business needs and can be used for [[using_notion_for_business_tracking | business tracking]].

## Key Views

The template offers two primary views to organize and visualize your business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
1.  Business Plan Roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
2.  Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

### Business Plan Roadmap

This view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The template pre-defines 11 stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Examples of stages include:
*   Conceptional Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

Users can customize or edit these stages using an edit icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

#### Defining Objectives and Tasks

Within each stage, users can define specific objectives for the business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Each objective can be linked to its corresponding stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Associated with each stage are various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For each task, the following details can be specified:
*   **Deadline:** When the task is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Completion Status:** A checkbox indicates if a task is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Task Status:** Users can assign a specific status to each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Adding New Tasks:** New tasks can be added for any specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

#### Documentation and Progress Tracking

At the bottom of each stage's detailed view, there is a documentation section where objectives and tasks can be described in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the completion percentage for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. When tasks are marked as complete, this percentage updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, if two tasks are defined and one is completed, the stage shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all planned stages and tasks in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This view shows:
*   Specific deadline dates for stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The timeline set for specific stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   The stage name and associated tasks for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Dates and status for each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Arrows within the timeline reflect the dates, and clicking them navigates to the specific date and shows details of all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

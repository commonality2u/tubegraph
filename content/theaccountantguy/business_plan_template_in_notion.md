The business plan template in Notion is designed to help organize and streamline the planning process for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It offers two main views: the Business Plan Roadmap and the Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template comes with 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, including:
*   Conception and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

You can customize these stages by clicking on the pencil icon to edit the roadmap as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Tracking Progress
For each business plan, you can define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, specify which stage the plan corresponds to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, and track a completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Stage Details and Task Management
Clicking on any stage in the roadmap reveals a detailed view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Here, you'll find:
*   **Associated Tasks**: Tasks specific to that stage, for example, "Conception and Research" might have two tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Deadlines**: A specified deadline for each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Status**: A checkbox to mark tasks as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Task Status**: An option to assign a status (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Adding New Tasks**: A "New" icon allows you to add additional tasks for the specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Documentation**: A section at the bottom for detailed objectives and tasks, providing more information about that stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Completion Percentage Update
As tasks are marked as complete within a stage, the completion percentage for that stage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the status will show 50% complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Completing both tasks will update it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This percentage is visible at the top of the stage view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all the planned stages and tasks in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This view displays:
*   **Specific Deadline Dates**: Shows the timeline set for each stage, such as "December 3 to December 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Stage Name and Associated Task**: Displays the stage name and tasks linked to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Date and Status**: Includes the dates and current status for each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

This view provides a quick overview of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Arrows on the timeline also reflect dates, and clicking on them will take you to the specific date and show details of all stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

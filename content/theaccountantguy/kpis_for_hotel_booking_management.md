The Notion hotel booking forms tracker is designed to help users efficiently monitor hotel reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It includes a simple [[using_notion_for_hotel_booking_tracking | Notion template]] that automatically updates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the top of the dashboard based on data entered in the booking table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The tracker features two primary KPIs displayed at the top of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

1.  **Bookings by Room Type**: This KPI shows the number of bookings made for various room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Below each room type, it indicates the number of guests who have booked that specific room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Free Pickup Requests**: This KPI provides information on guests requiring free pickup services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It displays a count of guests who have requested free pickup (Yes) and those who have not (No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

These KPIs were specifically added to the database for tracking purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Hotel Booking Tracker Components

The core of the system is a simple table at the bottom, where detailed booking information can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The table includes the following columns:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request**: A field for any specific requests from the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is a placeholder text and can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date**: This column includes the date, and can be optionally updated to include a specific arrival time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: Similar to the arrival date, this column can also include the departure time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Room Type**: Users can select from pre-defined room types or add new ones, which automatically create a new category and update the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Guest Count**: This field allows recording the number of guests for a reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. By default, it is not displayed in the top KPIs but can be added with customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup**: A 'Yes' or 'No' option to indicate if a guest requires free pickup, which automatically updates the free pickup summary KPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Customization

The hotel booking template is entirely [[customizing_hotel_booking_templates_in_notion | customizable]] to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This includes:

*   Adding time to arrival or departure dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Creating new room types, which automatically generates a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Adjusting the display of the guest count KPI at the top of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

*   **Actual Purchases** The total actual purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Difference** The variance between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Purchase Percentage** The percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

This article explains how to manage and track personal finances, specifically debt, savings, and recurring bills, using a Notion-based personal finance tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The system utilizes three main sections: an "Account" section for initial setup, a "Transaction" section for recording financial movements, and a "Summary" section for an overview and tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

This guide explains how to utilize a [[creating_a_business_plan_using_notion | business plan template]] to streamline business planning, focusing on the assignment and tracking of tasks and deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template offers two primary views: the [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan road map]] and the [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Business Plan Roadmap

The [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan road map]] organizes the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
Initially, 11 stages are pre-defined, ranging from "conceptual research" to "profitability and scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These stages are fully customizable, allowing users to edit them as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Setting Objectives and Stages
For each business plan, objectives can be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These objectives are then linked to the specific stage of the business plan they correspond to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Assigning Tasks and Deadlines
Within each stage of the [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan road map]], specific tasks can be associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For every task, a deadline can be set, indicating when it is expected to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The template includes:
*   **Tasks**: Individual actions required for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Deadline**: The date by which a task should be finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Completion Status**: A checkbox to mark a task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status**: Allows assigning a specific status (e.g., "Not started," "In progress," "Completed") based on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be easily added to any stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Additionally, a documentation section allows for detailed descriptions of objectives and tasks for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Tracking Completion Percentage
The template automatically calculates the completion percentage for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. When a task's completion checkbox is marked, the overall completion percentage for that stage is automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion percentage will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Events Timeline

The [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] provides a visual, calendar, and timeline format view of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The timeline set for specific stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Stage names and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The date and status of each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The timeline offers a quick overview of all planned items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, with arrows indicating specific dates and allowing navigation to view details for all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

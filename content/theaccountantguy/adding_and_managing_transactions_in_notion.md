The savings funds tracker includes a transactions panel where users can [[entering_and_categorizing_transactions_in_notion | enter and categorize transactions]] related to their savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>. This panel is dynamic and automatically updates the overall savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:11">[03:53:11]</a>.

## Adding New Transactions

To add a new transaction:
1.  Navigate to the transactions panel at the bottom of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>.
2.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>.
3.  A new transaction entry will automatically appear with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:60">[02:44:60]</a>.

## Editing Transaction Details

Once a transaction is added, you can edit its details:
1.  **Date:** Click on the date field to open a calendar window and select a different date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.
2.  **Description:** Enter a description for the transaction, such as "saving for car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:80">[03:17:80]</a>.
3.  **Saving Fund:** Select the relevant [[Creating and managing a database in Notion|saving fund]] from the dropdown menu that appears when you click on the "Saving Fund" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:98">[03:22:98]</a>. This list includes all [[Creating and managing a database in Notion|saving funds]] previously set up in the savings target view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:60">[03:24:60]</a>.
4.  **Saving Amount:** Input the amount saved for this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:85">[03:31:85]</a>. This amount will automatically contribute to the total savings for the selected fund in the savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:45">[03:38:45]</a>.

> [!INFO] Currency Settings
> The currency displayed for amounts can be changed. Click on any amount with a dollar currency, then select "Edit property" and choose a different number format from the "Number format" options that Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:41">[04:09:41]</a>. Assistance is available for setting up the template with a different currency post-purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Viewing and Grouping Transactions

The transactions panel organizes entries:
*   Transactions are split and displayed by different months, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>.
*   This view is customizable. By default, transactions are grouped by date (month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>.
*   To change the grouping, click the three dots on the transaction view, select "Group," and then choose to group by "week" or "year" instead of "month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:75">[04:51:75]</a>. The view will dynamically change to reflect the chosen grouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:29">[05:01:29]</a>.

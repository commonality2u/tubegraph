[[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF Output.com]] is a platform designed to help businesses [[generating_pdf_documents_for_business_needs | create and export PDF documents]] for various business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It offers features for both single document generation and [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents_using_pdf_output | bulk export of PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Key Features

Upon logging into PDF Output.com, users are presented with an interface that allows for template selection and detailed input for document generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Single PDF Mode

In the single PDF mode, users can generate individual PDF documents by filling in specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **Template Selection**: Users can select a specific template from a dropdown menu, such as an [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_invoices | invoice template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Currency Configuration**: The platform allows users to choose their preferred currency from several available options, such as USD or Euro, which will be reflected in the generated document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Data Entry**: Details related to the document (e.g., invoice information) can be filled into the corresponding fields. As data is entered, it populates the PDF preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Document Generation and Download**: Once all details are entered, a "Download PDF" button automatically [[exporting_and_downloading_pdfs | generates and downloads the PDF document]] based on the information provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Bulk Export Mode

For businesses requiring multiple documents, the bulk export mode streamlines the process of [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents_using_pdf_output | generating PDF documents in bulk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

*   **Database Input**: Users can fill in a database or table with details for multiple documents (e.g., several invoices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Columns are expandable for better visibility of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Bulk Download**: After populating the database, clicking "Download all PDF" initiates the generation and download of multiple PDF documents, one for each row of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Individual Row Export**: It is also possible to [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents | export a PDF document]] for a particular row by clicking on the "Download PDF" option specific to that individual row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The generated PDF documents maintain the format and currency selected, consistent with single PDF mode outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The platform currently supports a live database feature and will soon add a Notion database integration to allow exporting documents from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Customization and Future Development

The platform is designed to be customizable to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Users can request new templates or provide feedback on desired features through dedicated links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

This guide outlines the process of [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | generating PDF documents from a Notion database]] and subsequently downloading and extracting them. The example used demonstrates creating boarding pass PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Generating PDF Documents

To begin [[creating_pdf_documents_from_a_notion_database | creating PDF documents from a Notion database]], you first need to connect to your Notion database and select a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. The demonstration uses a "boarding pass database" containing details for boarding passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> and a "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The process involves [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | using a PDF output tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, which loads information from the database and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. Once the information is loaded, you can proceed to export the documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. Hitting "export" initiates the process of [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdf_output | generating PDF documents in bulk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

After successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>, you can [[exporting_and_previewing_pdf_documents_generated_in_notion | preview a sample]] to ensure the boarding pass has been generated with all the correct details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Downloading and Extracting Files

Once the PDF documents have been generated:

1.  **Download the files**: You can proceed to download the generated files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.
2.  **Extract the files**: After the files are downloaded, you can extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Open and review**: Once extracted, you can open the individual PDF files to view their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. The example shows multiple PDF outputs, each with different names and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.

This process demonstrates how to utilize a PDF output tool to generate and manage PDF documents directly from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.

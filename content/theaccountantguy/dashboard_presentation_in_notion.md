This article details the [[customizing_notion_dashboard_for_personal_finances | presentation of an income tracker dashboard]] within Notion, which helps users stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The minimalistic design requires five specific databases to be built first, including:
*   Income Details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Income Source database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Frequency of Income database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Total Earnings database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Period database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

The income tracker [[setting_up_a_primary_dashboard_in_notion | primary dashboard]] organizes information into four key sections for effective [[customizing_data_presentation_in_notion | data presentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
*   Total Earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Sources of Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Frequency of Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Overview Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

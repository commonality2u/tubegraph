This guide explains how to generate payment receipt PDF documents in bulk using a Notion database and a Notion template with PDFOutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Generation Process

### 1. Accessing PDFOutput and Templates
Begin by logging in to PDFOutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Once logged in, navigate to the "Templates" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Here, you'll find a list of available templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Utilize the search option to find the "Payment Receipts PDF Generator" template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Sorting and filtering options are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Click on the "download link" next to the "Payment Receipts PDF Generator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This will open a new page featuring both the Notion database and the Notion template for payment receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### 2. Understanding the Notion Database and Template
The Notion template contains predefined elements, with some enclosed in curly braces (e.g., `{receipt number}`, `{receipt date}`, `{customer name}`, `{customer email}`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These curly-braced items are "placeholder text elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

These placeholders will be automatically replaced by corresponding data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, the `{customer name}` placeholder in the template will be populated by data from the "customer name" column in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It's crucial that the placeholder names in the template exactly match the column names in your Notion database for proper syncing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### 3. Duplicating the Template to Notion
If the template is not yet published to the Notion Gallery, you'll need to click on the "duplicate" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This will prompt you to choose a Notion workspace to duplicate the template to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If it is published, select "Start with this template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Duplicate the template to your desired Notion workspace to use it with PDFOutput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### 4. Adding the Template to PDFOutput Settings
After duplicating the template to your Notion workspace, return to PDFOutput and click on "settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, then "click here to add templates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

You will be asked to choose the Notion workspace where you duplicated the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Select the correct workspace from the dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> and click "Select pages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Choose the "Payment Receipts PDF Generator" file and click "allow access" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. PDFOutput will then read your template and database elements after successful authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### 5. Customizing the Template
The entire template is customizable to your specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. You can adjust formatting, add bold text, or change spacing as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The key is to ensure that any placeholder elements you want to replace from your database remain inside curly braces to ensure proper syncing and PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### 6. Mapping Notion Properties to Template Elements
Back in PDFOutput, refresh the screen to ensure all elements are fetched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
From the dropdown menus, select your "payment receipts database" and the corresponding "payment receipt template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Give your project a name (e.g., "payment receipt") and click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

PDFOutput will automatically load and map the Notion properties (database columns) on the left with the template elements on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If any elements are mismatched, you can manually select the correct mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The mapping view also includes filter, search, and sorting options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### 7. Exporting and Downloading PDFs
Once everything is correctly set up, click "export" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. PDFOutput will automatically add a "PDF status" column to your Notion database to indicate which rows have been generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. All rows will be ticked once generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

After a successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, you can click "preview sample" to view a sample of the generated PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. To download all the generated files, click "download all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Each generated file will correspond to a row in your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Additional Features and Tips

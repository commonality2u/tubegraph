The Notion personal finance tracker allows users to effectively manage and monitor their debt and liabilities, providing a comprehensive overview of financial obligations and progress towards payoff goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Debt Section
The tracker includes a dedicated debt section that displays all upcoming and past debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Users can quickly see the next payment due date, previous payment dates, the total debt amount, and the portion already paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This provides a quick overview of loan amounts and their contribution to total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Setting Up Debt Accounts
To begin [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view and then to the "Liabilities" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
Users can add new debts by clicking the "New" button and entering the debt's name and any opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Classification and Payment Frequency
Each debt account should be classified under the "Debt" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Users can also set a payment frequency, such as monthly, annually, or quarterly, for each debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Existing debt details can be modified by clicking the edit icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Recording Debt Transactions
Transactions related to debt payments are entered in the "Transactions" section, specifically under the "Liability" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
When recording a debt payment:
*   Select the date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Choose the relevant debt account (e.g., "Home Loan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   Specify the payment mode (e.g., Bank or Cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   Set the transaction type as "Outflow" since money is leaving the account to pay the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   Enter the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Conversely, if obtaining a new loan, the transaction type should be "Inflow" as money is coming into the loan account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Progress
[[tracking_debt_payments_and_analysis | Debt payment tracking and analysis]] is primarily done in the "Debt" section under the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This view presents two main categories:
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Debts with due dates in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Debts where the last payment was made, but the next expected payment (based on frequency) has been missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. For example, if a credit card payment is monthly and the last payment was July 14th, and the current date is August 30th, it will appear under past payments, indicating a missed August payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

The debt summary provides:
*   The total loan amount for each debt (opening balance + additional loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   The total repayment amount, displayed as both a sum and a percentage of the total debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
This allows for effective [[tracking_progress_of_debt_payoff | tracking progress of debt payoff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Customizing the Debt View
The appearance of the debt view can be customized:
*   Change the layout (e.g., listicle, gallery, board) via the "Layout" option in the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   Enable or disable desired properties (e.g., total amount paid, repayment percentage) in the "Properties" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   Group the view by "Payment Status" and sort manually to prioritize upcoming payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Debt within Overall Personal Finances
Debt falls under the "Liabilities" category within the tracker's "Accounts" section, alongside "Assets," "Income," and "Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This allows for [[overview_and_management_of_debt_categories | overview and management of debt categories]] as part of a broader financial picture. The net worth calculation, representing assets less liabilities, directly reflects the impact of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## Use for Couples
Couples can adapt the tracker to their needs by splitting different account categories, including liabilities, to denote individual contributions or responsibilities for debts (e.g., "Home Loan by [Partner A]," "Car Loan by [Partner B]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This allows for combined yet individually trackable personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

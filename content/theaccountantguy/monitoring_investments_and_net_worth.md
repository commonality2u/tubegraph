This article explains how to [[how_to_track_net_worth_using_notion | track personal finances]] using a Notion-based system, focusing on [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | monitoring investments]] and [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth progress]]. This system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial position, from daily transactions to long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Personal Finance Tracker Overview

The personal finance tracker is divided into three main sections:
*   **Net Worth Target** - Allows you to set a [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth target]] for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Accounts Section** - Where you categorize different accounts under income, expenses, [[financial_management_of_assets | assets]], and liabilities, along with opening balances and payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** - Provides an at-a-glance view of your finances, including income, expenses, debts, budgets, savings, bills, subscriptions, and [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** - Where all income, expenses, [[financial_management_of_assets | asset]], and liability transactions are recorded, impacting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

The system enables you to specify a [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth target]] at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This target can be easily adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

The [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth section]] in the summary view provides a total overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>
*   **Total Net Worth** - This is calculated as the difference between total [[financial_management_of_assets | assets]] and total liabilities after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Difference** - Shows how much you are "lagging behind" your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved** - Represents the total net worth divided by the net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Total Growth** - Calculates the closing net worth minus the opening net worth. Opening net worth is derived from the initial opening balances of [[financial_management_of_assets | assets]] and liabilities in the accounts section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## Monitoring Investments

### Setting up Investment Accounts

To set up an investment account:
1.  Navigate to the **Accounts** tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
2.  Add a new investment account, such as "Apple investment" or "Bitcoin investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
3.  Specify the **opening balance** (e.g., 0 at the start of the financial year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.
4.  **Classify** the investment (e.g., "stocks" or "crypto"). You can create custom classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
5.  Enter **opening units** if you held any units at the start of the financial year. If there are opening units, there must be an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.
6.  Crucially, select "Investments" under the **Asset Class** field. This ensures proper calculation of the total investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

### Recording Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded under the **Assets** section of the **Transactions** tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Purchases**: Always record purchases of investments at their **cost price** in the "Amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales**: When selling an investment, record the **cost value of the units being sold**, not the sale price, in the "Amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This method helps the system accurately calculate the profit or loss from the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

The system allows you to edit units and price for each transaction to reflect market activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Once populated, these figures contribute to the [[investment_dashboard_features | investment dashboard's]] profit/loss display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

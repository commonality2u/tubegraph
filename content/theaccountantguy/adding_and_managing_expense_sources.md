This article explains how to [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | set up and manage expense sources]] within a travel expense tracker, allowing users to keep track of their travel expenses and plan effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The tracker provides sections for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories and Sources

The initial step in managing expenses involves [[setting_up_expense_categories | setting up the different expense categories]] under the "Accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Pre-defined Categories
Expenses are classified under categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. All recorded expenses are booked under one of these pre-defined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources
To quickly add a new expense source, click the "add expense source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This action automatically adds a new source to the "Travel" category by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Modifying Expense Source Details
Once an expense source is added, you can click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This allows you to change the name of the source (e.g., to "Metro") and set a budgeted amount for it, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Each expense source should have a budgeted amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Moving Expense Sources Between Categories
If you wish to move an expense source to a different category, click on the three dots next to the source and place it under the desired section (e.g., "Meals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Details can be edited at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Creating New Expense Categories
To add a completely new category (group) separate from the existing "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" categories, click the plus sign on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Deleting Expense Sources
Expense sources can be quickly deleted if no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Monitoring Expense Performance

After [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | setting up these expense accounts]], the tracker provides a clear overview of financial performance.

### Individual Expense Source Performance
The "Expenses" section displays the total expense incurred, the budgeted expense set for that source, and the percentage of the budgeted amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Over Budget:** If incurred expenses exceed the budgeted amount (e.g., $2,000 spent on a $1,000 flight budget), the percentage will exceed 100% (e.g., 200%) and be indicated in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Within Budget:** If incurred expenses are within the budgeted amount (e.g., $100 spent on a $300 breakfast budget), the percentage will be below 100% (e.g., 33%) and indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

This [[tracking_expenses | expense tracking]] classification provides a quick glance view of where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Overall Summary
The "Summary" section provides a complete overview, showing the total budgeted expense, the total expense incurred, the difference between the two, and the overall percentage of total expenses relative to the total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For example, 59% indicates that 59% of the total budgeted expense has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Booking Individual Expenses

The tracker simplifies the process of [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | classifying and managing individual expenses]].

### Adding a New Expense Transaction
Expenses are classified under the same categories as the expense sources: "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Quick addition buttons (e.g., "add travel expense") allow for fast entry of new expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Clicking these buttons automatically adds a new expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Transaction Details
When adding a new expense, you can input the following details:

*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   **Trip Info:** A description of the trip (e.g., "trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Account of the Expense:** Select the specific expense source incurred (e.g., "Train" for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The monetary value of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it reflects in the "Expenses" summary for the relevant source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted expense was set for that source, the tracker will automatically reflect its performance against the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The Home Inventory Tracker is a straightforward template designed to help users keep a comprehensive record of their home inventory in one central location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key feature of this template is its ability to track both estimated and actual purchases, offering a clear financial overview of inventory management.

## Purchase Overview

On the left side of the template, users can quickly see a summary of their purchase data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   **Total Estimated Purchases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
*   **Total Purchases Made** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   **Difference** between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Total Percentage of Purchases** made in comparison to the estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

## Detailed Inventory Sections

The right side of the template is organized into three main sections that provide detailed inventory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>:

### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up various categories for their inventory, such as "Dairies and eggs," "Medicines," and "Fruits and Veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Under each primary category, subcategories are listed, along with the "estimated budgeted purchase" for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Inventory Overview
The Inventory Overview provides key metrics for each subcategory of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, including:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

### Transaction Section
This is where users can [[tracking_payment_transactions_and_updates | specify inventory transactions]] as they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, a "cheese purchase" can be entered by selecting the subcategory item and specifying the amount purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When items are consumed, users can add another entry and specify the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Automatic Updates and Benefits
All transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This ensures users can constantly monitor available inventory and track consumption levels for every item in their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This systematic approach allows for effective [[calculating_budgeted_versus_actual_expenses | tracking of budgeted versus actual expenses]] related to home inventory.

This Notion business expense tracker is designed to help keep track of all business expenses under one general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It simplifies the process of [[expense_categorization_and_tracking_in_notion | expense categorization and tracking]], providing a comprehensive overview of financial outlays.

## Expense Categories

The template includes a dedicated "Expense Categories" section where users can define the various expenses their business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Some predefined business expense heads are provided to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Customizing Categories
Users have full control over [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | customizing categories]]:
*   **Modifying Existing Categories**: To change an existing category, click on it, make the necessary modifications, and then click "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories**: Subcategories can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to them and then modifying the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: To add a new expense category, simply click the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Setting Budgets for Categories
Once categories are established, users can [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | set a budgeted amount]] for each expense type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This budgeted amount will automatically be reflected in the tracker's overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "Expenses Overview" section provides a summary of business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It displays:
*   The total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   The budgeted expenses that were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   A percentage indicating whether spending has exceeded the budget or remains within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Changes to budgeted amounts, such as adjusting an advertising budget from $100 to $5,000, will automatically update the figures in the expenses overview to reflect the new conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

In the "Transaction" section, users can begin entering their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
1.  **Date**: Choose the date of the expense; it will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  **Description**: Add a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

4.  **Amount**: Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary View

On the left side of the tracker, a summary provides a quick glance at key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This summary includes:
*   Budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

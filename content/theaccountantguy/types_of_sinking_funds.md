A sinking funds tracker is designed to help manage savings towards specific goals over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This includes tracking the overall savings needed, the amount saved to date, the remaining amount to save, and the percentage of contribution made over a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Defined Sinking Fund Categories

Six specific categories of sinking funds have been established to help [[organizing_funds_into_categories_for_financial_management | organize funds into categories for financial management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

*   **Education** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Events** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Family** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Healthcare** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Transportation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   **Utilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

These categories are consistently used across different databases within the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Key Information Tracked for Each Fund Type

For each sinking fund category, the tracker aims to record several key details to monitor progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:

*   **Goal Amount:** The total savings target for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Amount Saved:** The cumulative amount saved to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Amount Left to Save:** The remaining balance needed to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Contribution Made (Percentage):** The progress towards the goal, expressed as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Targeted Date:** The desired completion date for the fund's goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Required Monthly Contribution:** The regular payment needed each month to meet the target by the goal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Tracker Structure

To manage these various sinking fund types, a tracker built in Notion utilizes five distinct databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

1.  **Sinking Funds Database:** Holds all specific details for each sinking fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
2.  **Sinking Funds Details:** Stores information related to individual contributions for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
3.  **Sinking Funds Overview:** Provides a comprehensive view of all created sinking funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  **Sinking Fund Summary:** Offers a summarized form of the entire tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
5.  **Total Sinking Funds:** Calculates the combined total values across all sinking funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Each of these databases works together to provide a holistic view of the financial progress towards the various sinking fund goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

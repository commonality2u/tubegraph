*   **Adding New Credit Cards**

    *   Alternatively, new credit cards can be added by clicking a "new" button in the credit cards overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

    *   Users can assign or change a specific category for a credit card, or add a new category to existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   The status of each credit card can also be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Customizing Expense Categories

The tracker offers robust options for [[customizing_expense_categories | expense categories]] and their management.

*   **Adding New Categories**
    *   New [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | expense categories]] can be added directly from the expense details section by entering the category details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Categories can also be added or edited from the category section, allowing users to define their own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Setting Budget Amounts

Users can set specific budget amounts for each [[customizing_expense_categories | expense category]]:

## Setting Repayment Dates

The notification section helps users track upcoming repayment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Users can customize the next repayment date for each credit card by clicking on the date field and selecting a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   The tracker then calculates and displays the number of days remaining until the next repayment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

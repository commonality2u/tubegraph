## Transaction Entry

The template includes sections for entering transactions, which are crucial for tracking cash flow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
There are four primary views for transactions:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>

Additionally, there are views for:
*   Investments: Where units purchased, price, and investment value can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This allows tracking profit or loss on sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Inventory: Where units and price for inventory purchased and sold can be tracked, automatically calculating profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

This article outlines how to set up and use a personal finance tracker developed in Notion to manage various aspects of your financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The tracker is divided into several key sections, offering a comprehensive view of your finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Overview of the Notion Tracker

The Notion personal finance tracker features three main sections:
*   **Net Worth Target**: Allows you to specify your net worth goal for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section**: Where you define different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of your entire finances, including income, expenses, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section**: Where all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions are recorded, impacting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Here, you'll find pre-defined income (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expense accounts (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Adding/Modifying Accounts**:

    *   When creating a new account, you can type its name, specify an opening balance (typically ignored for income/expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, and classify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Classifications**: Expenses can be classified into categories like "Bills," "Savings," "Subscription," or "Debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency**: You can set how frequently you expect to pay an expense (e.g., monthly for utility bills, annually for subscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Transaction Views**: There are five views: "All" (shows all transaction types), "Income," "Expenses," "Assets," and "Liabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

    4.  Add a description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   Add a new expense (e.g., "Wi-Fi bills"), classify it as "Bills," and set its payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

### Tracking Bills in Summary
The "Bills" section under "Summary" shows upcoming and past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments**: Bills where the next payment is due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Past Payments**: Bills where a payment was due in the past and has not yet been recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. This helps identify missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

### Setting Up Subscriptions
*   Similar to bills, go to the "Account" section under "Get Started" and classify an expense (e.g., "Netflix," "Amazon") as "Subscription" with its payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

The "Subscription" view under "Summary" is similar to "Debt" and "Bills," showing upcoming and past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
*   It displays the next payment due date based on the last recorded payment and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   You can also see the subscription status (e.g., Active) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal

You can easily click and change this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### Viewing Net Worth Summary
Under the "Summary" section, click on "Net Worth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

*   It also shows the "Difference" (how much you're lagging behind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a> and the percentage of your goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   The "Total Growth" section indicates the growth from your opening net worth (based on opening balances of assets and liabilities) to your current closing net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

This article details how to record opening balances and units for investments using the [[setting_up_an_investment_portfolio_tracker_in_notion | Investment Portfolio tracker]] in Notion, a tool designed for [[financial_management_of_assets | financial management of assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Initial Setup of Investments

The [[setting_up_an_investment_portfolio_tracker_in_notion | Investment Portfolio tracker]] features an "investment section" which is categorized into sections such as stocks and cryptos, with the option to add additional custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For every investment recorded in the tracker, two essential details must be entered:
*   The **opening balance** of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   The **opening units** of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

These values represent the holdings at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Adding and Editing Investment Details

Investments can be quickly added using a "quick action button" labeled "add investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Clicking this button creates a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. To input specific details:
1.  Click on the pencil icon associated with the new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
2.  A new panel will appear where investment details can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
3.  Enter the investment name, such as "X investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
4.  Input the opening balance (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
5.  Specify the opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Initially, newly added investments may be classified under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. To assign a category (e.g., stocks or crypto), click on the three-dot icon and move it to the desired classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. New categories can also be created by clicking the plus icon and typing in a new group name, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Existing investment items can be edited by clicking on them and typing in the desired changes, then clicking "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The Notion savings funds tracker can be adapted to display different currencies, allowing users to manage their savings in their preferred monetary unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This feature is part of Notion's inherent capabilities for [[customizing_dashboard_views_and_currency_settings_in_notion | customizing dashboard views and currency settings]] within its databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Changing Currency Settings

To adjust the currency displayed in the savings tracker:
1.  Click on any amount field that currently shows a dollar currency symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  Within the property settings, locate the "Number format" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
4.  This "Number format" menu displays all the different currencies that Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The [[notion_inventory_template_setup | home Inventory tracker]] is a simple template designed to keep track of all your home inventory in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Overview of the Template

The template is divided into several sections:

*   **Left Side Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
    *   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
    *   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
    *   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

*   **Right Side Sections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Inventory Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
    *   Inventory Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
    *   Transaction Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

## Setting Up Inventory Categories and Subcategories

The template allows users to [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | set up different category]] of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of [[inventory_classifications_and_management | classified inventory]] categories include:
*   Dairy and eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Fruits and veggies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Under each main category, [[managing_a_customer_database_with_subcategories | subcategories]] can be listed along with the estimated budgeted purchase for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Inventory Overview

The "Inventory Overview" section provides key metrics for all listed items, including:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   The percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

These metrics are applicable to all different [[managing_a_customer_database_with_subcategories | subcategory]] items listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" is where users can specify inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, if "cheese" is purchased, an entry can be made specifying the item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Clicking on an item reveals its different subcategory items, the inventory items purchased, and the amount of purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

When an item like cheese is consumed, a new entry can be added, and in the "items used" column, the number of items consumed can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. All these transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, allowing users to track available inventory and consumption requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

This article demonstrates how a [[managing_debt_payments_and_statuses | debt payment tracker]] can be utilized to manage and pay off debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The tracker features an overview section that categorizes debts based on different payment frequencies, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Debt Overview Details

The debt overview section includes several key details for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **EMI Amount** (Equated Monthly Installment), which is the amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Interest Rate** (which can be specified by the user) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment Date**, indicating the first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   **Debt-Free By Date**, a calculated date signifying when the debt will be fully repaid if payments continue as specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Number of EMIs**, showing the total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Customizing Repayment Schedules

The tracker allows for extensive customization of repayment schedules:
*   **Adding New Categories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>: Users can add new repayment periods or categories, such as "weekly" installments, by clicking an "add a group" button and typing the desired frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system automatically inserts the new repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Pre-added Schedules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>: Necessary payment schedules are often pre-added for user convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Hidden groups can reveal additional schedules like quarterly and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Moving Debts Between Schedules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>: Any existing debt can be moved to a different repayment schedule (e.g., from monthly to quarterly), and all associated calculations will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Managing Debt Details

*   **Adding New Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>: A new debt can be quickly added to a "no payment frequency" column and then moved to a specific frequency to update its details accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   [[updating_and_managing_debt_installment_details | **Editing Existing Loan Details**]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>: Users can click on a debt field and modify its details, which will automatically update across all relevant sections and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section allows users to view and manage [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | debt payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:
*   **Paid Installments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>: This section reflects all paid debts, organized by month, with a summation of EMIs paid for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Payment Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>: A column indicates if an amount has been paid; clicking it updates the status (e.g., moving from paid to unpaid and vice-versa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Payment Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>: Users can input the payment date, select the specific loan, and enter the EMI amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule Calculation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>: The tracker automatically calculates the next repayment date based on the set [[customizing_and_configuring_loan_repayment_alerts | payment frequency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a monthly student loan paid on September 30th will have its next payment scheduled for October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, while an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will show the next payment on September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Adding New Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>: Clicking "pay debt amount" automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule with the current date, allowing users to then fill in the specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

All details entered in the transaction section, including changes to payment amounts, automatically update the [[debt_payment_tracking_and_analysis | debt payoff progress]] overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

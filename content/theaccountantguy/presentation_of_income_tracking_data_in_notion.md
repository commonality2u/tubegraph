A minimalistic Notion income tracker is designed with a primary dashboard that displays key financial insights across four main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This dashboard leverages five distinct databases to organize and present financial information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Components of the Notion Income Tracker Dashboard

The primary dashboard for tracking income in Notion is structured into four main sections:

### 1. Total Earnings

This section displays the overall income earned over a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. It is a linked view of the "Total Earnings database" and is presented in a list view format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### 2. Sources of Income

This section breaks down total earnings by different income sources, such as salary, side hustle, and other categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It shows the total earnings for each individual source and its percentage contribution to the overall income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For presentation, this section utilizes a three-column layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Users can create this by typing `/` followed by "three columns" in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These columns are linked to the "Income Source" database and displayed in a gallery format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The gallery format highlights the actual income and percentage for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### 3. Frequency of Income

This section visualizes how often income is earned, such as monthly, annually, quarterly, half-yearly, or as a one-time payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It calculates the total earnings and the number of sources for each income frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The presentation for this section is derived from the "Frequency of Income database" and uses a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. It displays the total earnings and the number of income sources per frequency type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### 4. Overview Section

The overview section presents monthly income data, organized into four distinct quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It also shows the percentage of each month's earnings relative to the total annual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

This section is linked to the "Period database" and uses a gallery mode for its presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Information is segmented into four quarters, with individual months specified for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Filters are applied to each quarter's view to include only the respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The earnings for each month and their proportion to total earnings are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Data Representation and Formatting

Within the databases and on the dashboard, financial figures are presented clearly:
*   Amounts are displayed with a sum value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Percentages, such as [[components_of_an_income_tracker_in_notion | earnings in percentage]], are formatted as percentages and often visually represented with a green bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

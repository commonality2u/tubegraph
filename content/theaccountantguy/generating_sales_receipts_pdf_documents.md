This article explores how to track sales using a dedicated template and generate sales receipt PDF documents using a specific online tool.

## Sales Receipts Tracker Template

A sales receipts tracker template can be utilized to keep track of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template includes a [[setting_up_a_sales_receipts_database|sales receipts database]] with information helpful for sales tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Key information captured in the database includes:
*   Receipt number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Receipt date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Payment method (with several options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Business name and address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Customer details and address (a relational property linked to another client database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Description of items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   Unit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For example, two different items can be sold in different quantities and unit prices on one receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Calculations within the template include:
*   **Subtotal:** Sums the total amount of individual items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate:** Applied to the subtotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Total Amount:** Computed after applying the tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Notes Column:** For related notes or payment clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary

A summary section at the top shows key performance indicators:
*   **Total Sales:** Drawn from the sales value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units Sold:** Represents the quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. If more description or quantity columns are added, formulas for subtotal and total amount need to be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Average Sales Value:** Calculated as total sales divided by units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Client Summary

A client summary provides sales data per client:
*   Total sales for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Total quantity of sales made to each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Average sales price for every client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

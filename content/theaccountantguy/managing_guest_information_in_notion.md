This article details a simple Notion template designed to track hotel bookings and manage guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template features key performance indicator (KPI) information at the top, providing quick summaries of booking data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Below the KPIs, a simple table allows for detailed entry of guest and booking information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, two main KPIs are displayed:

### Bookings by Room Type
This section shows the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the total number of guests who have booked that particular room is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Free Pickup Requests
This KPI indicates how many guests require a free pickup service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It distinguishes between "yes" and "no" responses, showing the count of guests for each option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This summary automatically updates based on entries in the main database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Guest Information Database

The main table at the bottom of the template is where individual guest and booking details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The information added here automatically reflects in the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

The table includes the following columns:

*   **Guest Name**: To enter the name of the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Email ID**: For the guest's email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Contact Details**: To include contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Special Request**: A field for any specific requests from the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is a placeholder text and can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date**: The date of the guest's arrival, which can also include a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: The date of the guest's departure, also with an option to include time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Room Type**: A selection property where users choose the specific room type the guest is booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Existing room types can be selected, or new ones can be added directly, which then appear in the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Room type icons can also be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Count**: This column allows for adding the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. By default, this data is not displayed in the top KPIs but can be added with customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup**: A simple "yes" or "no" option to indicate if the guest requires a free pickup service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

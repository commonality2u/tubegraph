This article outlines how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | track income and expense details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The spreadsheet provides instructions in a "Start Here" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and consists of three main tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Structure

### Budget Tab

The Budget tab is where you input details related to your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. You specify the budgeted amounts for each month for both expenses and income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Accounts are categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, and amounts are added for each month, with a total reflected in the "goal amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The "goal amount" column is formula-driven, so when adding new line items, the formula needs to be dragged down to copy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. New rows can be added by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Transactions Tab

After setting up accounts and budget estimations in the Budget tab, you move to the Transactions tab to [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | add new transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For each transaction, you can input the date, details of the transaction, the category (linked to accounts previously added), and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A column in this tab automatically specifies whether an entry is an income or expense based on the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Similar to the Budget tab, this formula-driven property can be dragged down for new line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Dashboard Tab

The Dashboard section provides an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | analysis of income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It is controlled by filters for category, period, and type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Key features of the Dashboard include:
*   **Summary**: Displays total income, total expense, and the net balance for a selected period (e.g., an entire year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Income Overview**: Shows different sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview**: Presents a breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview**: Details income, expense, and net balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout**: Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, thereby assisting in [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | tracking expenses against a budget]] and [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | tracking budgeted vs actual expenses]].

Users can filter the dashboard to see total income for a specific period or break down income by individual sources like "salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This allows for detailed analysis of added income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

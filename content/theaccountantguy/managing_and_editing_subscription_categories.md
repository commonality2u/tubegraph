The subscription expenses tracker, demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," provides tools for [[creating_an_expense_categories_system | categorizing]] and managing your subscription expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The tracker includes a "subscription overview" section, which offers a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Within the categories view, subscriptions are [[dividing_subscriptions_into_active_and_canceled | divided into active and canceled subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Underneath each category, you can find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

You can change the billing period by clicking on it and selecting an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, changing the name of the billing period is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Managing Expense Categories (Groups)

The "expenses section" further organizes subscriptions into different "groups" or "classifications," such as "infotainment," "education," and "music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Groups
You can [[adding_and_editing_expense_categories | add a new group]] by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Alternatively, you can [[managing_and_editing_expense_sources_and_categories | edit existing groups]] by clicking on them and changing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Underneath each classification of subscriptions, you will see:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Adding and Classifying Subscriptions

A quick action button allows you to "add subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When clicked, it automatically adds a new subscription that initially appears under a "note subscription category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

To [[adding_or_deleting_categories_in_a_notion_expense_tracker | move a subscription to a specific classification]]:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the newly added subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
2.  Move it to any desired classification, such as "active mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

You can then click the pencil icon to edit the details of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Transaction Section and Status
The transaction section is where details are fed to book expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It shows views for "active subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and "canceled subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, with subscriptions bifurcated into different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

To change a subscription's status:
*   Clicking a checkbox indicates if a subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   To cancel a subscription, simply click its checkbox, which will automatically place it under "cancel status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This change is reflected in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

When adding a transaction for a subscription, you can select the "subscription account" which pulls from all subscriptions added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The billing period is also pulled from the previously set value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Customizing Currency
A quick tutorial within the tracker explains how to change the currency displayed in the dashboard, allowing users to select different currencies as per their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

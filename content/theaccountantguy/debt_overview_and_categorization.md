This article explains how to utilize a debt payment tracker to manage and categorize debts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debts for clear visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Initially, it may divide debt into annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key details specified for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount:** The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment Date:** The first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A calculated date indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs:** The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Categorizing Debts

The tracker allows for flexible categorization of debts based on payment frequency:

### Adding New Categories
Users can add new payment categories beyond the default ones (annual, monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For example, a "weekly" repayment schedule can be added by clicking the "add a group" button and typing "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
Pre-added payment schedules are also available for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, including quarterly and weekly options, which may initially be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Moving Debts Between Categories
Any debt can be moved to a different repayment schedule by dragging its line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. When a debt is moved (e.g., under "quarterly"), its repayment schedule and related calculations automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Managing Debt Details

### Adding New Debts
A new debt can be quickly added by clicking the "add details" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It initially appears under a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Once added, it can be moved to a specific payment frequency column, allowing users to input relevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Editing Existing Debt Details
Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field and typing in changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These updates automatically reflect across all relevant columns and descriptions throughout the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

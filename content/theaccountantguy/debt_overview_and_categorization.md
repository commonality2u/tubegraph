This article describes how a [[managing_debts_and_loans_using_notion | debt payment tracker]] can be utilized to manage and pay off debts, focusing on the debt overview and categorization features within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The [[components_of_a_notion_debt_tracker | debt overview section]] provides a categorized view of all debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Debt Categorization

Debts are typically divided into categories based on their payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Common categories include:
*   Annual payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Quarterly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

### Debt Details

For each debt, the following details are tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **Debt Details** (First Column) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount** (Equated Monthly Installment) - the amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment** - the first payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   **Debt Free By** - a calculated date by which the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Number of EMIs** - the total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

### Adding and Managing Categories

New payment categories can be added by clicking an "add a group" button and specifying the installment period, such as "weekly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Users can also find and select from existing repayment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules by dragging the line item to the desired category, which automatically updates the repayment schedule and related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debt Details

*   **Adding New Debts**: To add a new debt, users can click an "added details" button, which initially places the new entry into a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once a frequency is selected, the details can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debts**: Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field and typing in changes, which automatically updates the information across all columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

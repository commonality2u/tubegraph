The Notion expense tracker allows users to [[creating_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | organize and manage expenses]] by categorizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These categories are [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | customizable]] to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Category Overview
The expense tracker includes a category section at the top, typically starting with three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For each category, you can view both a budgeted expense amount and an actual expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As expenses are entered into the tracker, the corresponding category amounts are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

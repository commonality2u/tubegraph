## The Concept of Grand Strategy

Paine defines [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | grand strategy as "the integration of all relevant instruments of national power in the pursuit of national objectives"]]. She argues for its necessity, citing modern Western governments with cabinets representing these different instruments, crucial for coordinated foreign policy.

A key example of failed grand strategy is Japan leading up to and during World War II. Unlike the Meiji Restoration period where coordination existed, by World War II, Japan heavily prioritized its military (Army and Navy) while [[japanese_warfare_strategy_and_tactics_during_world_war_ii | neglecting and even assassinating civilian leaders who offered dissenting opinions]], such as the finance minister who warned of unaffordability. This lack of coordination led Japan into "deep, dark trouble." Countries that fail to coordinate all instruments of national power when pursuing objectives like security or trade often face severe consequences.

President Eisenhower's approach to decision-making exemplified effective grand strategy. He would convene all relevant parties, [[dictatorship_versus_democracy_in_military_decisionmaking | encourage them to present arguments and counter-arguments for various courses of action]], and then collaboratively arrive at a decision. Paine notes that such debate and disagreement are strengths of democracy, contrasting with dictatorships that tend to double down on bad decisions.

## World War I: A Failure of Grand Strategy

Paine characterizes World War I as a conflict marked by a profound failure of grand strategy, where civilian leadership largely [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | ceded decision-making to military generals]]. The focus was almost entirely on operational success, leading to horrific tactics like repeatedly sending waves of young men "over the trenches" with devastating casualty rates.

### Consequences of WWI
The mismanagement of World War I had enormous and far-reaching consequences:
*   **Power Vacuum:** The war led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian Empires, fundamentally upending the European order.
*   **Rise of Pernicious Ideologies:** The instability and devastation created fertile ground for fascism and communism, putting these ideologies "on steroids." Paine argues that the Cold War's ideological underpinnings can be traced back to 1917, when the Bolsheviks declared war on the capitalist order [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | and international alliances]].
*   **Impact on the British Empire:** Britain, a maritime nation, built a continental-sized army for WWI. This strategic misstep, according to Paine, marked "the beginning of the end of the British Empire."
*   **Lessons for WWII Leadership:** Many strategic leaders of World War II had been conscripts in World War I. Having survived the horrors and witnessed the strategic failures, they thought deeply about what went wrong, [[impact_of_historical_decisions_on_modern_warfare | leading to an emphasis on institution-building and better integration of national power in the subsequent conflict]].
*   **Russian Collapse:** Imperial Russia's fall in WWI was partly due to a failure by its allies to adequately supply its massive army with weapons, a lesson that influenced the Lend-Lease Act in WWII.
*   **Perceived Vindication of Marxism:** The seemingly callous disregard for human life by capitalist nations in WWI appeared to [[economic_and_political_structures_in_historical_contexts | vindicate Karl Marx's critiques of capitalism and imperialism]].

## World War II

World War II saw different approaches to strategy and coordination, heavily influenced by the [[impact_of_historical_decisions_on_modern_warfare | lessons from WWI]].

### Allied Strengths and Coordination
The Western Allies, particularly the U.S. and Britain, demonstrated better strategic coordination in WWII, partly due to:
*   **Learning from WWI:** The horrific experience of WWI prompted significant institution-building, such as the National Security Act in the U.S., leading to organizations like the National Security Council, the United Nations, and NATO.
*   **Democracy:** Democratic systems in the U.S. and [[comparisons_of_different_regimes_and_the_global_impact_of_maos_policies | Britain allowed for better coordination and consideration of counter-arguments]].
*   **Civilian-Military Integration:** Military success was not solely due to generals like Patton but relied on a vast civilian architecture, including code-breaking efforts (Enigma machine with British and Polish help), industrial mobilization (Henry Ford converting car factories for tanks, Liberty ships), and scientific advancements (the Manhattan Project) [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb | the making and impact of the atomic bomb]].
*   **Lend-Lease to the USSR:** Recognizing the mistakes of WWI, the Allies provided crucial supplies to the Soviet Union, including rolling stock for railways, high-octane jet fuel, and vast amounts of food (famously, Spam). Paine emphasizes that Russia could not have [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | fought effectively without this aid]].
*   **Strategic Alliance with the USSR:** Cooperating with Stalin was a pragmatic decision to defeat the primary threat, Hitler. Positive rhetoric about Stalin during this period was alliance management, not necessarily communist sympathy on the part of Western leaders like FDR.

### Axis Powers: Failures and Miscalculations

#### Germany (Hitler)
*   **Initial Success and Hubris:** Hitler's Blitzkrieg was initially incredibly successful [[hitlers_strategic_mistakes_in_world_war_ii | but this success bred hubris]], leading to overextension by invading Poland, then Russia, and declaring war on the United States.
*   **Genocidal Program and "Death Ground":** Hitler's genocidal policies, particularly against populations like the Poles, ensured perpetual instability in occupied territories, as these groups would never give up their identity. This brutality placed his enemies on "death ground"â€”a situation [[impact_of_cultural_values_on_war_conduct | where they have no choice but to fight for survival]].
*   **Inability to Stop:** Despite opportunities to consolidate gains (e.g., after the fall of France), Hitler's ambitions, as outlined in *Mein Kampf*, were not aligned with such limited objectives.
*   **Leadership on "Death Ground":** The German leadership continued the war long after it was obviously lost, partly because they themselves felt they were on personal or career "death ground" and had fed their population propaganda about annihilation if they lost [[psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes | psychological manipulation]].

#### Japan
*   **Lack of Grand Strategy:** Japan prioritized its military over civilian expertise, ignoring financial warnings and assassinating dissenting voices, leading to [[japanese_warfare_strategy_and_tactics_during_world_war_ii | disastrous decisions]].
*   **Overextension and Brutality in China:** Japan had been at war in China since 1931, committing atrocities [[cultural_influences_on_japanese_military_decisions | that ultimately galvanized Chinese resistance and became a major impetus for Chinese nation-building]].
*   **Pearl Harbor as a Pivotal Error:** Already overextended in China, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a "pivotal error" that created powerful new allies (the U.S.) for China.

*   **High Morale and Cultural Factors:** The famed high morale and reluctance of Japanese soldiers to surrender were rooted in [[cultural_influences_on_japanese_military_decisions | cultural factors: strong identification with in-groups, a sense of obligation, and the profound dishonor associated with failure for oneself, family, and locality]].
*   **Internal Atrocities and Exhaustion:** The Japanese military committed atrocities against its own soldiers, such as executing the wounded to prevent them from becoming cripples or falling into Allied hands. By 1945, Japan was economically shattered, with its industrial production a fraction of the U.S.'s, and facing severe food shortages. This exhaustion led to a societal shattering.
*   **Emperor Hirohito's Late Intervention:** Emperor Hirohito only intervened to break the cabinet deadlock and push for surrender at the very end, fearing assassination or being declared deranged if he acted sooner. He lacked substantial military or strategic expertise.
*   **Impact of U.S. Tariffs:** The [[role_of_the_us_oil_embargo_and_diplomatic_miscommunications_prewwii | Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930]], enacted by the U.S. without considering international repercussions, devastated trade-dependent Japan. This pulled the rug out from under Japanese moderates advocating cooperation and pushed the country towards an imperialistic path to secure resources, culminating in the 1931 invasion of Manchuria.
*   **Leadership on "Death Ground":** Figures like Tojo Hideki felt they were on career "death ground," [[psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes | with no way to back down without facing execution]].

### The Soviet Union in WWII
*   **"Death Ground" and Resistance:** Hitler's invasion put the Soviet Union on "death ground," [[psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes | which was key to their fierce resistance despite initial welcomes by some, like Ukrainians disillusioned with Stalin]].
*   **Industrial Production and Lend-Lease:** While the USSR produced advanced tanks, its war effort was heavily reliant on Allied Lend-Lease for critical components like transportation (rolling stock), high-octane fuel, and food.
*   **Post-War Expansion:** Stalin successfully expanded Soviet influence far beyond Tsarist ambitions, retaining a contiguous empire and dominating Eastern Europe.

### Key Strategic Concepts in WWII
*   **Unconditional Surrender:** The Allies pursued unconditional surrender against Germany and Japan (as well as the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War). However, [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | unlike the Axis powers, the Allies did not generally put the civilian populations of these nations on "death ground"]].
*   **Civilian Casualties and Starvation:** Starvation was a major cause of civilian deaths. Paine suggests the atomic bombs, by ending the war quickly, may have saved millions who [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb | would have otherwise starved]]. Firebombings like that of Tokyo were horrific, but Japanese society was already near collapse due to the prolonged war and resource deprivation.

### Axis Lack of Coordination
A significant factor in the Axis defeat was their poor coordination, stemming [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | from differing primary enemies]]:
*   Germany's primary enemy was Russia.
*   Italy's primary enemy was Britain (to secure its Mediterranean ambitions).
*   Japan's primary enemy was China.
This contrasted with the Allies (U.S., Britain, USSR), who were largely aligned against Germany as their primary enemy. Examples of Axis discoordination include Japan and Germany having non-aggression pacts with Russia at different, uncoordinated times, and Germany not being warned about the Pearl Harbor attack but being [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | dragged into war with America as a result]].

### Post-War Occupations and the Dawn of the Cold War
*   **Germany and Japan:** The post-war occupations were successful largely because they involved [[comparisons_of_different_regimes_and_the_global_impact_of_maos_policies | rebuilding existing, functional institutions]] (police, education, government, businesses) in nations that already possessed a strong sense of national identity. A competent post-war generation, horrified by the war, was keen to rebuild. MacArthur's imposition of a new constitution in Japan, including universal suffrage, permanently changed the balance of power there.
*   **Origins of the Cold War:** Paine argues the Cold War effectively began in 1917 with the Bolsheviks' declaration against the capitalist order [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | and international alliances]]. The WWII alliance against Hitler was a temporary convergence of interests. Once this primary enemy was defeated, the underlying ideological conflict between communism and capitalism predictably resurfaced, leading to the Cold War.

Paine's analysis underscores that the outcomes of both World Wars were deeply shaped by the presence or absence of [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | effective grand strategy, the quality of leadership, and the ability of nations to learn from past mistakes and build resilient institutions]].

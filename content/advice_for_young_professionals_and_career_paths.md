Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, shared his evolving thoughts on career advice for individuals in their 20s, building upon his previous advice for those aged 10 to 20 [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. His primary focus shifted towards encouraging the pursuit of deep expertise and considering paths beyond the typical Silicon Valley archetype.

## Reconsidering San Francisco for 20-Somethings

While Collison previously advised teenagers to go to San Francisco [[the_impact_and_philosophy_of_san_francisco_on_innovation_and_entrepreneurship | the impact and philosophy of San Francisco on innovation and entrepreneurship]], he now wonders if people in their 20s should reconsider this, or at least not see it as a universal default.

### The San Francisco Archetype and its Limitations
Collison notes that San Francisco (used as a metonym for a certain cultural orientation) valorizes:
*   Striking out on one's own.
*   Iconoclastically dismissing received wisdom.
*   The "founding archetypes" of figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

While acknowledging the value of this phenomenon, he believes this cultural orientation doesn't sufficiently encourage the pursuit of really deep technical knowledge [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | the role of cultural and technological innovations in human evolution]].

### The Value of Deep Expertise
Collison emphasizes that many valuable and fulfilling career paths require accumulating significant expertise and studying a domain in tremendous depth over extended periods [[exploring_the_future_of_society_and_economy_with_ai | exploring the future of society and economy with AI]]. He provides examples:

*   **Herb Boyer**: Co-founder of Genentech, who helped produce cheap insulin using recombinant DNA. Boyer couldn't have achieved this in his early 20s; it required a multi-decade career to accumulate the necessary knowledge and skills. Collison feels San Francisco's culture doesn't adequately encourage becoming like Herb Boyer.
*   **Patrick Hsu**: Co-founder of Arc, who announced a new phenomenon called "bridge editing" (a new recombinase for DNA insertion). Accomplishing such work requires long study and acquisition of technical skills [[advancements_in_genomics_and_ai | advancements in genomics and AI]].

## Diverse Career Trajectories

### No Single Prescribed Path
Collison refrains from normatively prescribing a life direction, acknowledging successful examples of varied strategies [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | the evolution and future of the tech industry]]. He highlights that even his own path is just one among many possibilities.

### The Importance of Different Contributions
He stresses that many important inventions and positive developments in the world require trajectories very different from his own entrepreneurial path [[role_of_tech_entrepreneurs_in_modern_warfare | role of tech entrepreneurs in modern warfare]].

## Cultivating Skills and Finding Direction

### Seeking Maximal Learning
For those pursuing paths requiring deep expertise, Collison advises individuals to find the "gradient of maximal learning" in whatever they care most about [[philosophical_perspectives_on_consciousness_and_free_will | philosophical perspectives on consciousness and free will]]. This doesn't necessarily mean following the most establishment or credential-oriented path.

### The Role of Mentorship and Environment
*   **Biology as an Example**: In fields like biology, acquiring "bench skills" and specific factual knowledge is crucial. Pure autodidacts are rare; direct experience in a top lab is usually necessary to see how things are done in practice.
*   **Lessons from "Apprentice to Genius"**: This book highlights key learnings from mentorship, such as:
    *   **Problem Selection**: Choosing what to work on is a critical and subtle skill in science, involving balancing importance, hardness, and achievability [[impact_of_intelligence_and_skills_on_economic_progress | impact of intelligence and skills on economic progress]].
    *   **High Standards**: Mentors help mentees understand what truly high standards are.
*   **Experiencing High Standards First-Hand**: Collison notes that people often report a permanent shift in their own standards after working with exceptional individuals or organizations. He advises young people to identify domains of interest and then seek out environments where the highest standards are embodied to experience them directly [[cultivating_skills_and_finding_direction | cultivating skills and finding direction]].

### Alternative Career Structures (e.g., Arc Institute)
Collison points to organizations like Arc Institute, which aim to provide career paths for scientists who love research but may not want to become Principal Investigators (PIs). This allows talented individuals to continue contributing to science without fitting into the traditional academic PI track [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | challenges and opportunities in deploying AI at scale]]. The bridge editing technology, for example, was led by a senior scientist at Arc who had finished his postdoc but may not have wanted to become a PI.

## Navigating Cultural Tides

### San Francisco's Status Orientation
Collison observes that San Francisco is very status-oriented, with entrepreneurs often held in "excessively high regard". While he values entrepreneurs, he cautions against entrepreneurship becoming people's sole fixation [[entrepreneurial_challenges_and_venture_capital_dynamics | entrepreneurial challenges and venture capital dynamics]].

### Wariness of Prevailing Moods
He underscores the difficulty but importance of being wary of following prevailing tides, moods, and whims [[challenges_in_ai_governance | challenges in AI governance]]. However, he also cautions against "reflexive contrarianism for the sake of it," as simply inverting the prevailing mood still means being dictated by it [[economic_growth_and_ai | economic growth and AI]].

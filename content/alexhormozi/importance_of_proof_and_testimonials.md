Proof and testimonials are critical for building [[building_trust_and_credibility_in_customer_relationships | trust]] and convincing potential customers, especially when starting a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that having strong proof is more impactful than an amazing offer with no evidence to back it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Why Proof and Testimonials Matter
*   **Credibility:** Proof answers the fundamental question, "Why should I believe you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Believability:** Customers need to see proof that is similar enough to their own situation to believe that your solution will work for them too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Foundation for Growth:** Proof and testimonials are essential before scaling advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Obtaining Proof and Testimonials
The speaker's journey to accumulate proof involved several stages:

### 1. Starting with "Homies" (Friends)
Initially, the speaker offered free fitness training to friends to get "before and after" pictures and testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This step was crucial for gathering initial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Variety of Results:** The testimonials from this phase included a guy who lost 50 lbs, a girl who lost 50 lbs, and a guy who achieved a "recomposition" (same weight, but significant body changes), covering different "avatars" or customer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This variety inadvertently helped later to demonstrate effectiveness for different goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### 2. The Free Training Project
After working with friends, the speaker launched "The Free Training Project," where clients donated $500-$1,000 to a charity of their choice in exchange for three months of free training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This model allowed him to continue gathering results and testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

### 3. Transition to Paid Service ("Skinny to Swole" Project)
With a strong collection of transformation pictures and testimonials from the free phases, the speaker launched a paid program, "Skinny to Swole," charging $200 a month for 12 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. The existing proof allowed for a smooth transition of free clients to paid ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a> and attracted new paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned About Proof
*   **"Walk the Walk":** You should be the most significant "walking billboard" for what you sell. It's difficult to sell weight loss if you're overweight or investing advice if you're poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
*   **Proof Over Promise:** While a promise is good, prioritize providing proof, as it builds [[the_importance_of_belief_and_trust_in_sales | belief]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Monetary Compensation:** In the beginning, accept non-monetary compensation like testimonials, [[the_importance_of_providing_value | feedback]], and [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] as these can be more valuable long-term than immediate cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. A banger testimonial can generate more money than what a client might have paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.
*   **Visual Proof:** Incorporating images or carousels of transformations directly into posts can increase engagement and clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Inherent Proof:** Referencing a long-term project (e.g., "for the better part of a year I've been taking part in a free personal training project") can serve as inherent proof of dedication and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Consistent input leads to consistent output. Doing more, faster, and more consistently results in more consistent outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>. This applies to generating proof as well.

The speaker's first advertising post formally announced being "open for business" and directed people to a website to see transformation pictures, which were the key "proof" for the offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>.

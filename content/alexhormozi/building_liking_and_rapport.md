The principle of liking, often referred to as rapport, is a powerful persuasion tool. People are more likely to be persuaded by individuals they like and wish to emulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Essentially, the more you like someone, the more inclined you are to agree to their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Core Principles

*   **Mutual Affection** People tend to like those who like them, or those they perceive as friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Power of Compliments** Even when individuals knew they were receiving paid compliments from strangers, they still developed a greater liking for those who complimented them compared to those who didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This suggests that the effect of flattery works even if the recipient is aware of its intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Genuine Flattery** There's seemingly no limit to the amount of flattery someone will accept, provided it is perceived as genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Application in Business and Sales

### The ACA Framework

A practical method for building liking and rapport, especially in sales or associative situations, is the ACA framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:

*   **Acknowledge** What the other person says. This demonstrates active listening and attention, which people highly value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Compliment** What they did in relation to what they said, connecting it to a positive attribute of theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Ask** The next question to guide the conversation forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Personal Anecdotes on Building Rapport

The speaker shares personal tactics used in their own business to build rapport and increase sales:

*   **Mini Trampoline** When conducting 20+ in-person consultations daily, a mini trampoline was kept next to the desk. Bouncing on it during meetings, despite appearing "like a psychopath" to some, made people close more deals. It's difficult to be in a bad mood on a trampoline, and this lightheartedness positively influenced clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Cartwheel Greeting** Prior to using the trampoline, a cartwheel was performed every time before shaking a client's hand upon their entry into the gym. This unexpected, humorous action immediately made clients laugh and like the speaker, leading them to [[sales_tactics_to_build_trust | buy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

These tactics demonstrate that when clients [[building_trust_in_sales_through_integrity | liked]] the speaker, they were more inclined to transact, often buying the "feeling" conveyed during the conversation rather than just the service itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

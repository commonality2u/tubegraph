To succeed, especially in your 20s, it's crucial to be intentional about your social circle and influences, as they significantly impact your growth and future [03:09:00].

## The Impact of Your Social Circle

Your friend group and the people you compare yourself to have a "disproportionate sway" over your behavior [03:09:00]. In fact, your [[impact_of_social_circle_on_financial_success | reference group]] is one of the top correlations with how successful your life becomes and the goals you achieve [03:11:00].

### Prioritizing Your Goals Over Relationships

It's a tough truth, but sometimes you must prioritize your goals over your current friendships [03:37:00]. If a person in your life makes it less likely you'll achieve your goals, it's better to remove them [03:07:00]. While this may sound "unbalanced," those who achieve great things often realize that "balance is a myth" at certain stages of their lives, opting instead for intense focus [00:50:13].

Many friendships are based on convenienceâ€”like living in the same dorm or neighborhood, or attending the same class [03:56:00]. As your conditions change, many of these relationships will naturally fade away [03:05:00]. The speaker, for example, only talks to one friend from middle/high school and two from college, and even then, only every six months or so [03:33:00].

### Identifying True Friends

Ask yourself a simple question about your friends: Is it "more likely or less likely that I hit my goals with this person in my life?" [03:03:00] If your friends don't support your goals, they are not truly your friends; some might even be your "enemies" [04:04:00].

## Navigating the "Lonely Chapter"

When you embark on a path of personal development and goal achievement, you often enter a "lonely chapter" [03:48:00]. This is a period where you no longer fit in with your old friends, but you haven't yet achieved enough to integrate with a new group [03:48:00].

*   **Embrace the isolation:** This period, devoid of distractions, can be highly productive, allowing you to focus disproportionately on your work and learning [03:50:00].
*   **Resist conformity:** Don't "bend the knee" to the hate or disapproval from your old circle just to fit back in [03:17:00]. This path is comfortable and warm, but "you know exactly where it ends," and it's likely not where you want to be [03:32:00].
*   **The price of being exceptional:** If you aim to be exceptional, you will, by definition, be the exception [03:48:00]. You will be "unlike the others," which naturally places you in the "outgroup" [03:54:00]. While this desire to be in the "ingroup" is deeply ingrained in our DNA and can cause feelings of shame, it's a necessary step in your transition between social circles [03:59:00].

## Impressions and Humility

How you present yourself and interact with others, especially those more experienced, plays a key role in your growth.

*   **Impressing the right people:** If you want to impress rich people, outwork them [03:58:00]. Attempting to impress poor people by outspending them, or showing off early in your career, will be seen as irresponsible by wealthy individuals [03:55:00].
*   **Humility is power:** For younger individuals, those ahead of you are often willing to share valuable advice if you humble yourself [02:29:00]. By admitting you don't know everything and are eager to learn, you can receive insights worth "thousands of dollars, years of your life for free" [02:05:00]. Don't let ego prevent you from learning from those with more experience, even if you think you're smarter [02:40:00]. [[importance_of_respect_and_supporting_each_others_ambitions | Humility]] allows others to exalt you through your work, rather than you exalting yourself and appearing insecure [03:08:00].

The constant appraisal of your skills and activities, asking whether they make it "more or less likely" you hit your goals, will bring clarity [03:52:00].

Reframing is a powerful [[sales_training_and_frameworks | sales skill]] that separates top performers from the rest, designed to increase the likelihood of a prospect buying when they say anything other than "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It typically involves one to three sentences said after a prospect's statement that shifts the conversation's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Instead of directly answering a prospect's question, reframing encourages asking questions *about* their question. This approach keeps the salesperson in control of the conversation, similar to a lawyer in an interrogation who only asks questions they already know the answer to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## The 3A Framework

The 3A Framework for reframing is taught as follows:

1.  **Acknowledge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
    *   Restate what the prospect said back to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   This builds rapport by showing active listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   It also buys the salesperson time to think about their next response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Prospect: "How many certifications do your trainers have?" Salesperson: "So you're curious about what our certifications are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

2.  **Associate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
    *   Connect the prospect's question or statement with the behavior of someone who gets the best results from the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   This [[amplifying_positive_statements_in_sales_pitches | amplifies positive statements]] and validates the prospect's thinking, turning a potential step away from buying into a step towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Salesperson: "It's a great question, it actually shows that you're a really rational person and you're making a serious decision here, which is amazing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>

3.  **Ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    *   Pose a new question that "attacks the frame" of their initial question or concern, allowing the salesperson to control the direction of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Salesperson: "Which certifications are you looking for specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

## Five Rules for Ethical Use of Reframing

### Rule 1: Prospects Believe What They Say, Not What You Say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
The goal is to ask questions that lead prospects to conclude they are a good fit, rather than telling them they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Asking "Do you have any questions?" is considered the worst question in sales as it invites objections and gives the prospect control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Answering questions directly puts the salesperson on the defensive, as the prospect becomes the "judge, jury, and executioner" of the answer's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

A common [[strategies_for_handling_sales_objections | overcome]] for a prospect demanding direct answers is to use analogies, such as:
*   The "secretary and surgeon" analogy: "It would be like you asking the secretary about how your heart surgery is going to be with the surgeon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   The "mechanic" analogy: "You're asking me what's wrong with your car and it would be [[ethical_guidelines_for_reframing_in_sales | unethical]] for me to answer it without looking under the hood first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
This allows the salesperson to maintain the [[ethical_guidelines_for_reframing_in_sales | ethical]] high ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Rule 2: No One Can Disagree with a Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
Salespeople should avoid disagreeing with prospects, as arguments lead to losing the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The objective is to change their mind agreeably, which is achieved by asking questions that keep them engaged and talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This approach makes the salesperson "like smoke" â€“ impossible to catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Rule 3: Tell Them What Their Question Means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>
This rule emphasizes the "Associate" step of the 3A framework, where the salesperson tells the prospect what their question reveals about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. By connecting the prospect's concern to a positive attribute or a common trait of successful customers, the salesperson can reframe an obstacle as a positive indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Rule 4: Use Straw Men for Tough Truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>
When a prospect holds a flawed belief or makes a "ridiculous" statement, a "straw man" technique can be used to deliver a "harsh truth" without insulting the prospect directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This is crucial for maintaining rapport. Three strategies for using Straw Men:

1.  **Reference a "similar person" who asked the same question:** "It's so funny you ask that because I had someone just earlier today who asked the same questions. Can I share with you what I just shared with them?" This allows the salesperson to be brutal about the "other person" without offending the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
2.  **Reference a successful past customer:** "That actually makes you just like Sarah who had a similar Plumbing business and actually crushed it with our marketing agency." This connects the prospect's behavior to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
3.  **Appeal to Authority:** If there's a respected expert (like a CEO) in the business, appeal to their authority rather than your own. "It's so funny that you ask that, Alex just told me this thing earlier today. Can I share it with you?" This positions the salesperson as a messenger, delivering information without personal judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

These subtle shifts allow for direct conversations without damaging rapport, making the prospect feel heard, intelligent, and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Rule 5: Retain Childlike Curiosity at All Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>
The core of this rule is to "seek to understand, not win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Salespeople should genuinely believe in their product's benefit for qualified prospects. This perspective shifts the focus from "being right" to helping the prospect make the "right decision" for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

A mental exercise for this is imagining you've traveled back in time to convince your past self to buy a valuable stock (e.g., Nvidia, Apple, Bitcoin). Even though you know the future, you would approach your past self with empathy and a desire to understand their concerns, knowing the decision is in their best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## Practical Reframing Examples

Reframing can be applied to common [[strategies_for_handling_sales_objections | sales objections]]:

*   **"I need to think about it."**
    *   Acknowledge: "Totally understand." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
    *   Ask: "What are the main things you're considering?" / "What's your main concern?" / "What are you most afraid of having happen?" / "What would make this a no?" / "What would it take for you to say yes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

*   **"I don't have time."**
    *   Acknowledge: "Totally understand, timing is kind of tough for you right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
    *   Associate: "I think it's smart that you're already thinking about implementation. Our biggest success stories are actually people who think about the process the same way you are right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
    *   Ask: "So what would make it a good time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

*   **"I need to talk to my spouse."**
    *   Acknowledge: "Totally understand. I think it's really sensible that you'd want to talk to your spouse and super fair." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>
    *   Ask: "Just so I understand, out of curiosity, what parts do you think they wouldn't like? What parts do you think they would disagree with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

*   **"I hate this particular feature."**
    *   Acknowledge: "Totally get it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
    *   Ask: "Why not?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Universal Response: "What are you most afraid of?"

When a sale is further along, a powerful question to cut to the core issue is "What are you most afraid of having happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. For initial objections, softer questions like "What's your main concern?" or "What are the variables you're using to make the decision?" are more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

### Influencing with Labels

The association step is crucial as it allows the salesperson to [[reframing_personal_labels_to_influence_behavior_and_decisions | give the prospect a label]] that they will then strive to live up to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. For example, if a prospect is labeled "smart" or "rational" early on, that label can be invoked later in the close to connect smart people with making the purchasing decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

This framework is utilized in advanced [[sales_training_and_frameworks | sales training]] and [[sales_closing_frameworks | closing frameworks]] by businesses looking for [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals | improving sales techniques for closing deals]] and [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

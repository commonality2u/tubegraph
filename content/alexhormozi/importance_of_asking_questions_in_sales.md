Asking questions is a powerful sales skill that differentiates top performers from the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The person asking the questions is the one in control of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. When a prospect starts asking questions, the salesperson is put on the defensive, which is not the desired position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The goal is to always maintain control by asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Reframing: A Core Sales Skill

Reframing is the skill of using one to three sentences after a prospect says anything but "yes" to increase the likelihood that the next thing you say will lead them to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It's about asking a question about their question rather than directly answering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This technique has been successfully used for sales ranging from $100 to over a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

**Example of Reframing a Question**
If a prospect asks, "How many certifications do your trainers have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, this can be a trap question because any numerical answer allows the prospect to be the judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Instead, a reframe might be, "Well, which certifications are you looking for specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Similarly, if a prospect asks about the number of email support questions, and any given number might be deemed "not enough" or "too many," leading to a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. A reframe could be, "Why do you want to ask additional questions? How many questions do you want to ask? Is there a purpose that you're trying to solve with this? What are you most afraid of?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These questions reframe the conversation without directly answering the initial query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Reframing is crucial because it allows the salesperson to ask for the sale multiple times without decreasing rapport with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## The 3A Framework for Reframing

This framework helps in handling objections and advancing the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### 1. Acknowledge
This step builds rapport by restating what the prospect said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. It makes the prospect feel heard and actively listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, and also buys the salesperson time to think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

**Example:**
Prospect: "What kind of certifications do your trainers have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
Salesperson: "So you're curious about what our certifications are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

### 2. Associate
This is a key part of the framework where the salesperson associates the prospect's question with the type of behavior someone who gets the best results from the product or service would ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. It reframes a potential objection into a positive sign of qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

**Example:**
Salesperson: "It's a great question, it actually shows that you're a really rational person and you're making a serious decision here, which is amazing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

### 3. Ask
After acknowledging and associating, the salesperson asks their next question to guide the conversation forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This question should attack the frame of the prospect's initial question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

**Example:**
Salesperson: "Which certification are you looking for specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
If the prospect names a specific certification, and you don't have it, you can follow up with: "Why those certifications specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> This allows you to explain your alternative certifications without directly failing or losing the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Rules for Using Questions Ethically and Effectively

### Rule 1: Always Be the One Asking Questions
The prospect believes almost nothing you say, but almost everything *they* say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The goal is to ask questions so they conclude they are a good fit, rather than you telling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Avoid asking "Do you have any questions?" as it invites objections and relinquishes control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. When answering questions, prospects become the judge of your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

You can redirect direct questions by using analogies:
*   **Secretary/Surgeon Analogy:** "It would be like you asking the secretary about how your heart surgery is going to be with the surgeon; you're going to want to talk to the surgeon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   **Mechanic Analogy:** "You're asking me what's wrong with your car and it would be unethical for me to answer it without looking under the hood first." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Emphasize that anyone giving an answer without an assessment is just trying to sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This provides the ethical high ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Rule 2: Never Disagree with a Question
No one can disagree with a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The mindset should be "be like smoke" â€“ always shifting by asking more questions to avoid being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. You never [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals | win a sale]] by winning an argument, as both parties lose rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The objective is to get them to change their minds in an agreeable way, which is done by asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

If a prospect says, "I need to think about it," examples of questions include:
*   "What are the main things you're considering?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>
*   "What are the variables that you're considering in your decision?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
*   "What's your main concern?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   "What are you most afraid of having happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
*   "What would make this a no?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>
*   "What would it take for you to say yes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>

When addressing "I don't have time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>:
*   Acknowledge: "Totally understand, timing is kind of tough for you right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   Associate: "I think it's smart that you're already thinking about implementation. Our biggest success stories are actually people who think about the process the same way you are right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Ask: "So what would make it a good time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

When addressing "I need to talk to my spouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>:
*   Acknowledge: "Totally understand, I think it's really sensible that you'd want to talk to your spouse and super fair." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>
*   Ask: "Just so I understand, out of curiosity, what parts do you think they wouldn't like? What parts do you think they would disagree with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>

By continually asking questions about their questions, you stay in the sale and can continue to ask for the close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Rule 3: Tell Them What Their Question Means (Associate)
This rule elaborates on the "associate" step of the 3A framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Salespeople should never be caught off guard by questions or statements, as they have had many more conversations than the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Prospects often throw up "smoke screens" to get out of the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

The premise for effective sales is to "state the facts and tell the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. If a prospect is qualified and the product will help them, there is an ethical obligation to guide them towards a good decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. [[handling_objections_and_maintaining_control_in_sales_conversations | Resistance]] is a normal part of the sales process; the best salespeople are comfortable with conflict and can deescalate situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Sales is a dance, not a fight; seduction, not force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Prospects like you when you ask questions about them and compliment them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>: "That's a really smart question," or "That makes you just like the people who have the best success stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This approach validates the prospect, making them feel listened to, intelligent, and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

### Rule 4: Use Straw Men for Tough Truths
When a prospect has flawed beliefs or makes ridiculous statements, a salesperson might need to deliver a "harsh truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Straw men (or "foils") are caricatures of someone just like the prospect, allowing the salesperson to have a tough conversation without directly insulting the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Three ways to use straw men in the "associate" step:
1.  **Reference a Past Conversation:** "It's so funny you ask that because I had someone just earlier today who asked the same questions. Can I share with you what I just shared with them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> This allows you to be "brutal" to the other person, not the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
2.  **Reference a Successful Past Customer:** "Totally understand, you know what, that actually makes you just like Sarah, who had a similar Plumbing business and actually crushed it with our marketing agency." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a> This associates the prospect with success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
3.  **Appeal to Authority:** If the CEO or an expert is well-regarded, you can say: "It's so funny that you ask that, Alex just told me this thing earlier today. Can I share it with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a> You become the messenger, not the one delivering the difficult message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

This [[strategies_for_handling_sales_objections | triple reframing]] technique allows salespeople to deliver hard truths and [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals | close the deal]] without making the prospect feel attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### Rule 5: Retain Childlike Curiosity at All Times
A helpful physical technique is to occasionally say "huh" with a curious tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This buys time and signals a desire to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The goal is to seek to understand, not to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

A core belief for a salesperson should be: "Keep the human number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. If you genuinely believe your product will help a qualified prospect, you must understand their concerns to help them overcome them, because you know it's the right decision for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

Think of it like going back in time to convince your past self to buy a stock you know will skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. You would have empathy, understand their concerns, and guide them with questions like:
*   "What are your main concerns?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
*   "What are you most afraid of?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>
*   "What would it take for you to say yes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>

Sales are not closed by being right, but by making the prospect right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The aim is for the prospect to feel good about the logical decision they are making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. The salesperson should act as a guide, providing context and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

By associating positive labels with a prospect's questions or initial statements (e.g., "you seem like a really honest person," "that's a really smart decision," "you must be a good family man") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, the salesperson gives the prospect a label to live up to. This allows them to tie those initial positive traits to why the prospect should buy later in the close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

A universal response for many situations, especially when further along in the sale, is: "What are you afraid of having happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a> If it's a first objection, "What's your main concern?" or "What are the variables you're using to make the decision?" helps triage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. If a prospect says, "I just need more time," a follow-up is, "Totally understand, what would make it a no?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>

Asking questions keeps the salesperson in control and facilitates the prospect's journey to a good decision, provided rapport has been established and maintained throughout the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

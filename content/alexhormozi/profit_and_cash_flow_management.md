The core concept behind significant business growth, even with limited initial capital, is an equation called **Client Financed Acquisition (CFA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This approach allowed for the growth of a business from an initial investment of $1036 to over $120 million in sales, with a current portfolio company doing $85 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The key is to grow portfolio companies with 100% equity, avoiding outside capital or investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Instead of the common belief that a business takes two or three years to break even, this strategy aims to make money consistently from the outset, reducing stress and increasing enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Client Financed Acquisition (CFA) Explained

In plain terms, Client Financed Acquisition means getting your customers to pay for all of your marketing and acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This allows a business to leverage "the universe's money" rather than its own, enabling significant cash flow for operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The principle is that you can generate more money from a customer entering your world than it costs to acquire and fulfill their initial service or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If this can be achieved within the first 30 days, while still covering the cost of fulfillment and having money left over, you achieve what is termed a "negative acquisition cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means you make money simply by acquiring customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Profit is crucial in a capitalist society for weathering economic storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### The CFA Equation

The equation is as follows:
`30-day cash > 2 * (Cost of Acquiring Customer + Cost of Fulfilling Customer)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

Let's break down the components:

1.  **30-day Cash**: This refers to the net free cash flow collected by the business within the first 30 days of a customer engaging with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This initial cash flow is crucial, as future upsells, continuity payments, or lifetime value are not considered for this specific calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The 30-day timeframe is significant because it aligns with interest-free financing periods typically offered by credit cards, allowing a business to "take unlimited money" by paying off expenses within this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This was literally how a second business was started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

2.  **Cost of Acquiring Customer**: This includes all expenses related to bringing in a new customer, such as marketing teams, sales commissions, advertising, and lead acquisition methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

3.  **Cost of Fulfilling Customer**: This represents the cost associated with delivering the product or service to the acquired customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

#### Example Calculation:

If:
*   Cost of Acquiring Customer = $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Cost of Fulfilling Customer = $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>

Then:
*   Total Cost (Acquisition + Fulfillment) = $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Required 30-day Cash (2 * Total Cost) = $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>

If you make $400 in 30-day cash and the costs are $200, you have $200 left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This remaining $200 is precisely enough to acquire and fulfill another customer, creating a self-financing loop for new customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This allows for unlimited power to acquire new customers and generates unlimited money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Impact and Application

By adopting this approach to customer acquisition, companies can grow without being constrained by capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While other constraints like operations or hiring may exist, the ability to acquire new customers and make sales will not be a limiting factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This process involves designing systems in every business where the money made in the first 30 days significantly exceeds two times the cost of acquisition and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

This model has been successfully applied to various businesses:
*   A brick-and-mortar chain grew from zero to six locations in three years, with each location opening at full capacity on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   A licensing business went from zero to $2.5 million a month (or $28 million top line per year) within 12 to 14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A second business reached $1.7 million a month in four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   A software business reached $1.7 million in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Ideally, the 30-day cash should be significantly more than twice the costs (e.g., 10 times), which allows for even greater cash flow and investment in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This strategy allows a business to multiply and grow using customer money to finance all growth, rather than personal capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It addresses the limiting belief that "it takes money to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The most powerful sales tactic involves gaining trust from the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This method, discovered by accident, allowed the speaker to sell to 100% of people and enabled new salespeople to close 80-90% of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The "Sacrificial Lamb" or "Ghost Product" Strategy

This tactic, originally called "sacrificial lambs" and now "ghost products," involves proactively recommending that a customer purchase certain items elsewhere, even from competitors, to build immense trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Origin Story
While selling supplements in a retail gym environment, the speaker ran out of a key product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Instead of trying to skirt around not having the item, he directly told a customer they could get it cheaper at Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. After this concession, the customer bought everything else he recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This led to further experimentation, where he started advising customers to buy other products elsewhere, saving them $10-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He even told one customer not to buy a "mass gainer" supplement they didn't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Over time, he realized that he didn't even need to carry the products he was recommending customers purchase elsewhere, as their value was primarily as a trust-building sales tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### How it Works
The core principle is to act in the customer's self-interest rather than your own, which makes them feel you're not trying to take advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

*   **Build Trust Faster**: By making a concession with a "ghost product" or "sacrificial lamb," you accelerate the [[building_trust_and_credibility_in_customer_relationships | trust-building process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Product Choice**: When using this tactic, recommend that customers purchase the lowest-margin products from competitors, while keeping your high-margin products for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This strategy makes customers trust you, leading them to buy the higher-margin items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Intent**: [[building_trust_in_sales_through_integrity | Trust in sales]] is built when your intent is to help, which is positive manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. If you believe in what you sell, you can create an environment where someone will trust you faster by giving them a reason to trust you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Application Examples
*   **Supplements/Physical Products**: Directing customers to a competitor for a cheaper alternative of a low-margin product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Services (e.g., Web Design)**: If a service is not your core capability or would be more expensive for you to provide, recommend a specialist or cheaper alternative (e.g., a freelancer in the Philippines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This positions the salesperson "on their side of the table," fostering immense trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Prescriptive Selling & Closing

Beyond building trust, the sales process should guide the customer towards making the best decision for themselves.

*   **Vision and Benefits**: Give someone a vision of what their life will be like when they experience the benefits of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Pre-Sell Usage**: Explain exactly how to use the product before making the ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Habit Integration**: Help customers integrate product usage into their existing habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. For example, suggest placing supplements next to a toothbrush so they don't forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Getting someone to make a new habit is difficult; piggybacking on existing ones makes you a better salesperson and coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **One-Click Upsell / Prescriptive Close**: After explaining the benefits and usage, simplify the purchase decision by having payment information on file, making it a "one-click upsell" where they only need to say "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This is a combination of a [[sales_closing_frameworks | prescriptive close]] and using ghost products to establish trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Handling Objections and Budget Concerns
*   **Prioritize Importance**: If a customer is on a budget, offer to order products by importance, showing what they absolutely need versus what provides faster benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Reintroduce the Problem**: If a customer removes a product, don't show it as unimportant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Instead, reintroduce the problem the product solves (e.g., "you'll have to eat a lot of broccoli to replace this") to highlight its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Find Hidden Money**: Help customers find money for the purchase by identifying expenses from old habits they will stop doing (e.g., less going out, less drinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Psychological Positioning
The ultimate goal for a salesperson is to move from "across the table" to "shoulder to shoulder" with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This means both parties are looking at the decision together, with the same information, to make the best choice for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Sacrificial lambs and prescriptive selling are fast ways to achieve this psychological shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Practice and Repetition
To [[enhancing_sales_skills_through_low_ticket_transactions | enhance sales skills]], gain extensive practice by engaging in many low-ticket transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Working with businesses that have high volume, low-ticket sales (e.g., car washes, massage, nails) allows for constant repetition, which teaches more about selling and dealing with people than any course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This experience makes selling higher-ticket items feel like a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

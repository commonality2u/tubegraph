The concept of the American Dream often implies that individuals are encouraged to strive for [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | success]] and prosperity through hard work. However, the reality of this dream can be complicated by societal reactions once that success is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Underdog vs. The Achiever

There appears to be a shift in how people view someone's progress from being an "underdog" to becoming "the man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This transition can be challenging, as the support and encouragement an individual receives during their struggle may turn into resentment or criticism once they begin to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Examples of Shifting Perceptions

*   **The Personal Trainer**: One business guru shared his experience as a personal trainer who slept in the gym while building his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His trainees initially expressed support and hope for his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, once he owned the gym and began making significant progress, their attitude shifted to skepticism and questioning of his work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Sam's [[overnight_success | Overnight Success]]**: Similarly, a public figure named Sam experienced a rapid rise to prominence, almost [[overnight_success | overnight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While people in his circle may have initially wished him well on his journey to become a professional bodybuilder or YouTube personality, their reactions changed once he started achieving those goals and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### The Core Realization

This phenomenon was so impactful that it led to an essay titled "Everyone believes in the American dream until it comes true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The central idea identified was:

> [00:00:58] Everyone wants you to do well as long as it's not better than you.

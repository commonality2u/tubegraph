Building a strong network and fostering meaningful relationships are crucial for entrepreneurial and personal growth. The speaker emphasizes that success often comes from connections and the value exchanged within these relationships.

## Strategic Proximity: Being Around "The Who"

Living in an environment where "shit's happening" and people are actively pursuing their goals is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Investing $200-$400 a month to move to such an area can be well worth it to escape stagnant environments, unsupportive friends, or discouraging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

The speaker's early career moves were solely focused on being around successful people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Finding Communities
To connect with like-minded individuals, engage with online communities, Discord groups, and Facebook groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Look for "pockets of people" who share similar ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### The Influence of Your Environment
Being around people who are thriving will raise your standard of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, showing you what's truly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Use this as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. When surrounded by successful individuals, conversations shift to different time and money increments, such as discussions about six-figure investments or plans spanning decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that one can often gauge people's potential wealth by how they discuss and allocate resources like time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Building Relationships Through "Handshakes"

The speaker attributes much of their accelerated progress to "handshakes instead of hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Almost all significant deals in their life originated from connections within one or two degrees of separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### Accepting Invitations
> "Don't turn down the first invite." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>

If you connect with someone and they suggest getting dinner, make it happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Making that initial meeting work significantly increases the likelihood of a lasting friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Turning down the first invite can signal disinterest and lead to a breakdown in potential connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

### Providing Value
Before meeting someone, conduct about 30 minutes of research on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The goal is to bring something valuable to the table, whether it's applying your skill or providing in-depth guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

#### The "Free Pass" Fallacy
Offering services for free often leads to poor execution and resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Instead, if you want to genuinely do someone a favor, "blow them away" with the quality and speed of your work, making them feel awkward due to the sheer value provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

This approach means investing in long-term relationships that will pay dividends later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. While there's a risk of not getting anything back, this act of giving is what it looks like to "make the world a better place" at a micro level for an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

### The Power of Not Needing Anything Back
The ultimate leverage in a relationship is not needing anything in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. By consistently providing value when you don't need anything, you "stack IOUs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. When you are ready to make a move or need support, you'll have numerous "blank checks" ready to cash in, propelling yourself much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

> "The time to dig the well is not when you're thirsty, but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>

This proactive approach of building goodwill and relationships early allows you to go on the offensive when the time is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

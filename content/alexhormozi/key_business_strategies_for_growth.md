Many common [[business_growth_strategies_and_challenges | growth strategies]] are ineffective because they lead people to work on things that do not significantly move their business forward [00:00:02]. Growth is often counter-intuitive [00:00:28]. To achieve significant growth, it's crucial to identify and prioritize the single most impactful problem, rather than getting caught up in numerous smaller tasks [00:01:27].

## The Business as a Tree Analogy
Imagine your business as a tree, where its height over time represents your revenue [00:00:30].
*   **Offshoots (B+ Problems):** These are minor issues or improvements, such as adding to an email sequence or working on a fall plan [00:00:49]. While they seem like "solving problems," they divert resources (time, effort, capital) from the main trunk, causing growth to stagnate [00:01:00]. You might feel busy, but your revenue remains flat [00:01:07].
*   **Pruning for Growth:** Just as pruning keeps a tree healthy, cutting off these distracting offshoots directs all resources directly into the main trunk [00:01:17]. This focused effort allows the business to grow vertically and remain concentrated on the one thing that will move the tree (revenue) up the most [00:01:27].

## The A+ Problem vs. B+ Problems
Entrepreneurs often have a long list of things they believe they should do [00:02:05]. However, they tend to tackle numbers five, three, or two on the list first because these are quick and easy to "knock out," providing a fast dopamine hit [00:02:08]. This leaves the number one problem, the most important one, untouched at the end of the day [00:02:17].

*   **B+ Problems:** These are easier to solve because you know how to approach them, making you feel productive [00:02:32].
*   **A+ Problems:** These are typically more complex, have more variables, require analysis, and need iterative solutions [00:02:40]. Because they are harder and often soaked in the unknown, people prefer to delay them [00:02:49]. However, solving the A+ problem can make all other problems on the list irrelevant by comparison [00:02:26].

## The Theory of Constraints
This entire approach is based on the [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | Theory of Constraints]] [00:07:23]. This theory posits that in any system, there is only one constraint limiting growth [00:07:26]. Once that constraint is identified and addressed, the business can experience significant breakthroughs [00:07:31]. The goal of strategy is to prioritize limited resources against unlimited opportunities [00:08:07]. There are millions of ways to grow a business, but usually, there's one thing that will accelerate growth more than anything else [00:08:18].

### The Big Wheel Analogy
Many people try to make a small wheel spin faster, working hard on minor tasks [00:09:20]. The key is to find the "big wheel" â€“ that one major initiative where a single revolution generates more progress than ten revolutions of a small wheel [00:09:36].

## Implementing a Focus Strategy
To effectively implement this strategy and achieve [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | business growth and scaling]], especially with a team, consider these tactical steps:

1.  **Prioritize:** Identify the one most important thing that will move the needle the most [00:11:02].
2.  **Increase Urgency and Cadence:**
    *   Change meeting frequency for the priority task from weekly to daily or even twice a day [00:11:20]. This communicates its immense importance [00:11:24].
    *   Set clear deadlines [00:11:41].
    *   Increase communication frequency; check in after an hour to show urgency [00:12:13].
3.  **Eliminate Alternatives (Commitment):**
    *   Commitment is the elimination of alternatives [00:01:49].
    *   Communicate to your team that everything else they are working on is less important and they need to "let some fires burn" [00:12:00]. This means accepting minor issues elsewhere to fix the major constraint [00:03:31].
    *   Assure your team that they will not be blamed for letting smaller issues persist [00:03:41].
4.  **Make Winning Obvious & Provide Incentives:**
    *   Create a dashboard or progress marker to visibly show progress [00:12:46]. This acts as a reinforcement loop for the team [00:12:54].
    *   Implement a "pot of gold" reward for achieving the priority, such as a team dinner or a day off [00:13:02]. This shows "what's in it for them" and helps maintain commitment [00:13:18].
5.  **Reassess and Re-prioritize:** Once the primary constraint is solved, reassess the situation and identify the *next* single most important thing to focus on [00:15:29]. The solutions to the previous A+ problem may have rendered other items on the list irrelevant [00:06:01].

## Case Studies and Practical Application

### Paid Ads Team Example
A portfolio company's paid ads team was struggling with pixel tracking issues for three weeks, distracted by various funnels and follow-up sequences [00:04:50].
*   **The Constraint:** Incorrect pixel tracking meant none of the conversion rate optimization efforts would matter [00:05:04].
*   **Action Taken:** All other issues were ignored [00:05:31]. An immediate end-of-day meeting was scheduled [00:15:59]. Team members were explicitly told to drop other meetings and daily tasks [00:16:02]. Every line item for pixel fixing was assigned with minute/hour timelines [00:16:24].
*   **Outcome:** The pixel issue was fixed, and the team was ready to tackle the next priority, knowing their focused effort yielded results [00:17:25].

### Sales Event Show-Up Rate Example
Another portfolio company had a low show-up rate for their sales events, complaining about lead quality [00:18:18].
*   **The Constraint:** Improving the show-up rate to industry standard would increase revenue by 35% and more than triple profit (given a 10% margin), with no risk [00:18:36]. No other initiative offered such a return [00:18:54].
*   **Action Taken:** Everyone in the company was given the sole priority of increasing the show-up rate [00:19:08].
*   **Outcome:** The business grew by over 35% due to this unified focus [00:19:21]. Other less important issues (customer service, sales department glitches) were allowed to "burn" but did not derail the primary goal [00:19:28].

### Avoiding Half-Built Bridges
Many businesses lose money by starting numerous projects but never completing them [00:18:09]. They build "half-built bridges" across the river, spending resources without ever getting their "dollars across to the bank account" [00:17:40]. Focus ensures completion and realization of returns.

## Overcoming Challenges: Fear of the Unknown & Team Alignment

### Tackling the Unknown
A+ problems are often "big hairy problems" because they are "soaked in the unknown" [00:20:26]. You might not know where to start or how it will end, but you know its fundamental importance [00:20:51].
*   **"Pulling the Thread":** Start by taking the first step to understand the problem [00:21:20]. Each subsequent step becomes clearer as you unravel the issue [00:21:28].

### Information Transparency
Entrepreneurs often fear sharing too much financial or operational information with their team [00:22:10]. However, major publicly traded companies operate with full transparency to all employees [00:22:20].
*   **Benefit:** Increased information transparency means everyone knows the financial state, conversion rates, and profit margins, enabling the entire team to help solve problems effectively and align with the priority [00:21:54]. This eliminates irrational fears about transparency [00:22:33].

### Managing Team Anxiety
When a new priority is set, teams can get overwhelmed if they still have old tasks [00:22:56].
*   **Practice:** Review team members' agendas [00:23:05]. Explicitly tell them which tasks to drop, table, or delay, reassuring them that old priorities are no longer relevant [00:23:13]. This provides clear direction and reduces anxiety [00:23:44].

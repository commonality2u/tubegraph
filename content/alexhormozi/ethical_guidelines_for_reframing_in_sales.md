Reframing is a crucial sales skill that involves saying one to three sentences after a prospect expresses anything other than a "yes" to increase the likelihood of them buying the next thing you say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This technique can be applied in various sales scenarios, from $100 items to million-dollar service packages, across in-person, phone, Zoom, or stage interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The goal of reframing is to maintain rapport and control of the conversation, allowing the salesperson to continue asking for the sale without alienating the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The most productive salespeople ask for the sale more times than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## The [[3a_framework_for_reframing_in_sales | 3A Framework for Reframing]]

The [[3a_framework_for_reframing_in_sales | 3A framework]] consists of three steps:

1.  **Acknowledge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>:
    *   Restate what the prospect said to build rapport and demonstrate active listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   This also provides time to think about the next response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Prospect asks about trainer certifications. Salesperson: "So you're curious about what our certifications are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

2.  **Associate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
    *   [[amplifying_positive_statements_in_sales_pitches | Associate]] the prospect's question or statement with the behavior of someone who gets the best results from the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   This makes the prospect feel they are taking a step towards buying, even if their statement initially seemed like an objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Salesperson: "It's a great question, it actually shows that you're a really rational person and you're making a serious decision here, which is amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

3.  **Ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>:
    *   After acknowledging and associating, ask a question about the prospect's original question to [[handling_objections_and_maintaining_control_in_sales_conversations | maintain control]] of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Salesperson: "Which certifications are you looking for specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This "attacks the frame" of the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Five Rules for Ethical Reframing

### Rule 1: Prospects Believe What They Say, Not What You Say
The goal in sales is not to tell prospects they are a good fit, but to ask questions so they conclude it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

*   **Avoid "Do you have any questions?"** This phrase invites objections and cedes control of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Maintain control:** As soon as you start answering questions, the prospect becomes the judge of your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Use analogies for clarity:**
    *   **Secretary/Surgeon:** "It would be like you asking the secretary about how your heart surgery is going to be with the surgeon; you're going to want to talk to the surgeon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   **Mechanic:** "You're asking me what's wrong with your car and it would be unethical for me to answer it without looking under the hood first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Ethical high ground:** It is unethical to give definitive answers without proper assessment. Emphasize that anyone who does so on a first call is merely trying to make a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Rule 2: No One Can Disagree with a Question
Think of sales as "being like smoke" â€“ constantly shifting the interaction by asking questions, making it impossible for the prospect to directly disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   **Avoid arguments:** You never win a sale by winning an argument, both parties lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Change minds agreeably:** Prospects do not change their minds when feeling insulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This is achieved by asking questions without appearing insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Ask more questions:** If unsure how to answer a question, ask more questions about their question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   *Examples:*
    *   Prospect: "I need to think about it." Salesperson: "Totally understand, what are the main things you're considering?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>
    *   "What's your main concern?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
    *   "What are you most afraid of having happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>
    *   "What would make this a no?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>
    *   "What would it take for you to say yes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>

### Rule 3: Tell Them What Their Question Means ([[amplifying_positive_statements_in_sales_pitches | Deep Dive on Association]])
This rule is about effectively [[reframing_personal_labels_to_influence_behavior_and_decisions | associating]] and [[amplifying_positive_statements_in_sales_pitches | amplifying positive statements]] to influence the prospect's perception of themselves and the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

*   **Anticipate objections:** Salespeople should never be caught off guard by prospect questions or statements, as they have had many similar conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Ethical foundation:** Good selling means selling to qualified prospects by stating the facts and telling the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. If the prospect is qualified, there is an ethical obligation to guide them towards a beneficial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Comfort with conflict:** The best salespeople are comfortable in situations others perceive as conflict, and they de-escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Sales as a "dance":** Sales is about seduction, not force; there must always be consent from the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Build rapport through validation:** People like those who ask about them, compliment them, and validate their questions (e.g., "that's a smart question," "that's reasonable," "rational decision," "fair point") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This makes prospects feel heard and intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Prefacing hard truths:** Prefacing difficult statements with validation allows you to deliver "hard truths" faster without causing offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Rule 4: Use Straw Men for Tough Truths
When a prospect's beliefs are flawed, or a "harsh truth" needs to be delivered, use a "straw man" technique to deliver it indirectly, preventing insult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

*   **Avoid superiority:** Don't put yourself above the prospect (e.g., "Can I put my coach hat on?"). This can be perceived negatively, especially by older, more successful prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Three Straw Man Strategies:**
    1.  **Refer to "someone else":** "It's so funny you ask that because I had someone just earlier today who asked the same questions. Can I share with you what I just shared with them?" This allows brutal honesty towards the third party, not the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
    2.  **Refer to a "successful past customer":** "That actually makes you just like Sarah who had a similar plumbing business and actually crushed it with our marketing agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This associates the prospect with success.
    3.  **Appeal to authority:** "It's so funny that you ask that, Alex just told me this thing earlier today. Can I share it with you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The salesperson acts as a messenger, sharing insights from an edified figure rather than their own opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

*   These techniques create a neutral third party, allowing for agreeable explanations and breaking unhelpful beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This allows for tough truths to be shared without breaking rapport, making people *like* being sold by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

### Rule 5: Retain Childlike Curiosity
Maintain a tone of genuine curiosity and desire to understand, rather than to win an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

*   **Verbal cues:** Use sounds like "Huh" and phrases like "That's so interesting you'd ask that question, can I ask you a little bit more about that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This buys time and signals an open mind.
*   **"Keep the human number one":** Genuinely believe that your product will help the qualified prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. If you know it's the right decision for them, seek to understand their concerns to help them overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
*   **Empathy (time travel analogy):** Imagine traveling back in time to convince your past self to buy something you know will be immensely valuable (e.g., Nvidia stock, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. You would approach with empathy and seek to understand their concerns, focusing on the prospect, not just the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Make the prospect "right":** Sales are closed by making the prospect feel right, not by winning an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The goal is to make money, not to be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Be a guide:** Position yourself as a helpful guide who shares information to assist them in making a good decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Labeling and reinforcement:** [[reframing_personal_labels_to_influence_behavior_and_decisions | Give prospects positive labels]] (e.g., "honest," "smart," "good family man") early in the conversation and bring them back up during the close to reinforce why they should buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This pairs their initial obstacles with reasons to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## Universal Response / Pro Tip
A powerful universal response, especially deeper in the sale, is "What are you most afraid of?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. For initial objections, questions like "What's your main concern?" or "What are the variables you're using to make the decision?" are useful for triaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. If a prospect needs more time, ask "What would make it a no?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. These questions keep the conversation going and move the prospect towards a decision, provided rapport has been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

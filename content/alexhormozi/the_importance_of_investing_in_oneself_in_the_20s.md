Successfully navigating your 20s requires avoiding common money mistakes, many of which involve not adequately investing in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prioritizing [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | personal and financial growth]] during this decade can lead to significant long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Prioritizing Education and Earning Capacity

### Avoid Overspending on Status
In your 20s, it's common to not have substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Spending excessively on luxury items like expensive cars or watches to "flex" for other twenty-year-olds is seen as unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Instead, successful individuals prefer to see younger people focusing on "eating poor, learning and hustling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The money that might be spent on status symbols should instead be invested into your own ability to earn more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This approach earns respect from those who are already successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Seek Jobs for Learning, Not Just Earning
A major mistake is taking jobs solely for immediate income rather than for the learning opportunities they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Your 20s should be a "season of learning, not a season of earning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While another job might offer a higher salary, those offering a premium may not provide additional value or learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The earning potential from an extra $10,000 or $25,000 per year in your 20s is inconsequential compared to the [[the_role_of_longterm_investment_in_personal_growth | long-term impact of developing skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Strategic Financial Management

### Invest Your Savings in Yourself
While saving money is important, in your 20s, it's crucial to invest it into your earning capacity rather than just traditional savings accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The amount you make at this stage is often relatively low, making traditional savings less impactful when considering inflation over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Doubling or tripling your earning capacity by [[investing_in_selfeducation_and_skills_development | investing in yourself]] will yield far greater returns than saving money for conventional assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Prioritize Investment First
Decide how much you will invest in yourself *before* spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This means allocating funds for your learning and education off the top, rather than seeing what's left at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This creates a dedicated "pile of gold" for opportunities to learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Automate Investing, Manualize Spending
Make it easy to [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | invest in yourself]] by automating transfers to your personal investing account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Conversely, make it harder to spend on non-essential items that don't provide a return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Using cash instead of credit cards, for instance, can make you feel the "pain" of spending, reducing impulse purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Shop with a Purpose
Avoid aimless "shopping" without a specific agenda, as it often leads to wasted money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Stick to pre-approved lists and budgets for necessary items like groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This simple habit can provide lifelong dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Takeout Food
Contrary to popular belief, once you earn more than $15 an hour, it can be more financially sensible to work during the time you would spend cooking and instead buy takeout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The time saved from meal prep, grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning can be reallocated to working and earning more, thereby [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | investing in your earning potential]] rather than saving pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Environment and Mindset

### Live with the Right People
Choosing the right roommates is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Avoid those who are irresponsible, break things, or are late on rent, as they create distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. More importantly, seek out roommates who share similar goals and aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. People with smaller goals may project their limiting beliefs or even subtly undermine your path, especially since the early stages of success can resemble failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Living with others who are also striving allows for mutual encouragement and shared perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This can also be a cost-effective way to live in better areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Prioritize Your Micro-Community
Your immediate environment, or "micro-community," significantly impacts your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It's often worth paying a premium for convenience: being close to transit, a gym, and affordable food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This saves time on commuting and other ancillary costs, allowing more time for productive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Model the Right Season of Life
Avoid trying to emulate the current lifestyle of highly successful individuals if you are in an earlier stage of your journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A reputation is built on what you've done and what you say you'll do, both coming true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Focus on modeling the actions they took when they were in your current "season" of life, such as [[importance_of_starting_personal_growth_and_learning_early | learning and building foundations]], rather than their current expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Measure Money by Time Earned
To understand the true cost of purchases, calculate how long you must work to earn the money for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, a $100 shirt might require 6 hours of work after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This perspective helps you evaluate if an item is truly worth the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Compete with Yourself on Savings for Investment
Shift your focus from how much you earn to how much you are saving to invest in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Make it a personal challenge to consistently put money into your personal investment account each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Many people who earn large incomes end up with nothing because they don't prioritize this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Check Your Account Daily
Regularly checking your bank account can help you stay aware of your financial reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While it might initially be uncomfortable to see low balances, confronting this reality is the first step to changing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Consistent monitoring helps you understand your spending patterns and improve your financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Investing in Experiences

### Smart Spending on Unique Experiences
While frugality is key, there are specific instances when spending money on experiences is worthwhile, especially in your 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These are often "one-time experiences" that may not be feasible or enjoyable later in life, such as backpacking through Europe and staying in hostels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Your 20s offer optimal windows for certain types of adventures that close as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. If you are proud to spend on a limited, unique experience, it is supported, as long as it doesn't drain your entire investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. These experiences contribute to the [[the_value_of_experiences_and_community_in_the_20s | value of experiences and community in the 20s]], even if they don't offer direct financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

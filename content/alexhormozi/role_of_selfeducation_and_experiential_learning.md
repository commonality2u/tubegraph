From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The speaker emphasizes that getting out of difficult financial situations requires taking personal responsibility and utilizing available resources, primarily time, to acquire skills through self-education and practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. This approach contrasts with relying solely on traditional self-help advice, especially for those experiencing significant pain or anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.

## Personal Journey of Learning by Doing

Having experienced financial hardship, including struggling to pay rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and a past goal of making $10,000 a month income 13 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, the speaker missed his twenties in a traditional sense due to hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. He started his first brick-and-mortar business at 23 with almost no knowledge, not even aware he could hire employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. This forced him to handle all aspects of the business himself, from cleaning to billing, sales, teaching, and equipment repair, due to lack of knowledge and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.

This hands-on experience taught crucial skills like dealing with difficult situations to secure sales, such as closing a deal while a child drew on the wall with permanent marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:04">[04:27:04]</a>. These practical skills are developed through direct action and necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:60">[04:37:60]</a>.

## Time as the Primary Investment

For individuals with limited financial resources, time is their most significant asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:35">[04:47:35]</a>. Success requires "brute force" and a tremendous amount of "soul-driving energy" beyond normal daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:60">[05:07:60]</a>. This means living one person's normal life *plus* an additional "workday" dedicated to getting ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:40">[05:21:40]</a>. It's about enduring pain today to get ahead tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:86">[05:35:86]</a>. This difficult "glass period" of intense effort must be pushed through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:90">[05:57:90]</a>.

The speaker's own experience reflects this: he moved across the country, knew no one, and dedicated his free time, particularly Saturdays after work, to learning how to sell and market his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:60">[07:01:60]</a>. This involved sacrificing leisure activities, like watching football, which represented a tie to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:20">[07:20:20]</a>.

## Prioritizing Skills Over Immediate Earnings

Wealthy individuals prioritize acquiring skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:11">[29:16:11]</a>. They view money as a means to gain more skills and, eventually, to buy other people's time and expertise by hiring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:55">[29:40:55]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_learning_over_earning_for_young_peoples_success | importance of learning over earning]].

The first $100,000 is the hardest to earn, taking the speaker five years, and often involves saving dollar by dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:66">[11:23:66]</a>. While there are smarter ways to make money, like selling high-value items, it's difficult for someone broke to immediately achieve such sales, as it requires [[identity_and_personal_transformation | becoming a different person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:81">[12:05:81]</a>. Many people seek complex money-making schemes online without mastering basic foundational skills like showing up on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:92">[12:19:92]</a>. The basics are simpler to understand but not necessarily simpler to *do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:26">[12:41:26]</a>. This connects to the [[approach_to_learning_selfimprovement_and_mastering_skills | approach to learning self-improvement and mastering skills]].

The foundational steps for getting ahead involve:
1.  Acknowledging personal responsibility ("it's my fault") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:98">[25:48:98]</a>.
2.  Spending less than you make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:77">[25:51:77]</a>.
3.  Reinvesting all excess funds into making more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:33">[25:54:33]</a>.

Saving your way to wealth is unlikely if you're on minimum wage; instead, the focus should be on learning skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:40">[26:41:40]</a>.

## Learning Through "Experience Points"

The speaker emphasizes that money spent on self-education and experiments is not lost, even if it doesn't immediately yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:07">[27:39:07]</a>. Failed ventures provide "experience points" which are invaluable for leveling up and achieving desired income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:95">[27:57:95]</a>. This perspective highlights the value of [[investing_in_selfeducation_and_skills_development | investing in self-education and skills development]].

The ability to learn is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:87">[10:41:87]</a>. The speaker, who was good at school, treated business as another form of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:55">[27:26:55]</a>. This perspective aligns with [[lifelong_learning_and_cyclical_nature_of_success | lifelong learning]].

## Avenues for Making Money: Selling Stuff or Skills

Money is made by giving something valuable to someone else who voluntarily exchanges money for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:94">[30:20:94]</a>. This can involve selling:
*   **Stuff**: Providing convenience by sourcing products and selling them at a margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:97">[31:10:97]</a>. Learning to sell someone else's product through affiliate programs is a great starting point for acquiring the skill of selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:88">[31:50:88]</a>.
*   **Skills/Outcomes**: Developing expertise and selling the results of that expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:07">[32:07:07]</a>. The speaker's first paid experience was providing nutrition advice based on his personal fitness achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:08">[33:43:08]</a>.

## The Progression of Skill Development

The speaker's career trajectory illustrates a consistent pattern of self-education and skill development:
1.  **Learn something, get good at it**: E.g., getting in shape and achieving state records in powerlifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:77">[33:51:77]</a>.
2.  **Demonstrate evidence of mastery**: People then ask for help in that area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:68">[33:55:68]</a>.
3.  **Start a business around that skill**: Transitioning from helping individuals to creating a business around fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:75">[33:59:75]</a>.
4.  **Master the business aspect**: As the business grows (e.g., from one gym to six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:49">[34:56:49]</a>), others in the same industry seek advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:60">[34:03:60]</a>.
5.  **Expand expertise to broader business principles**: As businesses grow to national scale, others inquire about scaling and general business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:69">[34:15:69]</a>.

This iterative process shows that the path is revealed through taking steps, not by knowing the entire journey from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:40">[35:21:40]</a>.

## Foundational Mindset for Learning and Growth

The absolute first step to personal growth and financial improvement is accepting that "it's my fault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:87">[13:58:87]</a>. This means owning all past pain, missed opportunities, and decisions, rather than blaming external factors like family, circumstances, or politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:44">[14:23:44]</a>. Blaming external factors gives away personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:87">[14:38:87]</a>. Without this foundation of self-responsibility, any efforts to learn skills like sales or marketing will crumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:07">[17:09:07]</a>. This emphasizes the [[challenges_of_educational_systems_and_personal_responsibility | challenges of educational systems and personal responsibility]] and the need for personal accountability.

The next step is to "use what you have, not what you wish you had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:94">[36:31:94]</a>. This includes using emotions like anger, sadness, or pain as fuel for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:07">[37:09:07]</a>. Making money, even if driven by negative emotions, can significantly improve life by providing the ability to deal with inconveniences and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:93">[37:26:93]</a>. Money doesn't buy happiness but helps avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:91">[37:34:91]</a>.

Finally, as one embarks on this path, external opinions, especially from those who aren't on a similar journey, must be disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:48">[47:10:48]</a>. This includes being willing to "shed" friendships that decrease the possibility of reaching goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:25">[42:42:25]</a>. This period can be lonely, but loneliness provides the necessary time for learning and skill acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:19">[45:51:19]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_starting_personal_growth_and_learning_early | importance of starting personal growth and learning early]] and the [[the_role_of_longterm_investment_in_personal_growth | role of long-term investment in personal growth]].

Making the first $100,000 is often considered the hardest amount of money to make in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This sentiment is echoed by figures like Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, who stated that "the first hundred grand is a bitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Reasons the First $100k is the Hardest

### 1. Limiting Opportunities to "Time for Money" Vehicles
When the goal is set at $100,000, individuals often limit their thinking to opportunities that primarily involve selling their time for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This approach is inherently constraining because personal time is finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

In contrast, aiming for a much larger sum, like $10 million, forces a different operational mindset. One cannot simply multiply a $100k approach by 100 to reach $10 million; it requires entirely different business models that do not rely on selling time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, it's worth noting that most successful individuals who have made millions likely started with something that helped them achieve their first $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Leverage
When starting a business with limited capital, there is often a lack of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This means individuals have to do everything themselves, leading to significant inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This initial phase requires learning every aspect of the business to generate the first dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Most businesses operate on arbitrage, buying something at a lower price and selling it higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In a service business, this might involve buying labor and selling it at a higher price by adding value through training or systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Without money, this leverage is impossible to achieve, demanding immense personal time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Transformative Impact of the First $100k

Despite the [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | challenges of becoming successful]], achieving the first $100,000 can be profoundly meaningful. For the speaker, having $100,000 in the bank provided a significant sense of relief and security, akin to having three and a half years of financial runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This milestone represented a 100x increase from a starting point of $1,000, offering a proportional feeling of security that even $10 million in the bank didn't fully replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

It's normal for the beginning to be hard, but it gets better as one starts to think differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Leveraging Success: Beyond the First $100k

Once the initial $100,000 is achieved, new opportunities arise. This capital allows for:
*   **Hiring Help**: Paying people to perform tasks, freeing up personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Investing in Growth**: Funding advertising, improving marketing materials, or setting up more efficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Gaining Leverage**: With capital, one can "move the world a lot faster" by employing teams for outbound sales or advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Strategic Outsourcing and Skill Development
The process of growing a business involves "piecemealing out pieces of your day" by outsourcing lower-value tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For example, administrative work like scheduling might be outsourced for a low hourly rate, freeing up valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

However, a common mistake is outsourcing without replacing that time with higher-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To grow, entrepreneurs must continually engage in higher and higher-value, higher-leverage activities with the time they buy back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is key to [[challenges_and_lessons_in_scaling_a_business | scaling a business]].

### Thinking Bigger: Unlocking New Vehicles
To achieve goals like $1 million or $10 million, it's essential to consider different "vehicles" or business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. If one doesn't know these vehicles, research existing opportunities is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

For instance, in the United States, a phlebotomist certification can be obtained in one day, allowing individuals to make $25 an hour â€“ more than triple minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Such "mini certifications" can immediately provide more leverage on time for those [[starting_a_business_with_limited_skills_and_resources | starting a business with limited skills and resources]] or working a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This highlights the importance of seeking out and leveraging knowledge that others might be "ignorant" of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Skill Stacking and Raising the "Baseline"
Viewing the entrepreneurial journey as a process of skill stacking increases personal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Failures are then seen not as setbacks, but as lessons on the path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Each acquired skill raises one's "basement" or lowest possible earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

For example:
*   **Sales Skill**: Knowing how to sell can ensure an income of at least $250,000 a year, as one could always sell cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Marketing Skill**: Combining sales with marketing allows for the generation of demand at will, potentially raising the baseline earning to $3 million a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

The speed of skill acquisition depends on deliberate practice, volume of work, and seeking mentors or experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Paying to acquire valuable skills can significantly accelerate the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This is part of a broader [[blueprint_for_becoming_a_millionaire | blueprint for becoming a millionaire]].

## The "Busy and Broke" Conundrum
A key principle is that "you can't be busy and broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. If busy, one should be making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. If broke, there should be time to invest in income-generating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. If someone feels busy and broke, it often indicates wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This mindset helps in [[overcoming_initial_setbacks_in_entrepreneurship | overcoming initial setbacks in entrepreneurship]].

### Conclusion
The first $100,000 is challenging because it often requires a direct trade of time for money and a lack of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. However, by biting the bullet and putting in the effort, individuals can then level up their skill set, pay for accelerated growth, and outsource lower-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This process builds a foundation of skills that can lead to identifying and capitalizing on much larger opportunities, ultimately fostering an [[entrepreneurial_mindset_for_100_million | entrepreneurial mindset for 100 million]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

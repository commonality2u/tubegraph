The majority of millionaires are made through [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with billionaires, who are primarily made in private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The moneymaking process used in [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] accelerates value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How Real Estate Creates Wealth

When investing in [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]], specifically a house, money is typically made in two primary ways:
1.  **Appreciation** The value of the house increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, a house worth one million dollars could become worth two million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Rental Income** Receiving monthly checks from tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This "production from a renter" provides regular income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

If you own your own home, you primarily make money through appreciation, as you are either not paying rent or paying a mortgage to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Types of Appreciation

Appreciation in [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] can occur in two forms:
*   **Natural Appreciation** Value increases simply over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Forced Appreciation** Value is increased by performing work, such as fixing things, cleaning, or adding amenities like a kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This makes the property more appealing and increases its potential sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Real Estate Investment

[[real_estate_investment_strategies | Real estate]] is a simple business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Investors buy a house, make a down payment, and take a loan for the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The goal is to place a tenant who can cover the loan payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

[[real_estate_investment_strategies | Real estate]] is generally considered a reliable investment because land is finite ("they're not making any more land") and the population tends to grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This reliability has historically provided returns over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

While simplified, [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] investment carries risks, and many people have lost money in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

A significant risk to [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] value is population decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For example, Japan's [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] market has declined due to its decreasing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It's important to recognize that population growth is not always guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

When purchasing [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]], it's advisable to buy in areas where the population is growing or increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Comparison with Private Equity

[[real_estate_investment_strategies | Real estate]] has an "upside limit" compared to private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It's unlikely to achieve a 100x return in [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]], whereas this can happen regularly in private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. A key difference is that you cannot relocate a house to a more valuable neighborhood, like Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Another distinction is the ability to start with almost no capital. While building a house from scratch costs money, a business can be started with almost nothing, selling time and generating cash flow from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This allows for the potential of starting with zero cost and becoming worth billions, which is not possible with [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

The reason private equity at the highest levels makes more money than [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] is because it requires a wider range of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

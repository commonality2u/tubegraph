From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The strategies for attracting potential customers, or "leads," are broadly applicable across diverse sectors such as real estate, medical, auto, healthcare, local businesses, home services, financial services, consumer services, software, e-learning, online businesses, e-commerce, and any venture that sells products or services [00:00:09]. These strategies are proven effective, having been utilized in various portfolio companies including software, local businesses, e-commerce, consumer services, medical, and professional home services [00:00:27].

## The Importance of Advertising and Leads
To grow a business, it is essential to inform potential customers about your offerings [00:07:07]. If no one knows about your products or services, they cannot buy them [00:07:09]. Advertising is crucial because it allows strangers to discover what you sell [00:09:34]. An increase in leads directly correlates to business growth; all else being equal, doubling leads can double your business [00:07:29].

The ability to consistently generate leads offers endless opportunities for businesses to succeed, even if they make mistakes, have a less-than-perfect product, or are not strong in sales [00:09:51]. In essence, knowing how to acquire leads is a valuable skill that provides second chances in the challenging business world [00:09:56].

## The Core Four Advertising Methods
There are four primary ways individuals can let others know about their offerings, known as the "Core Four" [00:28:51]:

1.  **Warm Outreach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>
2.  **Posting Free Content** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>
3.  **Running Paid Ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>
4.  **Cold Outreach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>

### 1. Warm Outreach
Warm outreach involves directly reaching out to people who already know you, on a one-to-one basis [00:12:20].

#### Learning Warm Outreach
The speaker's first business, a fitness non-profit called "The Free Training Project," was started by asking 101 friends if they knew anyone interested in getting in shape [00:11:07]. Out of thousands of contacts, six people said yes, donated to charity, and received online training, eventually becoming direct paying clients [00:11:53]. This method helped the speaker transition from an unfulfilling career to entrepreneurship [00:12:28].

#### Modern Application
This method remains effective for launching new products or acquiring initial customers [00:13:00]. It can be implemented immediately through various channels like email, phone calls, direct messages, physical mail, voicemails, or any one-on-one communication [00:13:19].

### 2. Posting Free Content
This strategy involves posting content to a known audience, one-to-many [00:15:39].

#### Learning to Post Content
After acquiring initial clients through warm outreach, the speaker sought to expand by making public posts [00:13:40]. An early advertisement on Facebook detailed the free training project and invited interested individuals to a new website [00:14:15]. By consistently posting fitness content and client testimonials, the speaker messaged anyone who interacted with the posts, leading to 20 new clients at $200 per month, generating $4,000 monthly [00:15:05].

#### Modern Application
The "Hook, Retain, Reward" framework is used to maximize engagement with content, encouraging clicks, consumption, and return visits [00:16:54].

[!INFO] **Hook, Retain, Reward Framework**
This framework ensures content captures attention (hook), keeps viewers engaged (retain), and provides value or satisfies their initial interest (reward) [00:16:54].

For a book launch, content was planned months in advance, resulting in 143 total lead posts and 2,200 total posts across platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube [00:15:51]. This strategy generated over 400 million impressions and 194,000 registrations for an event, equating to approximately $3 million per month in free advertising value [00:16:44]. The principle is to continue posting regular content while adding promotional content on top, rather than replacing it [00:16:26].

Content can be scaled from one post a week to 250 posts a week and utilized on platforms such as YouTube Shorts, YouTube Longs, podcasts, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram [00:17:51].

### 3. Running Paid Ads
Paid advertising involves letting strangers know about your offerings, one-to-many, through paid channels [00:21:27].

#### Learning Paid Ads
Initially, the speaker attempted to replicate a gym owner's success with Groupon, which involved getting 100 new customers for $39 and converting 40% to $150/month recurring revenue [00:18:32]. This attempt failed, leading to a desperate situation with a signed lease and no customers [00:19:13]. Attending a marketing seminar introduced the speaker to Facebook ads [00:19:43].

An initial, "ugliest ad" (a text-only offer for a free six-week challenge in exchange for testimonials) generated 29 members before the gym even opened, providing just enough cash to cover the first month's rent [00:20:04]. This early success with paid ads allowed the speaker to survive and grow the gym, eventually leading to its sale [00:20:48].

[!SUCCESS] **Impact of Paid Ads**
Learning to run paid ads provided the ability to survive long enough to figure out business operations, preventing early failure [00:21:17].

#### Modern Application
For a book launch, paid ads were run on YouTube Shorts, YouTube Longs, Facebook, Instagram Reels, Instagram Stories, Instagram Posts, and TikTok [00:21:39]. These ads, scripted using a simple "What, Who, When" framework from the book, resulted in 137,000 registrations at a cost of approximately $2 per lead from a $275,000 spend [00:21:56]. The landing page used had a 55% opt-in rate [00:22:25].

Paid ads are the fastest way to acquire leads, especially for new businesses with no existing audience or reputation [00:22:59]. They can be started with a small budget (a few dollars a day) and scaled significantly, with the speaker's portfolio companies spending over $1 million per week on ads [00:23:10]. Paid advertising is simpler than often portrayed; complexity arises from a lack of clear understanding [00:23:22].

### 4. Cold Outreach
Cold outreach involves privately letting people who don't know you know about your offerings, one-to-one [00:26:45].

#### Learning Cold Outreach
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 100% of the speaker's gym licensing company's clients were forced to halt business, leading to a 30% permanent closure rate for gyms and failing ads [00:24:32]. A cold message from an individual seeking a sales role, who previously worked at a gym software company using 100% outbound sales, led to his hire [00:25:05].

This individual built an outbound machine that generated significant sales, starting from zero and reaching $480,000 in monthly revenue within nine months [00:25:58]. This method was pivotal in saving the company during a difficult period and making it a sellable entity [00:26:21]. Today, cold outbound accounts for over 50% of sales for the company, which is up 45% since being sold [00:26:33].

#### Modern Application
For the book launch, cold outreach was used to secure podcast appearances to speak about the book [00:26:58]. This is an advanced move that combines two advertising types [00:27:06].

Cold outreach can involve knocking on doors, sending DMs, making calls, or leaving voicemails [00:27:18]. The key is to find a way to contact them, know what to say, and persist until they are ready to listen [00:27:25]. Platforms include SMS, DMs, emails, LinkedIn Messenger, Instagram Messenger, Twitter Messenger, voicemail, and physical mail [00:27:33].

This method can start with a tiny budget, requiring primarily time, contact information, and effective messaging [00:27:43]. It can be scaled through automation and leveraging other people's time [00:27:50]. A significant advantage is the ability to select specific, highly qualified leads, such as hedge fund managers with over a billion dollars in assets [00:27:57]. The speaker's portfolio companies collectively execute over 15,000 reach-outs per day, generating numerous engaged leads [00:28:14].

## Leveraging Others: The Four Lead Getters
While individuals can utilize the Core Four methods, the most efficient way to advertise is to have "Lead Getters" do it on your behalf [00:30:05]. These are other people who can extend your reach [00:29:19]. There are four types of lead getters:

1.  **Customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>
2.  **Employees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>
3.  **Agencies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>
4.  **Affiliates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>

Lead Getters use the Core Four methods, creating a cycle where, for example, free content generates customers who then use warm outreach to bring in more customers [00:29:36]. This approach shifts the workload from high to low for the business owner, while increasing leads and leverage significantly [00:30:21].

### 5. Customers (Referrals)
Customers who refer new clients are a powerful source of leads. The speaker's previous book, "100 Million Dollar Offers," sold 467,000 copies with zero paid ads, primarily through customer referrals [00:31:51]. This demonstrates how existing customers can organically attract more business [00:31:56].

### 6. Employees
Employees can perform Core Four activities on behalf of the company. For example, the speaker's media team (MOZI media) created 143 book posts and over 2,200 pieces of content in six weeks to promote an event [00:32:23].

### 7. Agencies
Agencies can be hired to run ads, post content, or conduct outreach. For the current event, an agency was responsible for clicking buttons and running ads for the holding company, as the holding company itself does not directly transact [00:32:50].

### 8. Affiliates
Affiliates are independent businesses that promote your products to their audience [00:33:57]. They differ from referrals in that they have their own businesses and advertising efforts, agreeing to offer your products in exchange for compensation or free items [00:58:24].

Affiliates provide significant leverage: selling 10 affiliates who each bring one customer per month can lead to exponential growth compared to directly selling to 10 customers per month [00:59:09]. This method can lead to massive profits and is often free, as you attach your offer to theirs [00:59:23].

The speaker's supplement company, Prestige Labs, generated $1.7 million per month in its first full month using 100 affiliates with zero paid ads [01:01:26]. This strategy was learned after a prior affiliate launch failed, leading to documentation of mistakes and subsequent success [01:01:51]. This process has since generated $75 million in sales from affiliates across the speaker's portfolio [01:01:58]. For the current event, 23,722 affiliates promoted it, bringing in over 104,361 attendees [01:02:07].

## The 100 Million Dollar Leads System

The speaker offers a comprehensive system based on a decade of advertising experience and four years of work, designed to master all eight lead generation methods [00:36:51].

This system is designed to help businesses improve replies, opt-ins, webpage conversions, build trust, and reduce lead costs [00:37:27].

### Components of the System:

    *   **Combined Value (Stated)**: $3291 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>

4.  **The Cold Outreach Playbook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>
    *   **Purpose**: For those who prefer not to be on camera or create extensive content, and want consistent sales despite changing algorithms [00:47:50].
    *   **Impact**: Allows for discreet operations, provides reliable lead generation through volume, makes businesses resilient, and can increase business value by 5x [00:48:04]. It ensures a consistent supply of leads, allowing business owners to "sleep well at night" [00:48:41].
    *   **Case Study**: Miguel used this playbook for his local business, adding outbound efforts that led to his first $100,000/month within 90 days, effectively doubling his revenue [00:48:44]. This playbook was the largest contributor to the speaker's $46.2 million exit during COVID [00:50:15].
    *   **Teaches**: How to acquire lead contact information (buying, scraping, manual assembly), what to say (exact scripts for voicemails, emails, DMs, follow-ups, warm-ups, personalization at scale), and how to contact them efficiently (automating delivery and distribution for more replies and optimal follow-up sequences) [00:49:09].
    *   **Value (Stated)**: $1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>

5.  **The Paid Ads Playbook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>
    *   **Purpose**: For those seeking rapid lead generation with a higher risk tolerance and aiming for efficient scaling with minimal human resources [00:51:24].
    *   **Impact**: Considered "the closest thing to legally printing money," consistently works, allows for increased reach by simply increasing spend, doesn't require an audience or reputation, enables testing with tiny budgets, and is simpler than often perceived [00:51:37]. It can lead to massive wealth changes and potentially 100x a business [00:52:27]. The speaker's bank account went from $854 in 2016 to $1,000,000 in income within 24 months by cracking paid ads [00:52:09].
    *   **Teaches**: Where to advertise, how to target the right audience, how to create effective ads (following timeless human behavior patterns), and how to gain permission to contact leads [00:52:45].
    *   **Value (Stated)**: $1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>

6.  **The Referral Playbook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>
    *   **Purpose**: For those who prioritize building great products, creating lasting businesses, nurturing customer relationships, and maximizing profit margins [00:54:41]. A referral occurs when a customer sends an engaged lead to your business [00:54:54].
    *   **Impact**: Referrals are more valuable and cost less to acquire, leading to compounding growth and potentially "crazy profits" [00:55:04]. Growing infinitely only requires getting more customers to refer than those who exit [00:55:31].
    *   **Case Study**: This playbook generated $300,000 per week in sales for Gym Launch, discovered accidentally when ads were temporarily shut off but sales continued [00:55:40]. The speaker reverse-engineered this, identifying six common factors among top businesses that tripled customer retention and referrals [00:55:47]. Vadim implemented one referral program, gaining 105 people and adding $28,000 to annual revenue for free [00:57:04].
    *   **Teaches**: How to optimize the referral percentage to churn percentage ratio, how to encourage referrals without direct asking (by picking better customers, setting expectations, delivering faster results, improving the product, and guiding next purchases), and how to ask effectively (seven proven referral programs) [00:56:15].
    *   **Value (Stated)**: $997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>
    *   **Combined Value (Stated)**: $8282 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>

7.  **The Affiliate Playbook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>
    *   **Purpose**: For those who enjoy building relationships, believe in expanding opportunities, and seek to create long-term alliances [00:57:58].
    *   **Impact**: Allows leveraging other businesses' advertising efforts, leading to compounded revenue growth with the same amount of direct effort [00:59:17]. It's a "free" method where you attach your offer to an affiliate's offer [01:00:10].
    *   **Case Study**: The speaker's second attempt at launching affiliates resulted in $75 million in sales [01:01:58]. This exact process led to 23,722 affiliates promoting the current event [01:02:05].
    *   **Teaches**: How to identify ideal affiliates, create win-win offers (where both parties and the affiliate's audience benefit), train affiliates to sell, determine appropriate compensation (including payment program structures), activate their advertising efforts, and sustain long-term engagement [01:00:36].
    *   **Value (Stated)**: $1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>
    *   **Combined Value (Stated)**: $10,279 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>

8.  **The Zero to 100 Million Dollar Scaling Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>
    *   **Purpose**: A "gauntlet" that outlines the seven levels of scaling leads and advertising, providing clarity on which playbook to use and in what order for a specific business stage [01:03:41].
    *   **Impact**: Guides the scaling process to achieve a "100 Million Dollar Leads Machine" where media teams generate vast free content, warm audiences receive offers, paid ads are profitable, cold outreach is automated, affiliate managers integrate partners, recruiters bring in more lead getters, products generate referrals, and the executive team drives growth independently [01:04:09]. The speaker's business crossed $10 million per month using this roadmap, which cost a decade of experience and mistakes to develop [01:05:01].
    *   **Value (Stated)**: $1797 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>
    *   **Total System Value (Stated)**: $12,076 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a> (though the speaker offers it for free as a gift to the audience [01:09:53])

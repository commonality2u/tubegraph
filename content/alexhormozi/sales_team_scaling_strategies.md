Scaling a sales team is one of the most difficult tasks for businesses, especially when aiming for the first million or three million dollars per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A major bottleneck is onboarding new sales personnel and ensuring they sell at the same or better percentage as experienced representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article outlines three frameworks that have been successfully used to [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | scale sales teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Key Frameworks for Scaling Sales

Three core frameworks can transform sales funnels into profitable systems: the Closer Framework, the Conviction Framework, and the [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | Scaling Framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### 1. The Closer Framework: Question-Based Scripting

The Closer Framework is a question-based sales scripting process designed to make funnels profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It works across various sales types, including B2C and B2B, and for ticket sizes ranging from $500 to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The acronym C.L.O.S.E.R. simplifies the process:

*   **C - Clarify why they are there:** Understand the prospect's goal and what prompted them to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Examples questions include: "What made you come in today?", "What's your goal right now?", and "Why is that important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **L - Label them with a problem:** Get the prospect to acknowledge a problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Rephrase what is heard to confirm understanding, e.g., "So what I'm hearing is XYZ, does that sound about right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **O - Overview what they've tried:** This involves gathering intel on past attempts to solve their problem through a "pain cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Questions include: "What have you tried so far to accomplish that?", "How long did you do that for?", and "Had that worked for you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **S - Sell them a vacation:** The sales pitch should be brief, ideally under three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Focus on what the prospect will *experience* (the "Maui" or final destination), not *how* they will experience it (the "plane flight" or modules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Identify three core benefits of the product/service and have a memorized 30-second story for each, to address potential hesitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **E - Explain away their concerns:** Address common objections such as price, stalls, and needing to consult a decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   **Price objections:** If someone says "I can't afford it," it often means they don't understand the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Help the sales team understand that if the value is clear, the prospect will find a way to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
    *   **Decision-maker objections:**
        1.  **Circumvent:** Ask what they would do if the decision-maker said no; often, they would proceed anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
        2.  **Divert:** Ask what the decision-maker's biggest objection would be to address it directly, even if they aren't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
        3.  **Past Agreements:** Reference prior agreements or struggles that the decision-maker already doesn't approve of, making it logical to solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
        4.  **Forgiveness over Permission:** Offer to process the payment with a delayed charge, allowing the prospect to consult with the decision-maker and challenge illogical objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   **Stalls:** Teach prospects how to make decisions on the call by outlining variables to consider, such as whether the product meets their needs, increases likelihood of success, and if they want to work with the team and have access to funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **R - Reinforce the decision:** This transitions into the onboarding process to increase customer lifetime value (LTV), lower churn, and reduce refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Actions include sending a personalized video from the CEO to welcome and thank the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### 2. The Conviction Framework: Mastering Tone

The Conviction Framework emphasizes that anyone with belief can outperform a seasoned sales representative by simply learning to control their tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Sales involve two dialogues: words (logic) and tone (emotion), with emotion driving decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. "How you say what you say is what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

While tone can be trained deliberately (e.g., raising voice to imply a question or lowering for importance), it can also be "tricked" into correctness through genuine conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. If a salesperson truly believes in what they sell, their tone will naturally be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Lack of conviction can cause performance to tank, even for previously successful reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

To build and maintain conviction within a sales team:
*   **Read testimonials aloud daily:** This reminds salespeople of the positive impact they are making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Fix and improve the product:** Continuously work on the product or service to maintain belief in its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Involve customer support:** Have customer support share their positive experiences with clients in sales meetings to boost team morale and understanding of product value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Study "hot" streaks:** Analyze recordings of when a salesperson is performing exceptionally well to identify and replicate their winning patterns and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

### 3. The Scaling Framework: The Six C's for Duplication

The [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | Scaling Framework]] provides a systematic approach to duplicate sales processes across a team in seven days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This framework has helped build a 3,000-person affiliate base and added $35 million in sales for a physical products company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. The emphasis is on educating sales personnel about the *prospect*, not just the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

The six C's for [[scaling_a_servicebased_business | scaling sales teams]] are:

1.  **Closer Sequence:** Ensure the core sales script is a question-based framework, making it easy to follow and redirect conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
2.  **Consistent Daily [[sales_training_and_development | Training]] and Conviction:** Implement daily training sessions focusing on both speaking and listening skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
    *   **Talking:** Have reps read the script aloud for 25 minutes daily, focusing on correct tonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
    *   **Obstacle Overcomes:** Drill common objections for five minutes daily so reps can respond without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
    *   **Listening:** Listen to 30-minute call recordings daily and conduct "game tape review" to analyze what went right, what went wrong, and what to do next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
3.  **Call Recordings:** Record all sales calls for compliance and to create "game film" for training purposes, similar to how sports teams review their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Tools like Gong provide valuable analytics on talk time, questions asked, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
4.  **Communication Cycles and Feedback:** Provide targeted, one-on-one feedback focusing on one area for improvement at a time to prevent overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Implement weekly team meetings, daily training, and daily wrap-ups for motivation and positive reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
5.  **Cuts:** Quickly identify and remove underperforming salespeople within the first one to two weeks, especially if the product is not overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. It's often easier to improve a moderately performing salesperson than to significantly raise a poor performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
6.  **Competition and Career Path:**
    *   **Competition:** Leverage the competitive nature of salespeople with regular competitions, ideally in six-week cycles to maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Group competitions (e.g., teams of four) foster camaraderie alongside competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
    *   **Career Path:** Provide clear milestones and incremental increases in compensation or roles to show progress in a repetitive role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
    *   **Specialization:** Separate outbound and inbound sales teams, and further specialize with setters and closers for each, as prospects differ significantly, leading to higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

By implementing these frameworks, businesses can effectively onboard new sales talent and [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | scale sales operations]] to achieve significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

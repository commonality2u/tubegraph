This article provides advice for individuals in challenging financial situations, focusing on strategies to [[importance_of_skill_development | develop valuable skills]] and secure better employment opportunities. The advice is framed as a guide for "Avante," a young man working two jobs, supporting a one-year-old child, and expressing a desire to escape poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Financial Advancement
The fundamental approach to getting ahead involves developing something of value that others desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Currently, individuals with low skills primarily trade time, which is an inefficient way to generate significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Therefore, the main objective is to create time to [[approach_to_learning_selfimprovement_and_mastering_skills | learn a valuable skill]] while still providing for family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> "The only way you're going to get out of your surroundings is by having something of value that other people want, and right now the only thing you have is your time with low skills to trade, which is a hard game to play. You have to trade a lot of it only to get a little." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

### Rejecting Luck
It's essential to operate under the assumption that luck is not a factor for oneself; success must be manufactured through diligent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

> "Volume negates luck." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>

## Strategic Steps to Improve Your Situation

### 1. Drastically Cut All Costs
This step requires extreme discipline, eliminating all non-essential expenses for a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Food**: No eating out; only purchase from discount grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Clothing**: Use existing clothes for at least two years; reuse, trade, or buy from Goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Housing**: Live with family (parents) or share housing with other families to minimize rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The goal is to spend money only on food and shelter, dropping other expenses to the greatest degree possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### 2. Increase Income and Learn a New Skill
While currently working two jobs, allocate free time to pursue better opportunities and [[investing_in_selfeducation_and_skills_development | skill development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Job Search**: Apply to jobs that align more with long-term goals. Entry-level remote phone sales roles can pay $40,000+ annually without prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Flexible Income**: If possible, drive for Uber for flexible hours and immediate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. If without a car, save up to purchase a cheap, reliable one in cash (e.g., $5,000-$10,000) to avoid payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation for Learning**: Dedicate a specific, consistent amount of time (e.g., 4 hours daily) to learn one specific high-value skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This requires intense focus, using a timer, and avoiding distractions like "doom scrolling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Initial progress can be made quickly (e.g., 20 hours for basics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Free resources like books, courses, and online content can be utilized for [[investing_in_education_and_skills_development | skill acquisition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### 3. Mastering the Job Application Process
Once basic skills are acquired, the focus shifts to becoming an undeniable job candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Create a LinkedIn profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. When applying, send personalized messages to multiple individuals (HR, talent director, etc.) at each company. Avoid generic copy-pasted messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Craft personalized cover letters by researching the company's website and tailoring it to the specific job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Hustle**: For entry-level roles, hustle often matters more than prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Show willingness to go above and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **High-Volume Applications**: Apply to a high volume of positions (e.g., 1000 places over 6 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This "volume negates luck" principle applies to applications too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **In-Person Follow-up**: For highly desired roles, consider visiting the workplace after your shift to express enthusiasm directly and politely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### 4. Excel Once Hired
Once a job is secured, work harder than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **"Kobe" Mentality**: Emulate the dedication of top performers. Just as Kobe Bryant practiced three times a day when others did one or two, identify what the top performer in your role does and do twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The goal is to surpass, not just match, their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Sustained Effort**: This level of intensity is not for a week or a month, but for a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This intense "season" of effort will lead to long-term financial stability and the ability to provide desired opportunities for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Mindset and Overcoming Obstacles
### Redefining Sadness and Ignorance
Stress and hopelessness often stem from a lack of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This feeling should be reframed as "ignorance, not sadness," meaning there is a lack of knowledge that can be controlled and acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### The Value of Rejection
Rejection is not a loss; it's an opportunity for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   Getting rejected 1,000 times means gaining 1,000 experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   When attempting something, you either learn or you win, meaning you win by default through action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   Being willing to be rejected by strangers unlocks significant money and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. One "yes" can transform an entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Managing External Influence
*   **Information Diet**: Actively ignore advice from those in poor financial situations, as listening to them will likely keep you poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Prioritize consuming content that supports your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Evaluate relationships based on whether they help you achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. People who don't have bigger dreams for you than you do should be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Family Balance**: For a temporary period, individual balance may be sacrificed for family unit balance. For example, one partner might focus on childcare while the other intensely focuses on career growth to benefit the family long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to be "harder than your circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The challenges faced can become a powerful success story, inspiring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

The speaker, who has built six multi-eight-figure companies with his wife in the last five years, discusses his approach to work-life balance and the dynamics of [[working_together_as_a_couple_in_business | working together as a married couple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their current portfolio generates approximately $85 million annually, and they also run acquisition.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Redefining "Work-Life Balance"

The speaker challenges the conventional idea of "work-life balance," stating that one has "one life" lived on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He believes people should optimize for activities they enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If working provides more stimulation than not working, then one should work, and adjustments can be made if undesired trade-offs occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For him, working is enjoyable; he even prefers to work on his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

He suggests that the common saying "do something you love and you'll never work another day in your life" stems from a poor definition of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If one achieves this state, they are simply "living" through their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

In 2021, despite owning multiple companies generating significant cash flow, he was miserable because he "did nothing" and couldn't spend the money he was making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This led to a feeling of pointlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Starting acquisition.com and building its infrastructure brought him immense joy by getting "back into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

He realized that his goal is to "work to create options, not to not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Many people work hard to avoid future work, but he works to have the freedom to choose to work, which is his definition of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Even after achieving financial success where he could not spend all his money, he found that the most meaningful activity was the one that led him there: working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Marriage and Work: The Compromise Debate

The interviewer raises the point that [[working_together_as_a_couple_in_business | marriage]] often requires compromise, especially when a partner's "love language" is quality time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The speaker, however, asserts that "compromise is a belief statement" rather than a fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, stating, "I don't believe that marriage is compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Another individual, Graham, shared his experience:
*   His partner Macy expected work to end by 5 or 6 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Graham's mind works 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   He initially tried to accommodate by waking up early to finish work by 5 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   While productive in the mornings, over time, he felt anxious, uptight, and not himself if he couldn't work during hours he desired, especially when highly focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Relationship Dynamics in Business

The speaker acknowledges his "uncommon" views on relationships, stating they align with his desire for an uncommon life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. He has observed two effective [[different_relationship_dynamics_and_their_impact_on_business | dynamics in relationships]] over extended periods:

1.  **"We're in it together"**: Both partners actively participate in the business or the "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   This dynamic fosters a deep shared respect that is difficult to achieve when one partner doesn't understand the "battlefield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
    *   For example, if one partner needs to work intensely for several days, there's no discussion or negative reaction; it's understood and supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   It is easier to manage this dynamic because the mission and goals are "so clearly stated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

2.  **"Cheerleader and quarterback"**: One partner (the cheerleader) supports the other (the quarterback) in their endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   A true cheerleader "doesn't ask the quarterback to come out when the game's on the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   He warns against "inverted dynamics" where the "cheerleader" might actually be sabotaging the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This dynamic requires a "very aligned mission and goals" for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Managing Familiarity vs. Space in Relationships

Drawing on Esther Perel's work, the speaker explains that initial attraction comes from "mystery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Over time, as couples become more familiar, they gain security, but can "over correct and then you become siblings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This is a "dichotomy to be managed," balancing space and familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

For entrepreneurs, specifically, [[challenges_of_managing_business_and_personal_relationships | relationship challenges]] arise if partners grow apart due to exposure to different stimuli, leading to adaptation and divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

In scenarios like his own, where both partners are "doing the same thing together":
*   These couples tend to make "five times more money than any of the other versions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   However, the downside is the risk of becoming *too* familiar and "just become siblings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   To counteract this, the speaker and his wife intentionally create more space: they work on separate sides of the house and don't attend the same meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This allows them to have new things to discuss at dinner, maintaining an element of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

The speaker notes that the happiest couples are often those with separate, respected careers that are not necessarily together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These couples share goals, values, and respect for one another's ambitions, walking "in parallel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Different relationship dynamics require different "corrections":
*   Couples [[working_together_as_a_couple_in_business | working together]] must "correct for trying to create more familiarity" (i.e., create more space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   Those with one partner as a stay-at-home spouse often see things "go wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Couples with parallel careers tend to be in the "middle" already and simply need to maintain their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Ultimately, the speaker concludes that one doesn't "have to compromise anything if you don't want to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

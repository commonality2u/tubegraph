Alex Hormozi, a business investor and owner of acquisition.com, which oversees a portfolio generating approximately $85 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, attributes his rise from financial hardship to earning over $1 million per month by age 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> to a unique concept he terms the "anti-routine." This approach fundamentally shifts the perspective on [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | productivity]] and [[setting_priorities_for_success | priority setting]], focusing on what to eliminate rather than what to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Anti-Routine Mindset

Many people seek to understand successful individuals' routines, believing there's something specific they *do* that others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Hormozi argues this is a misconception; often, champions succeed because they *lack* something others have, such as an "off switch" that prevents them from stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The anti-routine posits that the most [[time_management and productivity for leaders | productive routine]] involves identifying and stopping activities that should not be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!INFO] Redefining Priority
> True [[importance_of_prioritization_and_strategy_in_achieving_business_goals | prioritization]] means that two things cannot be equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. If time is spent equally on two tasks, neither is truly a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This highlights the inability of most people to say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The overarching theme of the anti-routine is the word "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It's about entering a "season of no" â€“ not necessarily forever, but for a period when hyper-focus is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. If something is a priority, it necessitates saying "no" to everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Unpacking "No" in Different Contexts

### Communication Obligations
A common misconception is that all communication, whether texts or emails, carries an implied obligation to reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Hormozi illustrates this by asking if one would reply to 500,000 texts; the answer is no, because it would be physically impossible to do anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The ability to reply doesn't create an obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. During his 18-month growth period, Hormozi intentionally stopped replying to most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Re-evaluating Social Commitments
Many events, masterminds, and coaching programs primarily serve social needs rather than solving pressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Hormozi attended one mastermind, gained the necessary information, and then didn't return for 18 months, focusing instead on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Once the path to success is known, any activity that isn't direct execution becomes a hindrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Practical Tactics for the Anti-Routine

To implement the anti-routine and eliminate distractions, Hormozi adopted several key tactics:

*   **Changed Phone Number**: He changed his phone number and gave the old one to his assistant, only communicating with people he actively chose to reach out to. This eliminated constant interruptions and requests for meetings or calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Saying "no" to everything created significant blank space in his calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Stopped Attending Events**: Once he knew what needed to be done, he ceased attending events, focusing solely on execution rather than seeking more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Blocked Meeting-Free Work Hours**: From 4 AM to noon daily, he took no meetings and worked uninterrupted on his top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This dedicated time is crucial for founders and early-stage entrepreneurs who often lack the team leverage to delegate significant "doing" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. [[Effective Resource Allocation and Prioritization | Leveraging time appropriately]] is key until team leverage is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule**: He stopped differentiating bedtimes on weekends and weekdays, maintaining a consistent sleep and wake-up time to support his 4 AM to noon work block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Minimalist Health Routines**: During this period, he worked out only twice a week, viewing it as the "minimum effective dose" for maintenance. He prioritized business growth over making progress on multiple fronts, including fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Similarly, he incorporated 1-2 fasting days a week to reduce time spent on food preparation, eating, and cleaning, allowing for uninterrupted work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This demonstrates [[focus_on_quality_for_business_growth | focused allocation of effort]].
*   **Deleted Social Media from Phone**: Recognizing that most social media use is consumption rather than posting, he deleted all social media apps from his phone. Posting could be done from a computer, [[eliminating_nonessential_tasks_for_efficiency | eliminating the significant time drain]] (3-5 hours daily for many) of constant phone-based social media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] The Power of "No"
> Hormozi emphasizes that success isn't about finding a "secret magic routine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>; it's about identifying and stopping the myriad of unproductive activities that hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Entering a "season of no" is essential for achieving outsized returns on [[the_importance_of_prioritization_in_business | productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

By rigorously applying these tactics, Alex Hormozi transformed his financial situation within 18 months, demonstrating the profound impact of strategic [[importance_of_prioritization_and_strategy_in_achieving_business_goals | prioritization]] and the discipline of saying "no" to non-essential tasks.

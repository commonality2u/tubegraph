The composition of one's close circle significantly influences [[foundational_personal_development_for_success | personal growth]] and trajectory toward success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. As individuals evolve, the people surrounding them must also align with their evolving values and aspirations, often leading to a natural shedding of old friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Seasonal Nature of Friendships

Life is often viewed in "seasons" of three to five years, during which personal priorities and identities can drastically change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Historically, individuals have shed friends with each new season of life, maintaining a very small close circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rapid shedding allows for quick personal growth, as one does not hold onto things that no longer provide value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

For example, a transition from high school to college, and then from college to a different life phase, often marks a natural departure from previous social circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The idea that friends must be "friends for life" is a romanticized societal story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, but in reality, relationships don't need to last forever to have been good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## The Price of Greatness and Social Circles

Achieving greatness or uncommon outcomes requires a willingness to pay a significant price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The goal itself doesn't make one unique; it's the willingness to make the necessary sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Most people are not "bound for greatness" due to their choices and inherent characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The societal narrative that implies abandoning old friends means forgetting one's roots is often told by the majority who get left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It is statistically unlikely that friends from childhood will be among the top 1% or 0.1% of people, making it logical for friendships to change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Identity, Labels, and Growth

Past friends often hold an outdated identity of an individual and may reinforce those old labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When someone is growing and evolving, these old labels can be actively "beaten" into them by friends who see personal development as merely "change" rather than growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

It is crucial to have people around who do not believe the lies one used to tell about themselves and who encourage the behaviors and character traits one wishes to cultivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Shedding old identities is a core part of personal development and success, requiring a willingness to declare "I am no longer this way" and "I will no longer behave in this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Relationships as Transactional

All relationships have an exchange where both parties receive something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While the term "transactional" may sound commercial, from a behavioral standpoint, interactions are either reinforced or punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The strength of a relationship can be measured by how long one is willing to wait for positive reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, if positive reinforcement ceases, the relationship will eventually be cut off, regardless of its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The amount of love or liking for someone is directly proportional to what one is willing to sacrifice to maintain that relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This serves as a filter to determine which friends are truly valued and for whom one is willing to sacrifice the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Navigating Difficult Conversations and New Connections

The [[the_challenges_of_changing_social_circles_for_personal_development | challenges of changing social circles for personal development]] often arise from societal stories that label those who move on as "bad friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, letting go of unserving relationships creates space for new friendships that align better with current goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

When a relationship no longer serves, communication can naturally fizzle out by reducing frequency of contact and declining invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If a relationship is too close for this to happen subtly, direct and honest communication is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Being kind means telling the truth, even if it's uncomfortable, which can lead to stronger relationships or clarity on their termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

When old friends no longer align with one's path, they may actively encourage behavior that one is trying to shed, hindering [[impact_of_social_circle_on_financial_success | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It is important to remember that people's judgments about how one spends their time are merely reflections of their own choices, not objective truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

After shedding friends who no longer fit, the next step is to join new communities that align with one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This allows for making new friends who share similar aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. As one progresses within these communities, they can gain status and [[choosing_friends_and_influences_wisely | LeapFrog into other communities]] with higher-achieving individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This process is akin to "lunch tables on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. To live a "rare life," one must be surrounded by "rare people," who by definition are not common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Effective audience targeting is a critical growth lever for businesses, especially those under $1 million in revenue, where most people are unaware of their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Dedicated effort, such as the "Core Four" (Outreach, Content, or Ads), is necessary to move from obscurity to awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Advertising, in particular, can lead to a "boom" or a "business order of magnitude change" by significantly increasing reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Perceiving the Marketplace
Many business owners mistakenly perceive their marketplace as limited, feeling sad when competitors enter and take "half the pie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. In reality, the marketplace is "significantly bigger than you ever give it credit for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. There are countless ways to communicate and reach different segments of the audience across various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. Even in a competitive market, a small percentage of a large audience can make a business incredibly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Audience Engagement

### Shrink Your Competition by Growing Larger
Instead of trying to beat competitors, the strategy is to "shrink your competition" by growing so large that others become irrelevant by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This means building "the biggest absolute building" so your shadow blocks out others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This requires consistent and pervasive outreach, content, and advertising across multiple channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. It's important to remember that most people are unaware of your existence, even if you feel like you're advertising constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. You must become a master of variety in re-saying the same message in different ways, as people need to be reminded more than they need to be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### Clear, Not Clever, Communication
One of the strongest growth levers is to be [[branding_and_audience_engagement | clear, not clever]] in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Research suggests that communicating in simpler language (e.g., at a third-grade level) allows a message to reach a higher percentage of the population by lowering the barrier to comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This doesn't mean talking down to your audience; rather, it helps experts understand more easily and beginners understand for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

To achieve this clarity:
*   **Language Grade Level:** Run your emails, landing pages, and ad copy through a reading grade level app and aim for below fifth grade, or ideally third grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This can lead to significant increases in conversion rates by increasing comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.
*   **Analogies and Stories:** Match analogies to the audience's "history of learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. For a narrow audience (e.g., mechanics or realtors), use industry-specific analogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. For a broader audience, use more universal human experiences like food, sleep, or driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. The broader the audience, the broader the analogy and simpler the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

### [[effective_ad_creation_and_optimization_techniques | Effective Ad Creation and Optimization Techniques]]
[[effective_use_of_advertising_hooks | Hooks]] are paramount. The "hook is greater than everything" because no one will see your proof or offer without a compelling hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. Obsessing over the first few seconds or the headline (as David Ogilvy suggests, "80 cents of your advertising dollar") can drastically increase open rates, click-through rates, and overall engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. A proven hook formula is "Proof, Promise, Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Proof over Promise
While offers are important, "proof is your single highest priority as a business owner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. A product with many positive reviews and moderate claims will outperform a product with bold promises but little social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. Initially, working for free to gather testimonials, reviews, and feedback is crucial for building conviction in your product and collecting positive feedback for advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. The most compelling way to advertise is to "show, don't sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. The messenger (your past achievements) is inextricably linked to the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

### The Power of "More"
A significant growth lever is simply doing "more" of what is already working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>. Instead of constantly seeking new strategies ("shiny object syndrome"), focus on scaling existing successes. This is about going from "one to end" rather than "zero to one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. Doubling outreach, ad spend, or content frequency can yield a 2x, 3x, or even 4x improvement in business results, far exceeding the gains from optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>. Perceived volatility in results is often a symptom of low volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.

### Understanding Word of Mouth
Negative word of mouth is "significantly stronger and faster than positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. A bad experience can be spread to many more people than a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. This can cause customer acquisition costs to rise as fewer people respond to advertising due to negative perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. To combat this, prioritize product quality and actively seek feedback, especially in the early stages, to build positive experiences before widely introducing your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

### Stealing from Yourself
Once something is working, "steal from yourself" by reusing proven concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>. Businesses often get bored of their own effective messages before their customers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>. The ideal allocation of effort is:
*   **70% Carbon Copy:** Replicate what is already working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.
*   **20% Adjacent:** Make slight variations (e.g., same hook, different background) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>.
*   **10% Brand New:** Experiment with completely new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.
Many entrepreneurs mistakenly flip this ratio, spending most of their time on new, untested ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>.

### [[how_to_identify_and_serve_a_target_audience | Identifying and Serving the Ideal Customer]]
The fundamental rule for [[role_of_ad_targeting_in_business_success | ad targeting in business success]] is to **target the correct audience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. Showing an amazing offer to the wrong people (e.g., winter coats in South Florida) will yield no results, regardless of offer quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20:00">[54:20:00]</a>.

#### Methods of Targeting:
*   **Outreach:** Reach out to people who are actively suffering from the problem you solve or have a high likelihood of doing so. The narrower the problem, the smaller and more targeted the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:11:00">[55:11:00]</a>.
*   **Paid Ads:** Ad platforms are successful based on their targeting capabilities. Facebook, for instance, was so effective it felt "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:24:00">[55:24:00]</a>.
*   **Content:** The algorithm serves content based on the creator's appearance, speech, and what they say, influencing who sees it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:44:00">[55:44:00]</a>. To attract a certain avatar, ensure the person in the ad looks like the avatar and that the communication style matches their way of talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:00">[56:37:00]</a>.

> "Fundamentally all marketing works as long as you get the targeting right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>

### Understanding Buyer Information Requirements:
Buyers exist on a continuum:
*   **Low Information Buyers:** These are the "crazy people" who buy immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>. Everyone competes for them, but this pool is significantly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. Direct response marketing targets these buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.
*   **High Information Buyers:** This pool is "multiple orders of magnitude greater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>. They require more information before making a decision. To scale, businesses must educate a higher percentage of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21:00">[39:21:00]</a>.

#### Eugene Schwartz's Five Levels of Awareness:
This framework helps tailor marketing to different audience segments:
1.  **Unaware:** People with no idea about anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:38:00">[39:38:00]</a>. Marketing should focus on broad curiosity (e.g., scientific breakthroughs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Problem Aware:** They have a pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:42:00">[39:42:00]</a>. Marketing addresses specific problems (e.g., "Do you wake up to pee three times a night?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.
3.  **Solution Aware:** They know of potential solutions and need help selecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Product Aware:** Aware of specific products at a micro-level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>.
5.  **Most Aware:** Typically existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>. Direct offers work best here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

#### Balancing Give vs. Ask (70/30 Rule):
To reach broader audiences and grow a brand, a critical balance is needed. New Balance, for example, successfully flipped their advertising budget from 30% broad awareness/70% direct sales to **70% broad awareness/30% direct sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>. This strategy focuses on "giving" value (storytelling, endorsements, education) rather than constantly "asking" for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>. While the return may take time (e.g., 18 months for New Balance), it builds a sustainable, compounding "snowball" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>.

*   **B2C Businesses:** Achieve this ratio through emotional stories, associations, endorsements from athletes and influencers, aligning product with values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
*   **B2B Businesses:** Focus on sharing aspirational outcomes you or your business have achieved, outcomes your avatar has achieved with your help, and outcomes the prospect can achieve themselves through free content/education or free products/services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. Providing free resources brings people into your world, positioning you for future, larger engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>.

### State the Facts and Tell the Truth
The best long-term strategy is to "state the facts and tell the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:00">[48:35:00]</a>. This forces the business to *change reality* by doing epic things, rather than exaggerating an underwhelming story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[48:48:00]</a>.

#### Key Tactics:
*   **Show Only What You Can Show:** Highlight unique aspects of your business that competitors may also do but don't explicitly state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:00">[49:24:00]</a>. Slice the data of your business to find what makes it unique (e.g., "It's toasted" for cigarettes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:06:00">[50:06:00]</a>.
*   **Say What Only You Can Say:** Get narrower to be more unique. You don't need to be the best in the world, just the best in a specific "puddle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:27:00">[51:27:00]</a>. Being perceived as the best in a specific niche (like Rockefeller buying the biggest oil refinery to claim market dominance) can have massive strategic value for market consolidation and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a>.

## Measuring Progress
Masters of marketing have more ways to win, using a higher quality and quantity of metrics to measure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:42:00">[58:42:00]</a>. Beginners often only look at binary outcomes or lagging indicators (e.g., sales down, churn up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Masters identify and track leading indicators and milestones at each stage of the customer journey (e.g., list quality, call pick-up rates, hook performance, offer conversion, second call show-up rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. This allows for continuous improvement and a clearer understanding of "directional correctness" towards success, even if the ultimate outcome isn't immediately visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.

In the pursuit of growth, particularly for entrepreneurs, reliance on rigid routines and superstitions can become a significant constraint, acting as a "weak link in the chain" that prevents further advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. While routines are often lauded for their potential benefits, becoming overly dependent on them can actually weaken an individual and their capacity to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

## Crutches and Superstitions: A Source of Weakness

According to Alex Hormozi, founder of acquisition.com, which generates approximately $85 million annually in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, "crutches are dangerous" and "superstition is dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. When individuals become religiously adherent to [[Daily routine and productivity strategies | routines]] or specific rituals, they inadvertently make themselves weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This extends to using phrases like "I have to," "I must," "I should," or "I need to," which imply a lack of control over one's circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

Common examples of such dependencies include:
*   Needing alcohol, blunts, or edibles to fall asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   Requiring coffee in the morning to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   Relying on pharmaceutical drugs or specific rituals to achieve [[Balancing morning routines versus productivity | productivity]], creativity, alertness, or happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

Historically, humans lived and thrived without these modern crutches, demonstrating the innate ability to sleep and function without external aids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### The "Normal" Trap

Initially, a routine or substance might offer a benefit, such as coffee making one feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. However, over time, the body adapts, and the routine becomes necessary just to maintain a normal baseline, negating the initial benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. To continuously gain benefits from activities, one must [[Training routines and exercise variations | cycle]] them, which inherently means not having a fixed routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## All-or-Nothing Mentality as a Limiter

A character trait that correlates with dependency is the "all-or-nothing" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This mindset, where one either goes "full send" or does nothing, whether in social activities or [[Training routines and exercise variations | training routines and exercise variations]] like exercising or taking supplements, limits an individual's ability to engage in moderation or consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Such definitive beliefs, like "I am an all-or-nothing type person," can become deeply embedded and prevent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Resilience and Antifragility

True strength lies in being non-resilient to external disruptions. The speaker suggests that competitors should hope their rivals are dependent on "magical routines" so that any interruption to these routines will disable them for the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Rocky vs. Drago Analogy
The difference is likened to the contrast between Rocky and Drago in *Rocky IV*. Drago relies on "fancy science things" and supplements, while Rocky trains outdoors, demonstrating raw, adaptable strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The ideal is to be able to perform effectively regardless of circumstances, like sleeping on a cot and being just as effective as someone who requires every aspect of their life "completely dialed in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the [[Concept of antiroutine | concept of antiroutine]].

## Key Takeaways

Entrepreneurs aiming for significant growth must be aware of two critical areas:

### 1. The Power of "I Am" Statements
"I am" statements are incredibly powerful because they reflect deeply embedded beliefs about oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Identifying oneself with limiting traits, such as "I have a short fuse," "I am disorganized," or "I am not good with time/money," creates self-imposed weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. It's crucial to ask: "Does this belief serve me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. If not, one should stop saying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Instead, use phrases like "I have a tendency towards" or "I struggle with behaviors that are this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

### 2. Beware of Routines and Superstitions
Be "incredibly weary" of any [[Daily routine and productivity strategies | routines]], superstitions, or "religion" that you claim is the sole source of your [[Balancing morning routines versus productivity | productivity]], creativity, alertness, or well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. These dependencies, and the "threats or punishments" you impose on yourself if they are disrupted (e.g., "I'm agitated," "I can't focus"), are self-built weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

To build a large enterprise and make an impact, it's essential to understand who you are, adopt beliefs that serve you, and be able to succeed "independent of circumstance that you create" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. The goal is to be a source of action, not merely a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This concept underscores the [[Importance of avoiding complacency | importance of avoiding complacency]] and developing intrinsic strength.

From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The speaker, having achieved a net worth of over $100 million by age 31, shares insights gained from interactions with billionaires, focusing on themes that contribute significantly to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A core tenet of this success is the understanding and application of [[value_of_hard_work_and_persistence | hard work]] and the necessity of pushing through discomfort and [[pain_and_progress | pain]].

## The Foundation of Success: Skills, Focus, and Extreme Effort

Success is built on foundational choices:
*   **Rich people buy time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Ambitious people buy skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Generational wealth is transferred through education and skills, not just assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Lazy people buy distractions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. They avoid confronting their inadequacies, preferring "fluff videos" over reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

A common misconception is that more income streams lead to wealth; instead, they can merely spread you thin if you're actively working *in* each business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. True multiple income streams come from owning assets that generate income, which requires initial time and intense [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### The Power of Focus
[[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | Focus]] is measured by the number of things one says "no" to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most focused individuals say "yes" to only one thing and "no" to everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### The "100x Not 2x" Mindset
Successful individuals operate with a "100x not 2x" mentality, meaning they pursue extreme levels of effort rather than incremental gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This means making significant "trades" or sacrifices that others might not be willing to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For example, a CEO grew a company from $200 million to $1.2 billion in two years by attending 66 events in one quarter, sacrificing time with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> "People want your outcome their way. They want to have their cake and eat it too." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
> "They are trades, they're price tags." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

## Embracing the Discomfort of Hard Work

The speaker advocates for intense, sustained periods of [[work_ethic_and_entrepreneurship | work]]. He suggests the "12x30" challenge: working 12 hours a day for 30 straight days, including weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This experience reveals:
1.  You are not "made of glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
2.  How much more you can be working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
3.  How much faster you can achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
4.  How much you can improve daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
5.  You gain a "gear" for future intense periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
6.  Others are working harder and succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

This intense period yields more results in a month than many achieve in a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The speaker himself has worked 15-16 hour days consistently, sometimes for nine months straight, describing it as a "kind of tired a good night's sleep couldn't fix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This experience of pushing through extreme fatigue builds "supreme confidence" and a "trade of being relentless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Work as Volume Times Leverage
Work is defined as volume times leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Initially, high volume builds skill, which then increases leverage, leading to greater output over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. An example given is the speaker's own content creation, where increasing output tenfold also led to improved quality and even greater results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### The "Champion Wall"
The concept of the "champion wall" posits that true [[value_of_hard_work_and_persistence | work]] begins when motivation stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Most people stop when the excitement fades, but champions push past this point of discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

> "I hated every minute of training but I would tell myself suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion." – Muhammad Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>

The ability to "whip yourself back in" and continue working when tired or distracted is a muscle that takes practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This involves enduring discomfort for extended periods, similar to pushing through cravings during a diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### The Nature of Pain and Growth
[[pain_and_progress | Hardness]] and stress are inherent parts of life and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Stress from growth is preferable to stress from stagnation or decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. The speaker argues that the greatest stressor is believing that having problems is a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

There are only three outcomes in hard times: quit, it gets easier, or you get harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Only quitting leads to losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. What felt difficult five years ago often seems trivial in retrospect, not because the problems changed, but because you became better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

> "Hard is for now, not forever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>

The "hard times" of today become the "good old days" when viewed in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. [[pain_and_progress | Consistent growth]] is consistently painful, hence "growing pains," not "growing joys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

A metaphorical story illustrates this: to become courageous, one needs monsters to conquer; to become patient, one needs to work harder and longer; to become wise, one needs crushing failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. A good life is not an easy life, but one that shapes you into a good person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## Urgency, Proof, and Education

### Act with Urgency
Successful individuals act with urgency, minimizing the gap between thought and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. A simple hack is to ask: "Can I get this done by the end of today?" instead of "by the end of the week?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This increases progress pace by 7x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

### Proof Over Promises
Building a strong brand and trust comes from demonstrating what you've *done* (proof), not just what you *say* you can do (promises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Trust is a scarce commodity in a world where anyone can claim anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Overnight success is a misconception; it's the visible output of prolonged, hidden inputs and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

> "You don't get rich by flying on private jets, you get rich then you can fly on private jets." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>

### The Investment of Education
[[critique_of_hard_work_as_a_path_to_wealth | Education]] is an investment in oneself, and the cost of not being educated is far greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. The speaker has spent significant sums to acquire skills and relationships, viewing it as an investment in his own "asset" – himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. If an education costs $50,000 but teaches a million-dollar skill, not investing means losing $950,000 each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles and Mindsets

### The "Slower Than You Expect, Faster Than You Can Imagine" Phenomenon
Results in entrepreneurship often happen slower than expected and then faster than imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. This requires [[patience_in_achieving_success | patience]] and persistence through periods of minimal or negative returns before a sudden breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

### Mastering Progress
Masters in any field have more ways to win, meaning they can identify and measure smaller progress markers throughout a long project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. Beginners only see the output, becoming discouraged when immediate results aren't visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Increasing expertise involves increasing the number of measurable wins, which makes the work itself reinforcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Eliminating "Fairness" as a Distraction
One of the biggest distractions that keeps people poor is the belief that life should be fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. Eliminating the word "fairness" from one's vocabulary and focusing solely on what needs to be done removes a significant distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. Your starting point is beyond your control, but your rate of [[pain_and_progress | progress]] and [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | improvement]] is within your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

### Understanding Trade-Offs
Many people desire the benefits of certain traits (e.g., fame, discipline, ambition) but are unwilling to pay the price (e.g., privacy, pleasure, loneliness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>. Success requires recognizing and being willing to make these trades to the necessary extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

> "You can't wish for strong character and an easy life because the price of each is the other." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>

People often underestimate the required effort, believing their 10/10 effort for a small goal is sufficient for a much larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Outcomes often require meeting *all* conditions, like opening all valves in a pipeline, meaning effort in one area might not yield results until other necessary conditions are also met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

### Setting Your Own Standards
Mediocrity often stems from believing things "should" be easier or that one "deserves" success without the requisite effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. The highest level of achievement comes from setting one's own standards higher than anyone else's, even the market's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. This means continuous hammering and iterations, long before external approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

This mindset requires recognizing that achieving excellence in anything takes years of dedicated, hard [[the_role_of_failure_and_perseverance_in_achieving_success | work]] and focus, often limiting one to only a few truly exceptional pursuits in a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | Believing in shortcuts]] or that minimal effort will yield grand results "chains you to mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

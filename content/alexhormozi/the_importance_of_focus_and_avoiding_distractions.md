From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The pursuit of success, particularly in entrepreneurship, hinges significantly on the ability to [[the_importance_of_focus_and_saying_no | focus]] and eliminate distractions. Lazy people, according to the speaker, tend to acquire distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. True progress and the answers one seeks are not found in news feeds or through distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Instead, many individuals distract themselves to avoid confronting their own perceived inadequacies, preferring "fluff videos" over reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

An individual can be ambitious yet remain poor if they are perpetually distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Defining Focus

[[importance_of_focus_in_business | Focus]] is not an amorphous term; it is precisely measured by the quantity of things one declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Conversely, it can be gauged by how few things one agrees to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The most focused individual is someone who commits to only one thing and rejects all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Distraction

*   **Spreading Thin:** Early in his entrepreneurial journey, the speaker managed nine businesses, believing that "seven income streams make you wealthy." However, this approach only spread him thin across seven (or nine) different directions, requiring him to be the primary rainmaker for all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Genuine multiple income streams typically stem from owning assets that generate income, which initially requires [[importance_of_focus_and_specialization | time and focus]] to acquire the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Discomfort:** [[eliminating_distractions_for_selfimprovement | Distraction]] is the opposite of sticking with a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The ability to push through mental fatigue and discomfort—to "whip back in" and keep working—is a muscle that strengthens with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This means working to the point of fatigue and resisting the urge for immediate rest or distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This phenomenon is compared to dieting, where cravings for sweet things often pass within 20 minutes if one resists the urge to give in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **False Sense of Balance:** Any activity not essential for continuing one's primary focus is a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The concept of "balance" is often a misconception, particularly among less successful individuals, as it often justifies laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Urgency:** Successful individuals and entrepreneurs act with urgency, minimizing the gap between thought and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. A simple tactic is to ask if a task planned for the end of the week can be completed by the end of today, increasing progress by 7x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This applies to moving deadlines from monthly to weekly, weekly to daily, and daily to hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. A five-minute task should be done immediately if five minutes are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **The "It's Not Fair" Fallacy:** One of the most significant distractions is the belief that life or circumstances are unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. Eliminating the word "should" from one's vocabulary, which implies expectations of an uncaring universe, can remove this distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. This mindset hinders action and learning, as it focuses on uncontrollable starting points rather than controllable rates of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.
*   **Preference Excuses:** Many people fail because they make preference excuses, unwilling to pay the full "price" or make the necessary tradeoffs for their desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. For example:
    *   Privacy is the price of fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
    *   Loneliness is the price of ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
    *   Pleasure is the price of discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.
    *   Novelty is the price of loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
    *   Discretion is the price of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

    These are not binary ideals but exist on a spectrum, and most people underestimate the *degree* of sacrifice required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. They may believe they are giving 10 out of 10 effort for a goal, but in reality, their effort might only be 1 out of 10 for the actual scale of their aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

## Overcoming Distraction with Work Ethic

*   **Work Begins When Motivation Stops:** Initial excitement for a new idea fades, and the actual work begins when motivation wanes and worry or stress sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This is the "champion wall" where most people stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
*   **Doing the Unpleasant:** [[importance_of_focus_and_perseverance_in_entrepreneurship | Work ethic]] is truly tested when one is tired, distracted, or engaged in tasks that are not inherently pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. "Passion" does not sustain one through the hardest times; rather, it is the desire to bring a vision into reality, which can feel like painful labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **The "100x, Not 2x" Mentality:** Significant growth (e.g., 200 million to 1.2 billion in under two years) requires an absurd amount of effort, far beyond incremental increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The speaker, for instance, began creating 10 times more content volume than he previously did, and this consistent high volume improved his skill and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This intense work applies specifically to the domain one is pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Learning to Work:** The speaker's past self believed he worked hard, but he made little progress because he wasn't creating output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He advocates for a "12x30" challenge: working 12 hours a day for 30 straight days, including weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This exercise teaches resilience, speed, and reveals one's capacity for intense effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Working more helps one get better at working itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **The Power of Repetition:** Work is defined as volume times leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In the beginning, high volume leads to skill acquisition, which then increases leverage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Becoming good at anything takes time and repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. The sooner one starts, the sooner they achieve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Hard is For Now, Not Forever:** Difficult periods inevitably end. One either quits, the situation gets easier, or one becomes stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Hard times develop character and perspective; often, these are the "good old days" viewed in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Embracing Discomfort:** Growth is consistently accompanied by pain, known as "growing pains." Stress is an inherent part of life; the biggest problem is perceiving having problems or being stressed as a problem in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. A "good life" is not an easy life, but one that develops a good person, which is inherently hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Fulfillment Through Effort:** The speaker's personal thesis is that hard work is the goal, aiming to empty the tank every day. These are the days that lead to the most fulfillment, even if tiring in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. This means doing what is required, regardless of how one feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Don't Model the Plateau:** [[avoiding_distractions_and_shiny_object_syndrome | Overnight success]] is often a public perception of a "viral moment" that follows a long period of unseen inputs and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. People mistakenly try to copy what successful individuals do *after* they achieve success (e.g., flying private jets), rather than the hard work and behaviors that led to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **The Importance of Proof:** Building a brand or reputation requires proof of one's actions, not just promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. In a world of instant reach, trust is a scarce commodity, built by doing what one says they have done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Conditions for Success:** Outcomes only occur when all necessary conditions are met. If something doesn't work, it's not a failure of the method but an indication that a specific condition or "brick" in the "bridge" to success is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. One must identify and fulfill that missing condition rather than blaming external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[tactics_to_eliminate_distractions_and_focus | Distraction]] enables the lie that one can try a hundred things and find one that works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. In reality, any endeavor can succeed with enough iteration, but individuals often underestimate the required number of iterations and the intensity of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Success demands a constant resetting of expectations and a willingness to continually "bid" more effort until the desired outcome is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. It takes what it takes, and what it costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

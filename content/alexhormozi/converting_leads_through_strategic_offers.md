This article outlines a 10-step process for acquiring a business's first five customers, drawing insights from the upcoming book "100 Million Dollar Leads" by Alex Hormozi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The approach emphasizes a structured, personalized method to convert existing contacts into paying clients, starting with strategic free offers to build testimonials and experience. This strategy helps with [[lead_generation_and_conversion | lead generation and conversion]] by starting with a warm audience.

## The 10-Step Customer Acquisition Process

### Step 1: Compile Your Leads

The initial step in [[innovative_customer_acquisition_strategies | innovative customer acquisition strategies]] is to create a comprehensive list of potential contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **List 1: Email Contacts** Extract all contacts from your email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **List 2: Social Media Contacts** Gather all direct message-able followers across your social media profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **List 3: Phone Contacts** Export all contacts from your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Combining these lists will yield a significant number of potential leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Step 2: Select a Primary Platform

From your compiled lists, choose one platform where you have the largest number of contacts to begin your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This could be email, Instagram, or phone contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Step 3: Personalize Your Message

Craft a personalized message for each contact, referencing something you already know about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This could be a life event (e.g., new baby, job change, recent move) or a shared interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The goal is to show you've taken a few seconds to craft a genuine message, avoiding generic blasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Step 4: Initiate Outreach

Commit to reaching out to 100 people every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The initial effort may feel challenging, but consistency is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This proactive approach is part of effective [[methods_for_advertising_and_generating_business_leads | methods for advertising and generating business leads]].

### Step 5: Warm Up Engaged Leads (ACA Framework)

When a contact replies, "warm them up" using the ACA framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   **Acknowledge:** Acknowledge something personal about them (e.g., "Oh, so you have two kids?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Compliment:** Offer a sincere compliment related to their personal situation (e.g., "Wow, you must be a super mom working full-time and having two kids!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Ask:** Transition to a question that subtly relates to the service you offer, connecting it to the compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For a weight loss service, this might be, "Hey, so you're Superman, how do you have time to eat right and work out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This conversational approach avoids direct selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Step 6: Invite Referrals

Do not solicit your service directly to the contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Instead, ask if they know anyone who might benefit from your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>: "Do you know anyone who's looking for X, Y, and Z? Because I'm opening up a few slots to help people do exactly that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. You are asking for a favor, not a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. If they don't know anyone, a humorous follow-up could be, "Haha, does anyone you hate come to mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> This can help overcome [[challenges_in_lead_management_and_conversion | challenges in lead management and conversion]].

### Step 7: Make a Strategic (Free) Offer

If a contact expresses interest, they transition from a "lead" (someone you can contact) to an "engaged lead" (someone who has shown interest in your offering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. To convert them, offer your service for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This is a crucial step in [[how_to_create_compelling_offers | how to create compelling offers]]:
*   **Terms of Exchange:** Offer your service for free in exchange for three commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>:
    1.  They actually use your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    2.  They provide feedback on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    3.  They leave a "killer review" if they feel it deserves one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

    This free offer helps you gain experience, improve your service, and gather testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It's a form of [[utilizing_free_content_for_lead_generation | utilizing free content for lead generation]]. Even if it's monetarily free, customers are still exchanging their time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

    A direct pitch for this free offer could be:
    > "By the way, do you know anybody who is [describe their struggles] looking to [dream outcome] in [time delay]? I'm taking on five case studies for free because that's all I can handle. I just want to get some testimonials for my service or product. I just had a girl named XXX work with me to get [dream outcome] even though she described the same struggle [the person you're talking to] is struggling with. I'd like to get more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>

    A shorter version:
    > "I help [type of customer] get [dream outcome] in [time period] without effort and sacrifice, and I guarantee XYZ to decrease risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

    If people don't want to work with you even for free, ask them why to uncover and eliminate hidden costs associated with your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Step 8: Reiterate Outreach

Once you have your first free customers, return to your large contact list and continue the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Some contacts from whom you asked for referrals will provide free leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Step 9: Gradually Introduce Pricing

Once people start referring clients to you, you know your service is valuable enough to start charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Phased Pricing:** Gradually increase your price by changing the "free" offer to a discounted one for batches of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   Next five: 80% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>
    *   Next five: 60% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>
    *   Next five: 40% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   Next five: 20% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
    *   Then, full price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>

    Your value should increase as you gain experience and incorporate feedback, allowing you to eventually charge above full retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This continuous improvement helps with [[optimizing_conversion_rates_for_service_businesses | optimizing conversion rates for service businesses]].

*   **Handling Free Clients at Capacity:** When you reach capacity with paying customers, you can ethically ask your free clients to start paying if they wish to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. If they decline, gracefully accept, and request the promised review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Free clients are invaluable for reviews, referrals, and potential future conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Step 10: Maintain Lead Nurturing

Continue to engage with your large list of contacts by checking in regularly and providing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This consistent goodwill will eventually lead to contacts soliciting you for your services, driven by your testimonials and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This ongoing engagement is a key part of [[leveraging_content_and_outreach_to_increase_business_profitability | leveraging content and outreach to increase business profitability]] and effective [[strategies_for_gaining_leads_across_industries | strategies for gaining leads across industries]].

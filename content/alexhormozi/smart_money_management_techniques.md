Effective [[personal_finance_strategies | personal finance strategies]] often involve avoiding common pitfalls, especially in one's twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Adopting [[personal_finance_habits_and_strategies | smart money habits]] early can prevent long-term financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Prioritize Learning and Earning Capacity

One significant mistake is underspending on education while overspending on status symbols like expensive phones, cars, or watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Instead, focus on investing money into your ability to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

It is crucial to take jobs primarily to learn rather than just to earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The extra earning potential of $10,000 or $25,000 annually in your twenties is minor over the long term compared to the value of acquiring skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. [[financial_mindset_of_wealthy_individuals | Wealthy individuals]] prioritize long-term growth over immediate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Strategic Investment in Yourself

Rather than simply "saving" money, it is more effective to invest it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. For those aiming to become "filthy rich," the primary investment should be in oneself and one's earning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. While dollar-cost averaging into an S&P 500 fund is a good long-term strategy, the focus in your twenties should be on increasing your earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Doubling or tripling your earning capacity by investing $10,000 now will yield far greater returns than traditional savings, especially when accounting for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Investment Prioritization
Prioritize how much you will invest before spending any money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Allocate money for your learning and education first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This means setting aside funds into a separate account for learning opportunities and deploying that capital when the right opportunity arises, rather than investing only what's left at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Automate and Manualize
Automate investments into yourself to make it easy, and manualize spending on non-essential items to make it harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Using cash instead of credit cards for purchases can create a psychological "pain" that discourages unnecessary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Implement a system of separate accounts for different expenses (e.g., rent, personal investing, food, car) to control where your money goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Prudent Spending Habits

*   **Avoid Aimless Shopping:** Do not go shopping without a specific agenda or list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Stick to a pre-approved budget and only buy what is on your list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This simple habit can provide lifelong dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Time vs. Money on Food:** Once you earn more than $15 an hour, it may be more financially sensible to buy takeout food and save the time you would have spent on meal preparation, cooking, and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This reallocates your time towards higher-earning activities, effectively [[investment_strategies_for_small_capital | investing in yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Social Environment and Micro-Community

Living with the right people is crucial for financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Avoid roommates who are irresponsible or who do not share your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It is important to live with people who encourage you and are pursuing similar aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. In your twenties, living with multiple people can also be significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Your micro-community matters significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Overpay for convenience, such as living close to highways, gyms, and affordable food options, as this saves time and ancillary costs like gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Living with more people in a better, more convenient area is preferable to living with fewer people in a less desirable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Measuring Money and Modeling Success

Measure money in terms of how long it took you to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, a $100 shirt for someone earning $20 an hour (after taxes) might equate to 6 hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This perspective helps in understanding the true cost of purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

It is vital to model the correct "season of life" when looking at successful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Instead of imitating their current lifestyle, model what they did to achieve their success in their earlier, learning phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Developing Financial Discipline

Become competitive with how much money you are saving and investing in yourself, rather than focusing on how much you are making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Set personal records for the amount you put into your investment account each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This aligns with [[importance_of_financial_discipline_and_longterm_planning | long-term planning]].

### Daily Financial Check-Ins
Check your bank account every single morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While it might be uncomfortable initially, confronting financial reality is necessary to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This habit helps you understand your spending patterns and gain a "pulse" on your money, similar to how daily weigh-ins can help with weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. [[tracking_finances_daily_to_improve_money_habits | Tracking finances daily to improve money habits]] is a cornerstone of sound financial management.

## Balancing Experiences and Goals

While the focus should be on [[strategies_for_becoming_a_millionaire | becoming a millionaire]] through investment in self, it is acceptable to spend on one-time experiences that are unique to your twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These are experiences you may not be able to have later in life, such as backpacking through Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This aligns with [[balancing_life_priorities_and_financial_goals | balancing life priorities and financial goals]]. Give yourself permission to spend on these in a limited fashion, without draining your investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

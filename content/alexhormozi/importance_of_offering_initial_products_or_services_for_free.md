Starting a new business or launching a new product often involves making crucial decisions about pricing. A key piece of marketing advice emphasizes the strategy of beginning with low prices, or even offering services for free, to gain initial momentum and build a foundation for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach allows businesses to gradually increase prices over time, as it is "very difficult to come down" once high prices are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Why Start with Free or Low Prices?

The primary objective in the early stages of a business is to "get flow through the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Even for established businesses launching a new product or division, offering free services makes significant sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This strategy offers several [[benefits_of_offering_free_services_initially | key advantages]]:

*   **Customer Conversion** Free customers often become paying customers after an initial period, provided a good job is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Referrals** Satisfied free customers are likely to refer others, especially if the free offer was contingent on referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Testimonials and Reviews** Offering free services is an excellent way to gather valuable testimonials and reviews, which can then be used to attract more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Feedback for Improvement** Free engagements provide critical feedback, allowing businesses to refine their product or service and "make this better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This iterative process helps improve the offering much faster with more people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Proof and Reputation** Starting with free or low-cost options helps gather "enough proof" before attempting to sell at full price, preventing damage to a new business's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It acknowledges that new products or services are often not perfect initially, offering "a little bit of Grace" from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Building [[building_an_initial_customer_list | Initial Customer List]] and Momentum** It's the easiest way to get going with any new product and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This aligns with the principle to "create flow, monetize flow, then add friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, emphasizing the need to get people interacting with the system first.

## Real-World Examples

The speaker provides several personal examples of this strategy:

*   **Online Personal Training Business**
    When starting his first online personal training business over 13 years ago, the speaker was hesitant to charge money directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Instead, he asked clients to donate $500 or $1,000 to a charity of their choice in exchange for 12 weeks of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach secured his first 13 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and allowed him to transition them to paying customers who also provided referrals after the initial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Gym Launch**
    With his second business, Gym Launch, he offered gym turnarounds for free, only making money if he generated sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He even fronted the cash for marketing, travel, and accommodation, eliminating all risk for the gym owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This strategy allowed him to quickly gain "way more yeses" and test the system in over 30 markets, eventually leading to licensing the system to over 5,000 locations and selling the company for $46.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Software Company (Allen)**
    Even when starting his software company, Allen, the focus was on acquiring case studies, testimonials, and success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The initial offering involved free customers to build a strong foundation of social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Tactical Implementation for [[transition_from_free_to_paid_services | Transitioning from Free to Paid]]

When starting with free or heavily discounted services, it's essential to communicate future pricing expectations upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Initial clients should understand they are receiving a special deal in exchange for feedback and public testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This ensures valuable insights and marketing assets are secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Gradual Price Increases
Once a sufficient number of test cases (e.g., 10-20 people) have been accumulated, a systematic approach to increasing prices is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The speaker suggests increasing prices by 20% for every subsequent batch of five customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This gradual increase continues until the "conversion rate times the price goes down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, indicating the sweet spot for maximizing sales at the highest possible price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Setting Expectations
It's crucial to tell early adopters, "Hey, I plan on going to this price point, but I'm willing to do it for free in exchange for X," with 'X' typically being feedback and a public testimonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This transparency secures the necessary feedback and allows for leverageable testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Connecting to Key Marketing Principles

The strategy of starting with free or low-cost services is deeply intertwined with broader marketing truths:

*   **[[utilizing_free_content_for_lead_generation | Lead Generation]] and Flow** Especially for [[acquiring_customers_for_small_businesses | small businesses]], the fundamental need is often "more leads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Offering free content or services creates this "flow through the system," allowing businesses to learn and improve their offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   **[[the_importance_of_providing_value | Providing Value]] and Giving Away Secrets** The concept of [[giving_away_free_content_as_a_strategy_for_online_course_success | giving away the secrets and selling the implementation]] is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Businesses should strive to "make your free stuff better than their paid stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. This builds reputation and increases the likelihood of conversion, as free offerings act as a "complete solution to a very narrow problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Customer Value (LTV) to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
    While the initial focus is on getting customers, understanding the LTV to CAC ratio is critical for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. By providing exceptional value and collecting feedback from early free users, businesses can improve their product and processes, leading to higher LTV. This higher LTV then allows a business to profitably spend more on customer acquisition in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

By embracing the strategy of offering initial products or services for free, businesses can effectively [[overcoming_initial_setbacks_in_entrepreneurship | overcome initial setbacks]], gather crucial data, build a strong reputation, and lay the groundwork for profitable scaling.

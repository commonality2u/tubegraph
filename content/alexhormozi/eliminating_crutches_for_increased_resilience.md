Entrepreneurial growth is often bottlenecked by constraints, particularly those related to an individual's character traits and beliefs, rather than just their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Overcoming these internal limitations, which act as "crutches" or "superstitions," is crucial for building resilience and achieving sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Identifying Limiting Character Traits

A common impediment to growth is the adoption of "I am" statements, which are powerful declarations of deeply embedded beliefs about oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. These statements can become self-fulfilling prophecies that limit potential.

Examples of self-limiting "I am" statements include:
*   "We are high anxiety people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>
*   "I'm an all or nothing type person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
*   "I am bad at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>
*   "I have a short fuse" or "I have a temper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>
*   "I am disorganized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>
*   "I am not good with time" or "I am not good with money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>

The critical question to ask about such statements is: "Does this belief serve me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> If a declared trait does not support an individual's goals, it should be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Instead of "I am," it is more empowering to say "I have a tendency towards" or "I struggle with behaviors that are this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. The identity must evolve to whatever is required for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## [[the_dangers_of_dependency_on_routines | The Dangers of Crutches and Superstitions]]

Crutches and superstitions refer to [[the_dangers_of_dependency_on_routines | routines]] or dependencies that, when relied upon, make an individual weaker rather than stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. These dependencies can be exploited by competitors, as they render an individual non-resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

Common examples of crutches include reliance on substances or rituals for basic functions:
*   Alcohol to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>
*   Blunts, edibles, or pills to fall asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>
*   Coffee just to feel "normal" after prolonged use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>
*   Specific rituals or environments deemed necessary for productivity, creativity, or well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>

These dependencies lead to a self-imposed weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. The belief that one "must," "should," or "needs to" follow a specific routine or use a particular substance indicates a lack of control over one's own state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

### Building Resilience

To foster resilience and independence from circumstance, it's essential to:
*   **Cycle Activities:** Instead of rigid routines, cycle activities to gain temporary benefits from novelty, preventing dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Be Flexible:** Aim to be effective regardless of environment or external conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This is likened to the difference between Rocky Balboa's rugged training and Drago's hyper-reliant scientific methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Stop Self-Imposed Punishments:** Avoid threats or punishments spoken over oneself (e.g., "I can't be productive" if a routine is broken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. These are weaknesses built into the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals should strive to be the source of their own effectiveness, not a reaction to external circumstances or dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

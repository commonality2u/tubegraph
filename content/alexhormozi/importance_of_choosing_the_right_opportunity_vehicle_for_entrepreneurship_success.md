Achieving significant entrepreneurial success, particularly reaching annual sales of $10 million or more, is rare. Only one in every 250 businesses achieves this milestone, meaning 99% of entrepreneurs never do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similarly, 90% of businesses never hit $1 million a year in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, [[strategies_for_entrepreneurial_success | success leaves clues]], and it can be broken down into two main categories: the entrepreneur themselves and the opportunity vehicle they pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. When a highly skilled entrepreneur is combined with an optimal opportunity, it creates a path to a $10 million-plus business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## The Entrepreneur: Skills and Beliefs

An entrepreneur's potential is primarily determined by their skills and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. While character traits were once considered a separate category, they are, in fact, collections of smaller, trainable skills. For instance, "patience" is a general term for many little skills that can be learned and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. "Soft skills," though harder to measure, are also 100% trainable and often crucial for gaining influence within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Beyond skills, an entrepreneur's beliefs play a critical role. Limiting beliefs can drastically decrease potential and are often invisible because they form one's core lens through which they view the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. These "unknown unknowns"—things one doesn't even question as possible—are often the most powerful limitations to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

> "We question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never think to question." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>

An example is an entrepreneur who was a high-level CrossFit competitor but wouldn't market his fitness app because he believed he didn't deserve to if he wasn't the "winner." Once convinced to make a single post, his revenue skyrocketed from $20,000 to $100,000 per month, simply by changing this limiting belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Unchaining an entrepreneur often involves identifying and addressing the reasons they give for why they "can't" do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## The Opportunity Vehicle: Leverage

Leverage is defined as the difference between what you put in and what you get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The right opportunity vehicle can significantly amplify an entrepreneur's efforts. The speaker personally experienced this transition:
*   Starting with local gyms (brick and mortar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   Scaling to a done-for-you gym turnaround business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   Transitioning to a licensing model, which created "all margin" revenue and led to rocket-like growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Each of these steps represented a higher leverage opportunity, unlocking immense value from the same core skills (marketing, sales, profit optimization, workout and meal plan creation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs fail to reach higher tiers because they remain in the wrong vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

As Archimedes said, "Give me a long enough lever and I can move the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Leverage means getting more for your inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

### Four Types of Leverage
Inspired by Naval Ravikant, the speaker renames the four types of leverage:
1.  **Collaboration:** Other people working for you. This could involve managing a sales team, where your effort in recruiting a sales recruiter amplifies the output of many salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Capital:** Other people's money invested on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Raising capital means you earn a percentage of gains without doing all the work to generate the initial capital yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Code:** Building software once that can be used by millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
4.  **Content:** Creating a piece of content once that can be consumed by millions, like a podcast episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

It is possible to "max out" on just one or two types of leverage to achieve significant success. For example, a private equity professional might focus solely on capital, or a movement leader on collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. However, combining them, like Facebook does with code, content, capital, and collaboration, can lead to massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

### Personal Journey Through Leverage Tiers
The speaker's career trajectory demonstrates increasing leverage:
*   **Employee:** Four figures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed:** Gained control over his time, leading to five figures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.
*   **Employing Others (Collaboration):** First level of leverage, reaching six figures per month (e.g., owning multiple gyms or running the gym turnaround business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.
*   **Licensing (Content):** Created content once that many people could access, leading to seven figures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisition.com (Capital, Collaboration, Content):** Buying into companies with existing teams, using content to attract businesses, and leveraging capital, leading to eight figures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

This progression shows that people who move faster in life don't necessarily move "faster" in terms of frenetic activity, but rather they get more out of every input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.

## Strategic Vehicle Selection and Persistence

While switching to a higher leverage vehicle can accelerate growth, it's crucial to acknowledge that each switch "starts at zero again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. The pace of the new vehicle must disproportionately outweigh the benefits of continued growth in the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

> "It's not about how hard you row, it's about what boat you're in." - Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>

This quote highlights the importance of market and industry selection. Warren Buffett's friend, who was smarter and harder working, did "okay" in the steel business while Buffett became vastly wealthier in investing, simply because investing was a vehicle with fewer headwinds and more growth potential at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

However, sometimes staying in the same vehicle for an extended period, even if it's not the "highest leverage," can lead to massive success due to sheer persistence. The owner of Panda Express, for example, built a multi-billion dollar business over 45 years by sticking to one vehicle (brick and mortar food service) and mastering collaboration and capital, even without using content or code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. His longevity in the game allowed him to "unlock multipliers on the leverage" he already had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

### The Cost of Ignorance: Investing in Skills
Not knowing how to earn more is an "ignorance debt" that costs a person significantly each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>. Investing in skills and education is the fastest way to pay down this debt because skills provide an ongoing, compounding return that cannot be taken away or taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. For example, a $1,000 investment in a sales training course could increase annual income from $40,000 to $220,000, yielding an additional $180,000 *every year*, far outperforming a 10% return in the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Transitioning to Entrepreneurship

For individuals looking to become entrepreneurs, the path involves a shift from earning to learning, often by leveraging current employment to acquire skills:

1.  **Get Paid to Learn:** Seek jobs where you can gain valuable skills. Communicate your desire to learn new skills to potential employers; good business owners will support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Live Below Your Means:** Reduce personal expenses to stack cash. This minimizes personal financial risk, allowing you to take greater calculated risks in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Start a Side Hustle:** Use accumulated cash to fund a side hustle. The goal is for it to eventually become your main hustle, not just supplemental income. This tests the viability of your new vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:00">[45:14:00]</a>.
4.  **Match and Sustain Income:** Continue the side hustle until it consistently matches your current employment income for at least six months. This ensures stability and proves the model isn't based on a single good month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>.
5.  **Cut Bait:** Once sustained, leave your job and fully commit to the new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>.

It's vital to embrace humility during this transition. The speaker himself moved from a high-paying management consulting job to a $14/hour personal trainer role to acquire foundational sales and marketing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.

## The Infinite Game of Business

Entrepreneurship is an "infinite game," meaning there are known and unknown players, no agreed-upon rules, and the sole purpose is to keep playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>. Approaching business with a "finite frame" (e.g., trying to "win" or "finish first" by a specific metric) leads to failure because other players will always be willing to play longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>.

The goal is to find games you don't want to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:00">[52:04:00]</a>. It's common for entrepreneurs to shift industries or roles within an industry. Many people quit an industry when they simply dislike a specific function within a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>. Staying within an industry but switching roles can lead to more reps and better performance. In a micro-business, an entrepreneur gets to "taste all the roles" to discover what they enjoy most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:52:00">[53:52:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to play the game of business for the long haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:00">[51:48:00]</a>. [[importance_of_focus_and_perseverance_in_entrepreneurship | Persistence and continuous learning]] (the "metascale" game) mean you win by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>. Your baseline skill set continuously grows, leading to higher minimum income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[55:10:00]</a>.

To begin this journey and move past the million-dollar income category, the most foundational skill to acquire is sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. Without sales, no business can make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.

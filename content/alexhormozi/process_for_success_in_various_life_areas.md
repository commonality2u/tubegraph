Achieving success is a multifaceted process that applies to various aspects of life, including health, relationships, business, investing, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The ultimate goal is to impress "future you," not others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article outlines a systematic approach to [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | winning]] by focusing on actionable steps.

## What to Do: The Inversion Principle

To understand what to do, it's often easier to first identify what *not* to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This concept, known as "inversion" and attributed to Albert Einstein and Charlie Munger, suggests that when facing a tough problem, one should always invert it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Our brains are naturally better at finding problems (threats) than solutions, as we are programmed to survive, not thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Activity: Imagining Your Least Successful Self
Consider the least successful version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. What does that person do or not do to guarantee they won't win? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> Examples include:
*   Being impatient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Showing up late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   Being unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   Being unconfident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Being transactional rather than relational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   Not following up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Not advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   Not asking for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

This list highlights actions that guarantee failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The shorter the list, the more potent the identified behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Inverting for Success
Once you have this list of "what not to do," simply invert it to discover "what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   Impatient → Patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   Showing up late → Always being on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Unprepared → Always prepared or overprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   Not confident → Confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   Transactional → Relational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   Doesn't follow up → Always follows up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
*   Doesn't advertise → Advertises constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   Not asking for referrals → Always doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

Many people already know how to win because they know how to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## How to Do It: Breaking Down Commands and Building Skills

Often, people don't do what they know they should because they haven't broken down the actions to their most basic form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The more skilled a person is, the more general a command they can follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. For less skilled individuals or those learning, instructions must be highly detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Results come down to the number of skills a person has and the number of skills required to understand and execute a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. If there's one broken link in the chain of commands, the task will not be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. To ensure success, break down tasks to a level where failure is impossible because every step is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Operationalizing Traits
Consider a trait like "charismatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. To "be more charismatic," operationalize it into observable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>:
*   Smile when people walk in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   Change emphasis and tonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>
*   Remember people's names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   Ask people about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
*   Nod multiple times and respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Keep eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   Address everyone in the room upon entering and exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

This is the essence of good teaching and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If something can be learned, it is a skill, and it can be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Traits are simply buckets of smaller, teachable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Defining Learning, Intelligence, and Confidence
This approach helps in [[approach_to_successful_learning_and_competence_levels | understanding learning and competence levels]]:

*   **Learning**: Occurs when, presented with the same condition, you exhibit a new behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. If your behavior doesn't change, you haven't learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Intelligence**: The rate at which you change what you do in the same situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Faster change equals higher intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Confidence**: The percentage likelihood that something happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Confidence is domain-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. It increases with proof, which comes from doing something many times, especially in the exact situation it's needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. [[confidence_through_repetition | Confidence]] comes from the past, not the present; prepare *before* you need the skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Why You Should Do It: External and Internal Conditions

### External Conditions: Overcoming Opportunity Hopping
Many individuals experience the "five stages of opportunity hopping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>:
1.  **Uninformed Optimism**: "This seems easy, I can do that too." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>
2.  **Informed Pessimism**: "This is not as easy as I thought." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>
3.  **Valley of Despair**: Questioning passion and justifying reasons to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Most people jump ship here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
4.  **Informed Optimism**: Understanding the process, breaking it down into actionable steps, and measuring progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
5.  **Win**: Achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

Sticking with endeavors longer yields compounding returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | Wealth]] and mastery are often made during hard times because the market transfers to the few who remain standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>; [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | difficult times]] are opportunities to sharpen skills and prove your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. What makes you extraordinary is not *what* you do, but *how long* you are willing to do it for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

### Internal Conditions: Harnessing Motivation and Comparison
Motivation stems from deprivation—the perception of a gap between your current state and your desired state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Unlike physiological needs, money deprivation is psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. You only feel poor if you perceive a large gap between where you are and where you want to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

Your environment sets your standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. To feel more motivated, [[foundational_personal_development_for_success | change who you compare yourself to]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Rich people often feel more deprived of money because they compare themselves to even richer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. The most effective comparison is to the person you genuinely want to become; this creates the necessary gap for motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## Who You Need to Become: Action Over Identity

The idea of "Be-Do-Have" is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. When describing someone, we describe *how they behave* and *what they do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Being and identities become descriptions of actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. As Aristotle stated, "We are what we repeatedly do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

If you want to be a certain type of person, you need to do what that type of person does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. By doing, you *become*, and by doing, you *get* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. This means the person you want to become is simply a collection of actions you take, which is 100% under your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. "The work works on you more than you work on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. A new identity brings new [[setting_priorities_for_success | priorities]] and shifts in resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## When to Start: Now

There are common reasons people delay starting:
*   **Being Busy**: If you want behavioral change to last, the best time to start is when you are busiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. This forces you to learn how to make it work in the worst conditions, ensuring it sticks when times are easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Everyone has the same 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. If you're busy but not making progress, you're doing the wrong stuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. First, eliminate ineffective activities before adding new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. "You can be smart and busy but won't be broke. You can be busy and broke, but you're not smart. You can be smart and broke, but you're not busy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   **The "When, Then" Fallacy**: Delaying action until ideal conditions arise (e.g., "when I have more time, I'll do it") is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. You do the work now to get the thing later; you don't get in order to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

The answer to "when to start" is simple: the moment you want to be the future version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. If identity is based on action, then by starting to do what future you does, you *are* that person, and the proof will show up over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

To [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | win]], first identify what guarantees failure, then invert those actions to create a list of what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. Break down these actions into small, operationalized steps that anyone can follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. Understand that sticking with things, especially during hard times, yields outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. Cultivate motivation by comparing yourself to your desired future self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Recognize that becoming the person you want to be is about *doing* the actions that person would take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. Start now, especially when busy, and avoid the "when, then" fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

[[role_of_patience_and_action_in_success | Patience]] is key; everything must be hard before it can be easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. What makes things hard is not complexity, but consistent action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. Hard times provide opportunities to prove to yourself that even challenges cannot stop you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. The greatest games in life, like marriage, health, and business, are not about winning a single victory but about outlasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. Success boils down to making a decision you can 100% control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

If you do not change your behavior, you have not learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. Take the list of actions you know you should do, and commit to *doing* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. When you return to the same conditions, change your behavior to demonstrate what you've learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

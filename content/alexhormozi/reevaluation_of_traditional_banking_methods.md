The economic shifts experienced in 2022 have necessitated a change in investment strategies, particularly concerning how cash is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A significant personal shift involved removing all cash from traditional [[bank_loans_and_government_bonds | banks]] and placing it into an alternative that offers both increased safety and higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This adjustment reflects a broader need to reevaluate how money is held in response to the changing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Understanding Traditional Banking Mechanics

Many believe their cash is simply "sitting" in a bank account, but the reality is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. When you deposit cash into a [[bank_loans_and_government_bonds | bank]], you are effectively extending a loan to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This makes you a creditor of the bank, meaning if the bank fails, they owe you money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Banks primarily engage in two activities with deposited money:
*   **Purchasing Government Bonds** Banks often lend money to the government by buying bonds, which is considered a very low-risk investment because the government has the ability to print money to repay its debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Issuing Loans** They also loan money out for mortgages and other purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

In return for your "loan," banks typically pay a minimal annual interest rate, ranging from 0.1% to 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, when banks lend this money to the government, they might earn around 4% annually, effectively making 40 times more than what they pay to their depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Risks of Bank Deposits

Two crucial factors in lending money are the interest rate and the likelihood of repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. While interest rates are typically low for depositors, the risk aspect is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If a bank goes bankrupt, you risk losing all your money beyond the FDIC-insured amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Concerns have been raised about the solvency of the FDIC itself, and any amount exceeding the insurance limit would leave the depositor stuck as a creditor of a bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## An Alternative: US Treasuries

An alternative to traditional bank accounts that offers lower risk and potentially higher returns is investing in U.S. Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Initially dismissed due to perceived boredom, Treasuries are seen not just as an investment vehicle but as a superior form of bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Comparing U.S. Treasuries to commercial banks:
*   **Safety** The U.S. government is considered less likely to fail than a large bank like Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Returns** The U.S. government pays more interest than traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Leverage** It's possible to take loans against Treasuries for up to 80% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This means if you have $100,000 in Treasuries earning $4,000 annually, you could take an $80,000 loan while continuing to earn interest on the full $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This strategy exemplifies [[smart_money_management_techniques | smart money management techniques]] and [[philosophy_on_debt_and_financial_risk_management | financial risk management]].

Banks do not promote this alternative because their business model relies on taking depositors' money at a low interest rate and investing it to earn a much higher return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Broader Investment Strategy Shift

The speaker's [[personal_finance_strategies | personal finance strategies]] have evolved over time:
1.  **Investing in oneself:** Initial investments focused on learning skills, gaining access to mentors, coaching, and workshops, yielding the highest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  **S&P 500:** Once personal reinvestment capacity was exceeded, funds were channeled into the S&P 500, following advice from figures like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
3.  **Barbell Strategy:** After selling multiple companies, a barbell strategy was adopted, heavily weighting investments in stocks and real estate with minimal in-between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

A pivotal realization came from observing Dave Ramsey's advice to Graham Stephan: investment distribution should reflect one's knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. If 80-85% of one's financial knowledge is in real estate, then an 80-85% allocation to real estate is a "perfect distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Billionaires, according to Ramsey, tend to focus on a few areas they understand deeply and invest heavily in those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

This led to the understanding that investments should align with one's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. For the speaker, this expertise lies in service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The core principle is that an investment is only risky if you don't understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Outsized returns are achieved by leveraging an "unfair advantage" â€“ knowing more than others in a specific field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The revised investment strategy now mirrors the speaker's business strategy:
1.  **Invest in yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
2.  **Invest excess capital into broad market indexes.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
3.  **Once proficient in your primary domain, deploy capital into private deals within that domain.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

This approach emphasizes singular focus on what you know, doing it better, and consistently applying that knowledge over time to achieve substantial financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

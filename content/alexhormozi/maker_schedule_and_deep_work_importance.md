Productivity is defined as the amount of money gained for the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant increase in net worth from $0 at 23 to over $100 million at 31 was attributed to better time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The best investors of time are those who earn the most money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

There are two primary types of schedules entrepreneurs utilize: the manager schedule and the maker schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Individuals may switch between these "hats" throughout their day or week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Manager Schedule

The [[the_manager_schedule_and_time_optimization | manager schedule]] is the most common time investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Manager Schedule
Managers divide their time into the smallest possible chunks, often having 20+ segments per day ranging from 5 to 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For managers, an empty time slot is a lost opportunity, representing time that didn't yield a return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. They treat time like currency, with the primary cost being the coordination of calendars to find mutually empty slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. When managers interact and fill a slot, both parties often become more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Managers engage in various tasks, including collecting and reporting data, persuading, leading, training, encouraging, and making decisions one-on-one or in groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Their day typically begins with meeting preparation (30-60 minutes before) and ends with their last meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The duration of their day is directly proportional to the duration of their meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The main objective for a manager is to use up all their chunks in the day to maximize their time; a fully booked day signifies a maximally invested and productive manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Maker Schedule and Deep Work

The maker schedule is less known but crucial for creators and entrepreneurs who build substantial things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This schedule is where individuals achieve the highest returns on their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Maker Schedule
A significant portion of an entrepreneur's time should be dedicated to "making stuff" â€“ this is considered [[understanding_productivity_through_time_investment | deep work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. These are tasks that are often not urgent but are incredibly important for moving the business forward in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Examples include coding software, editing videos, or writing books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Unlike managers, makers operate with a few large chunks of time rather than many small slivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. An interruption or meeting within a large block (e.g., 4 hours) can prevent a maker from returning to their work and flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The "Zernick effect" describes how unfinished tasks or "open loops" (like impending meetings) consume brainpower and sap a maker's ability to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

For makers, the output of their time is the physical "stuff" or "things" they build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. They work *off* meetings, focusing on projects that cannot be completed in 30-minute intervals and may span weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Makers often have a set start time but variable end times, working "open to goal" and staying in flow as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This means a maker typically has one to three large chunks of time per day, often a morning and a post-lunch block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

For a maker, an *empty* time slot is not a lost opportunity; it *is* the opportunity to achieve significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. A maximally productive day for a maker is characterized by an empty calendar, which fills them with energy and allows them to tackle large projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The speaker's own book-writing period consisted of daily "maker time" with no meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## The Problem: Manager-Maker Interaction

The significant issue arises when managers interact with makers, as their diametrically opposed calendar philosophies lead to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Managers often assume makers can work on demand, perceiving an empty calendar as a lack of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

A short meeting for a manager costs one work unit (e.g., 15 minutes) out of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. However, for a maker, the same meeting can consume one of their two main daily time slots, potentially destroying half their day's productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. If a maker is falling behind, a manager's solution might be to interrupt them more, creating a vicious cycle where check-ins prevent actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

When managers don't understand how makers work, they kill their team's productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Both parties lose: the manager doesn't get the desired output, and the maker fails to achieve significant work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Makers face a dilemma:
1.  **Offend the manager:** Decline the meeting, risking damaged relationships and future collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
2.  **Destroy half their day:** Accept the meeting, often with no clear agenda or yield, and lose valuable maker time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This also applies to networking invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Being "ruthless" with time is crucial for achieving goals and making valuable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. All significant accomplishments typically occur during maker time, not manager time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

[[balacing_maker_and_manager_time_for_entrepreneurs | Balancing manager and maker time]] is essential. For instance, a COO might have more manager days (e.g., four manager days and one maker day), while a CEO might have the inverse (e.g., four maker days and one manager day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Both styles are necessary for organizational leverage and high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The key is to understand which style is best for a particular moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Solutions for Time Allocation

A three-pronged approach is necessary to address this challenge, involving managers, makers, and the organization as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### For Managers
1.  **Understand the costs imposed on makers:** This includes the cost of coordinating a meeting (disrupting current work) and the cost of the meeting itself (eating an entire work block) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. A meeting costs a maker about 10 times more in terms of lost work units than it costs a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Managers should ensure ad-hoc meetings are truly worth it and consider if issues can wait for a scheduled communication cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
2.  **Understand the value of a "maker's no":** If a maker declines a meeting, managers should not take offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Instead, see it as the maker prioritizing their commitment to the company and important work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Only frame a meeting as essential if it genuinely requires the maker's specific insight, giving them time to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
3.  **Ask your team for their ideal day:** Managers should inquire what a maximally productive day looks like for their team members and follow those recommendations as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. For example, some teams might prefer to batch all meetings into specific time slots, leaving the rest of their calendars empty for deep work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This also helps managers reduce their own meetings with makers, freeing them for other managerial tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
4.  **Realize that not all work needs to be synchronous:** Many tasks do not require simultaneous work from everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

### For Makers
1.  **Communicate how you work:** Inform managers about your work style, potentially sharing content that explains the maker-manager dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
2.  **Switch to a manager schedule when forced:** If a meeting interrupts a maker block, switch that entire block to a manager schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Use that time to knock out as many other ad-hoc meetings as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. The goal is to optimize the productivity system for that period, not identify solely as one or the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
3.  **Have standard meeting times:** Designate specific days or afternoons (e.g., Monday and Thursday afternoons) for accepting meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Push non-urgent meetings to these blocks to maximize remaining time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Leave some empty slots within these designated times for inevitable ad-hoc meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
4.  **Prioritize maker time, especially early on:** In the initial stages, makers might need to dedicate nights, weekends, and early mornings to their deep work, as their time may not yet be highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This dedicated time is essential for building foundational assets and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
5.  **Plan your day back-to-front:** When scheduling meetings, book them from the end of the day backwards (e.g., 5 PM, then 4 PM, then 3:30 PM) to keep the beginning of the day as open as possible for maker time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This minimizes small, unproductive gaps between meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
6.  **Communicate slow response times:** Inform people when you will be slow to respond, particularly during your maker blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. People adapt when expectations are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
7.  **Actually work when you say you will:** If others respect your maker schedule, you owe it to them to use that time productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. Failing to do so confirms managers' suspicions that empty calendars mean no work is being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### For Organizations
1.  **Consider mandated quiet time:** Implement calendar blocks where entire teams cannot message or meet, either for a specific time each day or full days of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. This ideally applies to teams with makers (engineers, developers, writers, editors, etc.) who require intense, uninterrupted periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. This is particularly important for remote work, where the transparency of "working" is reduced, requiring a higher degree of trust and measuring by output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
2.  **Cultivate a culture of trust and autonomy:** Managers should extend periods of trust, allowing makers to make without constant check-ins, provided they meet deadlines and output expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
3.  **Encourage clarity on "hats":** Entrepreneurs should clearly communicate to their teams whether they are wearing their "maker hat" or "manager hat" for a given day or period, setting expectations for communication and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
4.  **Regularly audit meetings:** Implement a culture where meetings are routinely reviewed and eliminated if unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. This includes deleting meetings at the start of each week and quarterly reviewing recurring meetings to combine or remove attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
5.  **Understand the true cost of meetings:** Organizations often spend significant money on meetings (e.g., 10 people on a 1-hour call could be a $500 expense) without recognizing it as a major cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. A culture where individuals can leave a meeting if they aren't adding value effectively returns time to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
6.  **Spread awareness and shared language:** Distribute content explaining the maker-manager dynamic to all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. This shared understanding helps identify and prevent waste, leading to higher returns on human capital, happier employees, longer retention, and increased quality and quantity of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

## Personal Application of Maker/Manager Time

The speaker's own calendar demonstrates the practical application of these concepts. For a particular week, the speaker had three dedicated maker days with no meetings, focusing solely on creative work like video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The manager day was densely packed with various meetings: team, executive, one-on-ones, and customer calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Many meetings are deliberately *not* on the speaker's calendar because leadership and other teams handle them, representing a "relinquishing of control" essential for [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | entrepreneurial freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

At Acquisition.com, Wednesdays are designated as quiet days organization-wide for makers, allowing them to focus on big projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This structure provides a guaranteed quiet day within two business days, ensuring regular opportunities for [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | deep work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

The speaker outlines three phases of adopting this [[value_of_learning_and_managing_time | time management]] strategy:
*   **V1 (Early Stage):** Maker time occurs during nights, weekends, and early mornings, as the primary job occupies regular hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This requires working "double" â€“ the current job plus the "next job" to transition out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **V2 (Intermediate Stage):** A 50/50 split, with the first half of the day dedicated to maker time and the second half to manager time, often scheduled back-to-front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   **V3 (Current Stage):** Entire maker days (2-4 per week) are balanced with a single manager day where all meetings are stacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This prevents feeling unproductive on manager days, as the expectation is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

This approach is designed to increase awareness of different working styles, helping makers articulate their needs and managers understand the true cost of interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

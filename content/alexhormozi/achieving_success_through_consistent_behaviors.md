Achieving success involves a systematic approach focused on consistent actions and behaviors, rather than merely intentions or external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process can be applied to various aspects of life, including health, relationships, business, sales, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The ultimate goal is to impress one's "future self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## What to Do: Identifying Winning Behaviors

To identify what to do for success, an "invert" process is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This method, attributed to thinkers like Albert Einstein and Charlie Munger, suggests that it's often easier for the human brain to identify problems than solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Our brains are programmed for survival by finding threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The activity involves imagining the least successful version of oneself and identifying actions or inactions that would guarantee failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Examples of behaviors that lead to failure include:
*   Being impatient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Showing up late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   Being unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   Lacking confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Being transactional rather than relational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   Failing to follow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Not advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   Not asking for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

Once these "losing" behaviors are identified, they are inverted to reveal "winning" behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. For instance, being impatient becomes being patient, showing up late becomes always being on time, and not following up becomes always following up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This process leverages our innate ability to find problems for positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## How to Do It: Breaking Down Behaviors into Actionable Steps

Knowing *what* to do is only part of the equation; understanding *how* to do it is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Often, failure to act stems from instructions not being broken down into their most basic, observable forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The more skilled a person is, the more general a command they can follow; the less skilled, the more detailed the command must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Success comes down to aligning the number of skills a person possesses with the number of skills required to understand and execute a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. A single broken link in a chain of instructions can prevent task completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Therefore, to ensure success, behaviors must be broken down to a level where every step is understood and cannot be failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

For example, the general instruction "be more charismatic" can be operationalized into observable actions such as:
*   Smile when people walk in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   Change emphasis and tonality when speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>
*   Remember people's names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
*   Ask people about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
*   Maintain eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   Address everyone in the room upon entering and exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

This approach is the essence of effective teaching and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If something can be learned, it is a skill, and it can be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Traits like charisma, often perceived as innate, are actually "buckets of smaller skills" grouped for convenience in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

[[Behavioral Psychology and Goal Achievement | Operationalizing]] actions means defining them using behaviors that can be seen and measured, excluding feelings, thoughts, intentions, or affirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. By focusing on observable actions, the process of learning and teaching becomes simpler, as one deals only with what can be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Learning, Intelligence, and Confidence

*   **Learning**: Defined as a "same condition, new behavior" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. If a situation presents itself and one's behavior doesn't change, no learning has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Intelligence**: The rate at which one changes their behavior in the same situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. It is the speed of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Being "smarter" means adapting and changing behavior faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Confidence**: The percentage likelihood that something will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Confidence is domain-specific (e.g., confident realtor vs. less confident parent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. To increase confidence, one must create proof by performing the desired action many times, especially in the exact situation where confidence is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Confidence stems from past preparation, not present wishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Why to Do It: Overcoming Obstacles and Maintaining Motivation

Reasons people might not follow through include external and internal conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### External Conditions: The Five Stages of Opportunity Hopping
Many people fall into a cycle of "opportunity hopping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>:
1.  **Uninformed Optimism**: Starting an endeavor with unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
2.  **Informed Pessimism**: Realizing the difficulty and complexity of the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
3.  **Valley of Despair**: Questioning commitment and finding justifications to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Most people jump ship here, repeating the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
4.  **Informed Optimism**: Understanding the process, breaking it into actionable steps, and committing to regular performance and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. This represents knowing "how to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
5.  **Winning**: Achieving the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

[[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | Sticking with things longer]] yields compounding returns and is essential for wealth creation, especially during difficult economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Hard times are when "champions are made" and skills are sharpened, as the market transfers to those who remain standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, implying that challenges provide opportunities to prove capabilities and build enduring character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. What makes someone extraordinary is not just what they do, but [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | how long they are willing to consistently do it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

### Internal Conditions: Motivation and Deprivation

Motivation often stems from deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. When one is hungry, thirsty, or tired, motivation to fulfill those needs is highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. With money, deprivation is psychological rather than physiological; one feels "poor" if a large gap is perceived between current status and desired status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

To increase motivation, one can change who they compare themselves to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. The environment sets one's standards, so changing the environment (e.g., surrounding oneself with higher achievers) can stretch the perceived gap and increase motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. The most effective comparison is to the person one generally wants to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Who to Become: Identity is Action

Contrary to popular belief, becoming a certain type of person (e.g., "honest," "hardworking") is not about "being" but about "doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Identity is a description of consistent behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. As Aristotle stated, "We are what we repeatedly do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

The common "Be-Do-Have" framework is rejected in favor of a "Do-Be-Get" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. [[the_value_of_actions_over_intentions_in_achieving_success | By consistently doing]] the actions associated with the desired identity, one becomes that person, and the results ("have") follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. This makes the person one wants to become 100% under their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. "The work works on you more than you work on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

New identities come with new priorities, shifting how resources are allocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. To be number one, one must consistently do what the number one person does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

## When to Start: Now

Excuses for delaying action often revolve around time:
*   **"Too busy"**: This is actually the best time to change behavior. If a new habit can be sustained during peak busyness, it will stick during easier times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
*   **"No time"**: Everyone has the same 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. If one is busy but not making progress, they are likely doing the "wrong stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. The first step to course correction is often elimination, not addition, of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.
*   **The "When-Then" Fallacy**: This is the belief that one will take action "when" a certain condition is met (e.g., "I'll save money when I have more money") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. This inverts the natural sequence. One must "do" first to "get" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

The ideal time to start is the moment one wants to be their future self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. By beginning to consistently perform the actions of the future self, one *is* that person, and proof will eventually follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

## The [[Process for success in various life areas | Path to Winning]]

The path to winning involves:
1.  **Identify losing behaviors**: Use the "invert" method to list actions that guarantee failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
2.  **Flip to winning behaviors**: Invert the losing list to create a list of positive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
3.  **Break down actions**: Deconstruct general terms into continually smaller, observable, and actionable steps that anyone could understand and perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
4.  **Practice consistently**: Perform these actions until they become second nature, building confidence and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
5.  **Measure success by actions**: Judge progress based on whether the committed actions were completed, not solely on immediate outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This ensures success by making failure unreasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

Life's greatest games—marriage, health, business—are not about "winning" but about "outlasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. This shifts the focus to making decisions that are 100% within one's control: the consistent performance of actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

Hard times are opportunities to prove one's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. What makes things hard is not complexity, but the consistent application of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. [[Role of Patience and Action in Success | Consistent action]], even when boring or without immediate returns, is key to eventual ease and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. [[Patience in achieving success | Doubting whether actions will yield results]] or if one is on the right path is normal, but winners continue to act regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. The focus should be on activities, not internal feelings; one can feel terrible and still win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

The ultimate reminder: if you do not change your behavior, you have not learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

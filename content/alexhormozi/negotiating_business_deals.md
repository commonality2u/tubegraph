Negotiating effective business deals, especially for acquisition, can significantly accelerate financial growth and mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Building strong [[entrepreneurship_and_selling_strategies | entrepreneurial skills]] is paramount, as these cannot be taken away by external factors like divorce, government, revolution, or financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Skills Over Assets

When starting with limited resources, focusing on skill development is crucial. After losing everything, one individual recounted making $110,000 in cash collected sales the following month, demonstrating the power of inherent skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These skills are invaluable and provide a foundation for bouncing back, as seen when an entrepreneur with $1100 in a bank account recovered after having six gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Investment Strategy: Acquiring Businesses

Wealthy individuals often demonstrate a preference for acquiring assets for less money out of pocket, often through creative strategies, and tend to be more risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. They prioritize guaranteed small returns with no risk over potential huge returns with guaranteed risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Business Acquisition vs. Real Estate

Consider two scenarios for investing $50,000:
1.  **Buying a House:** You might put 10% down on a $500,000 house, incurring a monthly mortgage liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This requires significant savings over time (e.g., five years at $60,000/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Acquiring a Business:** Instead, use the $50,000 to acquire an existing business. This approach can yield a much faster increase in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Finding Business Opportunities

*   **Contact Brokers:** While brokers often list businesses at retail prices, they can provide an idea of available businesses and price ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Direct Approach:** To avoid retail pricing and negotiate better deals, reach out directly to business owners, especially those in industries you understand or enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Many owners, even those making substantial profits, may be tired and willing to sell for a lower-than-expected price, even if not formally listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### The Negotiation Tactic: "Agree on Price, Then Agree on Terms"

A key negotiation strategy is to first agree on the purchase price, and then negotiate the terms of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario:**
    *   Find a business making $250,000 in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Agree on a purchase price of $625,000 (2.5 times earnings, often below retail for direct deals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    *   **Terms Negotiation:**
        *   **Seller Financing:** Propose that the seller finance a significant portion, such as three-quarters of the deal (e.g., $437,000), payable over several years (e.g., three to five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
        *   **Bank Loan/SBA Loan:** Secure a loan for the remaining amount (e.g., $200,000), using your initial $50,000 as a down payment (25% of the loan amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Outcome:** You acquire a business generating $250,000 annually with an initial cash outlay of only $50,000, significantly upgrading your income from, for instance, $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Case Study: Acquiring a Gym for Zero Down

An entrepreneur, having previously invested $40,000 for a first gym and $250,000 for a second (which didn't yield more profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, learned to apply this strategy:

*   **Opportunity:** Identified a gym owner who needed to sell due to a family crisis and was looking for a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The gym included expensive equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Negotiation:** Agreed on a price (around $40,000-$50,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Then, negotiated terms to pay over 12 months, resulting in no money out of pocket at the time of acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Results:**
    *   The gym generated $51,000 in sales within the first 30 days, effectively paying for itself immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   It became a cash-flowing asset acquired for nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   Later, the gym was sold for 1.5 times more than the agreed-upon purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

This demonstrates how a patient approach and the "agree on price, then agree on terms" strategy can lead to acquiring [[creative_business_acquisition_and_mergers | cash-flowing assets]] with minimal [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | financial risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

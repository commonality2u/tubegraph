[[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | Damaging admission]] is a powerful [[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | persuasion tactic]] that leverages integrity to build trust with prospects by openly acknowledging deficiencies or negatives with a single statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This technique allows for greater honesty and helps a communicator stand out in a world often filled with exaggerated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Role of Trust in Sales
The extent to which someone will purchase a product or service is directly correlated with how much they trust the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In a business-to-business (B2B) scenario, if a prospect truly believes a promised return on investment (e.g., "for every dollar you give me, you'll make 10 back"), everyone would buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

A clear example of the importance of trust is seen with referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. When a person comes in via referral, they already possess a high level of trust because the referrer has vouched for the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This pre-established trust makes closing the sale significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How Damaging Admission Works: The "But" Amplifier
The [[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | damaging admission]] tactic, reportedly learned from Eminem in *8 Mile* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, hinges on the strategic use of the word "but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The key to its effectiveness lies in the order of statements:
*   **Ineffective Structure:** Positive statement, but negative statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Example: "You're going to make a ton of money if you work with me, but it's going to be a ton of work; there's hundreds of hours of videos you'll have to go through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. (This directs attention to the negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>).
*   **Effective Structure:** Negative statement, but positive statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Example: "You're going to have to go through hundreds of hours of videos; you're going to have to take five hours a day... but you're going to make more money than ever in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### The Amplifying and Diminishing Effect
When "but" is used, it acts as an amplifier for the second half of the statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Everything *after* the word "but" is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   Everything *before* the word "but" is diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

By owning all potential negatives upfront, the subsequent positive claim becomes significantly more believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The more truthful and damaging the initial negatives are, the more credible the positive outcome appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This allows control over where the prospect's attention is directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Real-World Applications
### Product Reviews
Even negative reviews can enhance the credibility of positive ones. A product with 4.7 stars from 3,000 ratings is often preferred over one with 5 stars from only 19 ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is because the [[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | damaging admissions]] (negative reviews) lend credence to the positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

For instance, the speaker notes that Gym Launch, a business he is associated with, has both numerous one-star reviews and thousands of five-star reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This blend of feedback makes the overall offering more believable.

### Advertising Warnings
A famous example of [[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | damaging admission]] in advertising comes from Viagra commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their warning label stated, "If an erection lasts longer than four hours, you must contact a medical professional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
This warning, by acknowledging a genuine risk, paradoxically amplified the perceived power and effectiveness of the product, making it highly desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This principle can be applied to business:
> "Warning: When you sign up and start working with Gym Launch, you're going to massively increase your tax burden. So, like, we are not liable for the amount of taxes that you're going to have to pay as a result of the amount of money we're going to make." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>

By warning about the extreme, negative consequence of a positive outcome (paying more taxes due to making more money), the believability of the promised result is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This makes the entire argument more persuasive and believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | Damaging admission]] is a powerful [[persuasion_tactics_using_the_word_but | persuasion tactic]] rooted in integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. By openly acknowledging potential negatives or deficiencies that prospects might eventually discover, these very points can be used to increase the persuasiveness of an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Incorporating this into sales presentations or copywriting can significantly enhance a prospect's belief and likelihood to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The ability to get strangers to want to buy your products or services is applicable across various industries, including Real Estate, medical, auto, homeowners insurance, healthcare, local businesses, home services, financial services, consumer services, software apps, e-learning, online businesses, and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This knowledge is derived from practical experience, not just theory, as it is used in portfolio companies spanning software, local business, e-commerce, consumer services, medical services, professional services, and home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Proof Over Opinion
The speaker emphasizes that "a man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This philosophy underpins the entire approach to teaching business education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The speaker aims to both show and tell, rather than just provide theoretical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### The "100 Million Dollar Offers" Precedent
The first book, *100 Million Dollar Offers*, addressed the question "What do I sell?" with the answer being an offer "so good people feel stupid saying no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This book itself was designed as a "grand slam offer," demonstrating the principles it outlined, including high value at a low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It has remained a number one bestseller in its categories with over fifteen thousand five-star reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Its success serves as proof that its content works, helping businesses significantly increase their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## The [[Business Growth and Scaling Strategies | Core Four]] Advertising Methods
[[Importance of advertising in scaling businesses | Advertising]] is crucial because if no one knows about your stuff, no one buys it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Knowing how to get more leads provides endless chances to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The "Core Four" methods are the only four ways to let others know about your offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

### 1. Warm Outreach
*   **How it was learned**: The speaker's first business venture was a fitness non-profit called "The Free Training Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Participants donated to charity in exchange for free online training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The speaker reached out to every contact on their friends list, asking if they knew anyone interested in getting in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Out of thousands, six said yes, and after seeing their results, some transitioned to paying the speaker directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This method saved the speaker from an unfulfilling career and started their entrepreneurial journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **How it was used for the book**: Warm outreach is still used, even at advanced stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. For the book launch, the speaker privately reached out to friends and peers, inviting them to the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **How it can be used today**: This method is effective for getting initial customers or launching new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. It works via email, phone calls, direct messages, physical mail, voicemails, or any one-on-one communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content
*   **How it was learned**: After acquiring initial customers through warm outreach, the speaker needed more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The first public advertisement was a Facebook post in April 2013, announcing the "Free Training Project" and a new website to showcase client transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. With proof of results, the speaker began posting fitness content and testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Anyone who interacted with these posts was messaged and offered help, leading to 20 new clients at $200/month, totaling $4,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This method allowed the speaker to sustain themselves in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **How it was used for the book**: For the book launch, content was recorded months in advance, resulting in 143 lead posts and 2,200 total posts across Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The strategy involved continuing regular content alongside promotions, leading to over 400 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The content used the "hook, retain, reward" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, resulting in 194,000 registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This generated the equivalent of $3 million a month in free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **How it can be used today**: This method works to build an audience and generate customers, scaling from one post a week to 250 posts a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Platforms include YouTube, podcasts, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

### 3. Running Paid Ads
*   **How it was learned**: The speaker observed a gym owner using Groupon for new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Believing in this model, the speaker signed a lease for their own gym and launched a Groupon campaign, but it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. After a partner backed out, leaving the speaker with limited savings, they attended a marketing seminar and learned about Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>. The first ad, though "ugliest," was a text-only post looking for five local residents for a free six-week challenge in exchange for before-and-after pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. This ad worked, signing up 29 members before the gym opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>. This success provided just enough cash to cover rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. [[Challenges and lessons in scaling a business | Learning to run paid ads]] allowed the speaker to survive long enough to build the business and eventually sell the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.
*   **How it was used for the book**: Paid ads were run on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The ads followed a simple "what, who, when" framework from the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, spending $275,000 to get 137,000 registrants at approximately $2 per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The ads directed users to a landing page with a 55% opt-in rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **How it can be used today**: Paid ads are the fastest way to get leads, especially for those with no existing following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. They can be started with a few dollars a day and scaled to over $1 million per week across portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. They are simpler than often portrayed, requiring an understanding to explain them simply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

### 4. Cold Outreach
*   **How it was learned**: During COVID-19 in 2020, 100% of the speaker's gym licensing company's (Gym Launch) customers were unable to operate, leading to 30% of gyms permanently closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Ads were failing, and a new way to get customers was desperately needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. A former job applicant, who had lost an offer due to the crisis, revealed his previous company was 100% outbound for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. The speaker hired him to build an outbound machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Within months, sales grew from zero to 30 sales per month, generating $480,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. [[Challenges and lessons in scaling business operations | Cold outreach]] saved Gym Launch during its hardest time and was pivotal in making it a sellable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **How it was used for the book**: The speaker used cold outreach to secure podcast interviews to promote the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. This is an advanced move, combining different advertising types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **How it can be used today**: This involves privately contacting strangers one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. It can be done through knocking on doors, sending DMs, making calls, or leaving voicemails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. It requires a way to contact them, knowing what to say, and persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. It works on SMS, email, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter messengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. It can be started with a tiny budget and scaled significantly, allowing businesses to pick their own leads and target highly qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. The portfolio currently conducts over 15,000 reach-outs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

## The [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | Four Lead Getters]]
While you can use the Core Four methods yourself, the most efficient way to advertise is to have *other people* do it on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This offers significantly higher leverage, meaning less work for higher leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

### 1. Customers (Referrals)
*   **How it was learned/used**: Customers, if satisfied, can use warm outreach to tell others about your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The previous book, *100 Million Dollar Offers*, sold 467,000 copies with zero dollars in paid ads, largely due to customer referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **How it works**: Referrals are valuable because they cost less and convert at a higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. The goal is to have more customers refer than exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. A referral playbook led to $300,000 a week in sales for Gym Launch, and it was discovered accidentally when ads were temporarily shut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. By reverse-engineering and implementing six common factors from successful businesses, the rate of customer retention and referrals tripled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.

### 2. Employees (Team)
*   **How it was learned/used**: Employees can perform the Core Four methods for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. For the book launch, the Mosey Media team created 143 book posts and over 2,200 pieces of content in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### 3. Agencies
*   **How it was learned/used**: Agencies can run ads, post content, or do outreach on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. For the current event, an agency was responsible for running the paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### 4. Affiliates
*   **How it was learned/used**: Affiliates are independent businesses that promote your products to their audience for a commission or freebies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. This creates a leverage effect where selling to 10 affiliates can lead to significantly more customer growth than selling to 10 customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. The speaker's supplement company, Prestige Labs, generated $1.7 million per month in sales with zero paid ads, using 100 affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. This method has generated $75 million in sales from affiliates across portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. For the current event, 23,722 affiliates promoted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

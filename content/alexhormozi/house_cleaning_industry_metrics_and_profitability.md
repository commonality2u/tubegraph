Achieving an enterprise value of $100 million for a business is a feasible goal that does not necessarily require inventing groundbreaking technology like a vacuum cleaner connected to a phone with a camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. If the ambition is $100 billion, then creating "the next Google" would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, but for $100 million, almost any business can reach this valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Case Study: House Cleaning Business

Using a house cleaning business as an example, one can derive the necessary [[Key Sales Metrics and Their Impact | sales metrics]] to achieve a target valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Industry Averages

For a house cleaning service, typical industry statistics can be used for projections:
*   **Average Customer Retention**: Customers generally stay for about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Average Monthly Payment**: An average customer pays around $400 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Net Margins**: The industry average for net margins is approximately 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Path to a $100 Million Valuation

To build a house cleaning business worth $100 million, the following [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue and profit calculations]] can be made:
*   **Required Profit**: To reach a $100 million enterprise value, the business would need to generate between $12 million and $20 million in profit, considering potential multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For safety, a target of $20 million in profit is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue**: With a 20% net margin, $20 million in profit necessitates $100 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Monthly Revenue**: This translates to roughly $8.3 million in revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Weekly Revenue**: Approximately $2 million in revenue per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Daily Sales Velocity**: To achieve these numbers, the business would need to generate about $300,000 in sales per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Business Model Derivation
> The process of deriving a business model typically involves:
> 1.  Determining the daily sales volume required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
> 2.  Calculating the customer lifetime value (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
> 3.  Projecting the total revenue this will create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
> 4.  Understanding the profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
> 5.  Applying the multiple on that margin to determine the business's overall value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The journey of business and personal growth necessitates continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. According to one entrepreneur, the most crucial element in ensuring success from any educational investment is the individual's mindset and approach, not the quality of the teaching itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This perspective highlights that one's personal commitment and a strategic [[approach_to_successful_learning_and_competence_levels | approach to successful learning]] are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Role of Personal Mindset in Achieving ROI

Despite investing over $500,000 in business education—including courses, masterminds, coaching programs, and workshops—the speaker claims to have never had a negative return on investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This consistent success occurred even when dealing with "bad teachers" or "scumbags," underscoring the belief that the individual makes the program work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The core principle is that *you* are the one who makes it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Levels of Competence

To understand how individuals approach learning and execution, a top-down framework of five competence levels can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These levels describe an individual's inclination and active/passive engagement in learning and achieving goals:

*   **Level 1: Positive Active** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
    *   **Characteristics:** Believes that if no one has proven something cannot be done, it *can* be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Takes full ownership of success, aiming to be the best student regardless of the teacher's competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Examples:** Elon Musk, who challenges physical limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>; Roger Bannister, who broke the four-minute mile barrier when it was considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Mindset:** "Prove to me why I *cannot* do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

*   **Level 2: Positive Passive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
    *   **Characteristics:** Believes "if someone else did it, I can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Willing to replicate existing successful methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. These are often "A-minus players" who are highly capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Examples:** People who ran the four-minute mile after Roger Bannister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Mindset:** Replicate before you iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*   **Level 3: Neutral Passive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>
    *   **Characteristics:** Takes a "let's see if it works for me" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Passively accepts outcomes, common among the general population and often leads to mediocre results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Example:** A gym-goer saying, "We'll see if your program works for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

*   **Level 4: Negative Passive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    *   **Characteristics:** Believes "it might work for other people, but it probably won't work for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Often "half-asses" efforts, blaming the system or program when it doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Salon Owner** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
        A salon owner claimed a gift card campaign "didn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Upon review, it was revealed he hadn't followed the instructions correctly, allowing customers to use gift cards for themselves instead of for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. His approach was to blame the system rather than acknowledge his incomplete execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Level 5: Negative Active** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
    *   **Characteristics:** Actively tries to prove that a system won't work for them, believing they are a "special snowflake" with unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Their [[Identity and Personal Transformation | identity is attached]] to being "right" about their limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's easier to blame external factors than accept personal responsibility for lack of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Believing one's body defies calorie laws or that marriage communication advice won't work for their unique relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### The Power of Transformation: Level 5 to Level 1

Interestingly, individuals at Level 5 (Negative Active) have the highest potential for dramatic transformation, often jumping directly to Level 1 (Positive Active) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This occurs when their active energy shifts from proving something *won't* work to proving it *will* work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

*   **Case Study: Gym Owner** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
    A gym owner, initially a Level 5, insisted his market, zip code, and even the "corner his gym is on" were different, preventing success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. After being challenged, he decided to apply the same energy he used to prove the system wrong to proving it *right* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. By fully committing, he transformed his gym into one of the top facilities among thousands, eventually being hired by the program because he outsourced his gym and made it highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The system was the same; his [[approach_to_successful_learning_and_competence_levels | approach to successful learning]] and competence level changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

*   **Case Study: Autumn (Gym Client)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
    Autumn, an early gym client, exhibited Level 5 behavior, claiming "nothing works for me" due to a "special thyroid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. When her peers started losing weight, she was confronted with a choice: "Do you want to be right and fat, or do you want to get skinny?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Choosing to be thin, she committed fully, lost significant weight, became a top client, and a brand ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This highlights a powerful [[Identity and Personal Transformation | identity shift]].

### The Philosophy of "Do, Not Try"

Inspired by figures like Morpheus from *The Matrix* and Yoda from *Star Wars*, the philosophy emphasizes "doing" rather than "trying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
> "Stop trying to hit me... and hit me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
> "There is no try, there is only fail or do and not do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>

"Trying" inherently allows for the possibility of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. A winning mindset, especially at Level 1 or 2, fundamentally believes that if something is not physically impossible, it *will* be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This creates a "no fail" situation where success is an inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

## Building Success from the Ground Up: The Role of Skills

Beyond mindset, success in learning also depends on the skills an individual possesses when entering an educational program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This is the "bottom-up approach."

*   **Skills as Building Blocks:** Education builds sequentially, like adding bricks to a bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Earlier, foundational learning, though seemingly less impactful, is crucial for later success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Attributing all success to the "last brick" (most recent learning) rather than the entire cumulative process is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Meta-Skills and Vagueness:** The more skills (especially "meta-skills" like problem-solving or basic literacy) an individual possesses, the more they can bridge gaps where instructions are vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. A comprehensive skill stack allows for more abstract guidance to be executed effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Learning from Failure (Inversion Thinking):** Even if a program or experience is terrible, it still offers an opportunity for learning through "inversion thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. By identifying what *not* to do, one can still derive immense value and achieve a positive ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This applies to business products, parenting, or relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Replicate Before You Iterate:** A strategic [[approach_to_successful_learning and competence levels | approach to successful learning]] is to first replicate exactly what has been taught to achieve the same results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Only after understanding *why* it worked (by retracing the steps) should one begin to iterate and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Iterating too early, without full comprehension, leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Ultimately, champions create success regardless of conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The choice is whether to be right in your perceived limitations or to achieve the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. True learning and transformation involve proving to oneself, yet again, that one can win no matter what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

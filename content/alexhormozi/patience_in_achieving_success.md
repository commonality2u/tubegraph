Many people expect rapid results, such as a podcast "blowing up" in 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, or getting discouraged by not having an immediate audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, true success often requires significant [[value_of_hard_work_and_persistence | persistence]] and a long-term outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Debunking Overnight Success

The concept of "overnight success" is largely a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, a podcast launched in 2017 took five and a half to six years to just now hit the top 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. During this six-year period, the creator consistently produced one to three podcasts every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Instead of expecting quick results, individuals should recognize that the initial period of any endeavor is for finding one's voice, refining communication style, and learning how to teach, entertain, and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The subject matter and delivery skills both improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Power of Long-Term Thinking

Thinking in terms of days or months for goals can lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Instead, individuals should think in "decades" when setting goals, as this mindset ensures that when that decade passes, it reflects a long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Focus on the Process, Not Just the Outcome

A critical shift in perspective is to make the *action* the goal, rather than solely focusing on the *outcome* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

> "If the action is did I make the post, did I make the reach outs every day, then you're a success, you check both boxes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

This approach is exemplified by a story of a friend who committed to posting valuable short-form content every day for six months before one video took off, leading to significant financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This friend had already been in business for nine years before this content success manifested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### The Trap of Outcome-Based Focus

Many people fall into a cycle where they work hard, achieve some success (e.g., sales, money), then slow down, only to re-engage when they feel scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This happens because they are focusing on the sales and money, rather than the consistent process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

True [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | consistency]] means continuing activities independently of the immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If things are going well, continue the actions that led to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If they are not going well "yet," keep doing the actions to improve enough for success to eventually materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### The Role of Activities in Uniqueness

As highlighted in "Atomic Habits," winners and losers often share the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Everyone wants to be rich or have a six-pack, but goals alone do not make someone unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It is the *activities* that differentiate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The winner commits to the activities, while the loser commits to the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

If someone desires to be a millionaire, the focus should not be on making the million dollars, but on consistently doing the things that lead to a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. By divorcing activities from outcomes, one can focus on "the doing," which helps maintain self-esteem regardless of short-term income fluctuations, because one is committed to what is controllable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Long-Term Commitment and Emotional Stability

A commitment to a long-term approach, such as a decade, sets individuals apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. When asked about "overnight success" after years of effort, the answer is that the outcome was never the goal; the consistent activities were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This perspective helps decrease emotional ups and downs in business, as one's success is tied to controllable actions rather than unpredictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Producing 400 long-form pieces of content, for example, could take eight years if done weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Such a commitment guarantees an increased following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The question is not how long it will take, but rather the commitment to "do the thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

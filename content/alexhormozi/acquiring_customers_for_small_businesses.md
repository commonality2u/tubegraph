Starting a business requires getting customers to turn "trash into cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article outlines the "Core 4" methods for customer acquisition, applicable to various services like trash collecting, fitness, cleaning, or IT services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. These methods include warm outreach, posting free content, cold outreach, and running paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Core 4 Customer Acquisition Methods

### 1. Warm Outreach: Leveraging Your Existing Network

The easiest way to acquire initial customers is by talking to people you already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, starting with your phone contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This method falls under [[building_an_initial_customer_list | building an initial customer list]].

#### How to Approach Known Contacts
When reaching out to someone you know:
*   **Personalize the opening** Use a personalized tidbit, possibly from social media, to start the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Ask a leading question** Instead of asking directly if they need your service, ask about their current situation regarding the problem your service solves (e.g., "Is anyone taking out your trash?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Offer a free trial or "case study"** Provide your service for free to a few people (e.g., five or ten) in exchange for a review or testimonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This helps you get feedback and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Frame it as them helping you** Emphasize that by accepting your free service, they are helping you gather reviews and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Avoid implying they owe you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Request introductions** Ask if they know anyone else who might benefit from your service, and ideally, suggest a three-way text introduction for immediate lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This approach makes it easier for them to act and for the third party to be less rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

#### Outcomes from Free Service (Making Money Three Ways)
Even when offering a free service, you can generate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>:
1.  **Direct Customer Conversion**: They become a paying customer after the free trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  **Review/Testimonial**: They provide a review, which can attract future customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Referral**: They send you a friend or new lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
4.  **Constructive Feedback**: Even if they don't become a customer or provide a referral, their feedback helps you improve your service, leading to long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

#### Limitations of Warm Outreach
This method has two main limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>:
*   **Time**: You only have so much time in the day to make individual calls and outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Network Size**: You only know a finite number of people (e.g., contacts, social media followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While you can re-engage them, you'll eventually hit friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content

Generating free content allows you to gain customers by providing valuable information to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This is a key tactic for [[tactics_for_producing_targeted_content_for_business_owners | producing targeted content for business owners]].

#### Content Framework: Hook, Retain, Reward
Effective content follows a "hook, retain, reward" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>:
*   **Hook**: Grab attention in the first 3 seconds (the most important seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This can be a question, a jarring statement, or a crazy topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Retain**: Keep the audience engaged using lists, steps, or stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Open loops (e.g., "Way number one...", "Way number two...") can encourage continued watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Reward**: The final piece that encourages sharing or taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It can be something funny that subverts expectations or a direct call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

#### Content Strategy Tips
*   **Re-remind, don't just teach**: People need to be reminded more than they need to be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Repurpose content across different formats (tweets, reels, podcasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. If people like something, make more of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Call to action (optional)**: While you can include a direct call to action, simply making engaging content can also lead to comments, likes, or DMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Engagement as leads**: Anyone who likes, engages, or comments on your posts is a lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This engagement provides a legitimate reason to reach out to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This is a method for [[methods_for_advertising_and_generating_business_leads | generating business leads]].
*   **Reframe low views**: Instead of seeing low views as a failure, imagine the view count as the size of a room you're speaking to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. For example, 17 views is a full classroom, which is a significant number of people to reach for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Everyone starts with small numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

#### Content Focus for Local Businesses
For a local service business, content can be targeted in two directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>:
1.  **Consumer-focused**: Provide tips and valuable information to potential customers that improves their lives, regardless of whether they use your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
2.  **Recruitment-focused**: Create content appealing to potential employees to attract talent to your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### 3. Cold Outreach: Reaching Strangers One-on-One

Cold outreach involves contacting strangers individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> through various channels like email, phone calls, direct messages, SMS, voicemails, or even door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

#### Strategies for Cold Outreach
*   **Visual Demonstration**: When doing door-to-door, visually demonstrate your service and dress in work clothes to pique curiosity even before the door opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Customers**: Use a "secret weapon" by name-dropping an existing customer, especially a neighbor, to build trust and disarm the stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This makes them more polite and likely to give you time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Ask a "No-Based" Question**: Instead of "Do you want me to do X?", ask "Would you be *opposed* to me doing X?" or "Would it be an *inconvenience*?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. People are more likely to say "no" to a negative question, which results in a "yes" to your offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is an [[innovative_customer_acquisition_strategies | innovative customer acquisition strategy]].
*   **Offer "Big Fast Value" (BFV)**: Since strangers don't trust you, provide an amazing, superior offer, often free, to incentivize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This is a significant force multiplier for cold outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Handle Objections with Rapport**: If they already have a service provider, pivot by asking if their current provider offers something superior (e.g., "Are they as awesome and smiley as me?" or "Do they do it for free?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Use humor and a positive, upbeat demeanor to disarm people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **Shut Up After the Yes**: Once a prospect says yes, stop talking immediately to avoid increasing the likelihood of them changing their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Embrace Rejection**: Expect and accept "no"s. Every "no" is like a coin tossed into a machine that eventually leads to a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Learning to get rejected and move on is a foundational skill for entrepreneurs, regardless of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

#### Solving Cold Outreach Problems
1.  **Building a Contact List**:
    *   **Software**: Use specialized software to export lists of contacts based on your criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
    *   **Brokers**: Purchase lists from brokers who sell contact information to multiple businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
    *   **"Elbow Grease" (Self-Assembly)**: Manually build a "virgin list" using resources like Yelp, Google Maps, free online databases, or Facebook/Reddit groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This is considered the most valuable method as the leads are not "tired" from other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
2.  **What to Say (Script and Offer)**:
    *   Have a clear script and an amazing "Big Fast Value" offer ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
3.  **Not Enough Replies (Volume)**:
    *   Increase the volume of your outreach efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
    *   Utilize **Automation**: Automate parts of the process, from list building to setting up calling systems and direct messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
    *   **Collaboration**: Work with others to generate more volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

### 4. Running Paid Ads

Paid advertising allows you to reach strangers on a "one-to-many" basis by paying platforms for access to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. This is crucial for [[marketing_and_customer_acquisition_strategies | marketing and customer acquisition strategies]] and can leverage [[personal_experiences_in_scaling_businesses_with_advertising_techniques | personal experiences in scaling businesses with advertising techniques]].

#### Ad Structure: Hook, Meat, Call to Action
Paid ads follow a similar structure to free content but emphasize a strong call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>:
*   **Call-Out**: Before the hook, use visual or auditory cues to immediately signal who the ad is for (e.g., "Las Vegas homeowners...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Hook**: Capture attention within the first 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. This can be a question, a problem statement, or a jarring visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Meat (Problem Agitation & Solution)**:
    *   **Agitate the pain points**: Deeply describe the audience's problems, highlighting the negative impact on their time, status, or comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Using multiple pain points increases the chance one resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
    *   **Present Solutions (e.g., Three Benefits)**: Clearly outline how your service solves these problems, often using a "three things" framework for clarity and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
    *   **Guarantees**: Strategically place guarantees to build trust and offer strong value (e.g., "three free months if we miss a pickup") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: Clearly instruct the viewer on the next step (e.g., "click the link" or "call 1-800-Alex-Trash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

#### Tips for Paid Ads
*   **Test Hooks Heavily**: The hook is the most crucial part as 80% of people decide not to watch an ad in the first 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Test multiple hooks to find what resonates best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Match Avatar to Audience**: The person featured in the ad (their appearance, setting) will do more to attract the right audience than anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
*   **Diverse Representation**: To double or triple your reach, include two, three, or four different people (e.g., men, women) in your ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

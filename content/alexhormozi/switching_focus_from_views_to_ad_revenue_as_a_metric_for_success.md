Initially, the primary metric for content success was the number of views generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. However, this approach had limitations, as views alone do not necessarily translate into business objectives or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

## The Problem with Focusing Solely on Views

A long deal cycle (6-12 months) in the speaker's business meant there was little immediate feedback on content performance beyond driving awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Waiting a year for feedback makes it difficult to quickly adapt and change content behavior for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The theory that entertaining content funnels people to more educational content, and then to becoming customers, was found to be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Entertainment audiences tend to want more entertainment, while education audiences want more education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and these audiences generally do not cross over at an appreciable rate to build a business upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Views for views' sake can be misleading, as they do not always attract the desired audience or lead to tangible business outcomes like book sales, email opt-ins, or business applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## The Shift to Ad Revenue as a Metric

The key realization was that all views are not created equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. A more effective metric was needed to balance quantity (views) with quality (audience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This led to focusing on ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

Ad revenue is calculated based on "RPMs" (Revenue Per Mille), which is the number of views multiplied by the revenue generated per view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

> "It takes into account the quality of the audience." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>

For the speaker, whose target audience includes [[understanding_and_leveraging_audience_targeting | business owners]], who typically have higher spending power, higher RPMs indicate that the content is reaching the desired, high-quality audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

### Why Ad Revenue Works

Ad revenue serves as a paired metric, combining a quantity metric (views) with a quality metric (revenue per view), providing a more comprehensive view of content performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. This allows for faster feedback loops, enabling quicker behavioral changes and improvements in content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

### Real-World Data

Analysis showed a strong correlation: months with the highest RPMs and ad revenue also generated the most book sales, email opt-ins, and business applications, irrespective of the total number of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

An experiment confirmed this:
*   90 days of more edutainment and entertainment-style content led to views "through the roof" (2-3x typical volume) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   However, during this period, ad revenue dropped by half, indicating that the content was attracting the "wrong people" for business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.
*   Conversely, a video with 100,000 views could generate more ad revenue than one with 10 million views, leading to a corresponding increase in desired business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## Benefits for Teams

By providing real-time access to ad revenue data for every piece of content, teams can objectively assess what performs well and what does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. This allows for better decision-making than simply chasing view counts, which may not align with overall business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

This shift means optimizing for a [[focus_on_improvement_over_profitability | leading performance indicator]] that provides nearly real-time feedback, rather than a lagging indicator like total views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The focus is on maximizing the number of the "right people" who discover the content, rather than just maximizing raw numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

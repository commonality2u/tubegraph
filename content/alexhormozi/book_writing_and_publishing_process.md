From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The current focus is on writing "the book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, which is described as a "pretty big deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The author dedicates time to working on it daily, blocking out the morning until noon or one for focused work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This includes having a "book meeting" bi-weekly with two teammates from the non-executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Production and Quality Control
The author manages the printing process directly, working with multiple printers to ensure high print quality, rather than relying on a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Publishing Strategy
The book is not being handled by a traditional publisher because publishers typically do not want authors to give away their books for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The author's father-in-law, who serves as the book manager, runs everything related to the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The author has personally invested a significant amount of money into the book, estimating about 1.2 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. While most publishing companies front the money, doing so for this book would have delayed its release until Spring of 2024, as a book typically needs to be 100% complete nine months before release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. By handling it independently, the book is being released 16 weeks after completion, with 12 weeks of that time allocated for printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Dropshipping real-time printing is an option but is significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

The funds generated from the book (which sells for $2.99, with the author receiving $1) are used to support Mosey Media and its team, enabling them to produce more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### International Translations
Currently, French and Spanish versions of the book are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. There are ongoing discussions and meetings about translating the book into other languages such as Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, and German, and exploring publishing and printing firms in Germany and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Reader Engagement and Branding
The book plays a crucial role in the company's branding strategy, contributing to [[understanding_brand_and_product_development_for_business_success | brand and product development for business success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Readers who gain value from the book are reinforced and rewarded, associating these positive outcomes with the book itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This positive association extends to the author and the company's merchandise, creating a sense of connection and positive feelings among those who interact with the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

This approach aligns with a broader philosophy of motivating individuals through reward or reinforcement, encouraging "discretionary effort" beyond just what's required to avoid punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. In a business based on punishment, people operate at the "law of least effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The goal is to build an environment where everyone works harder because they feel reinforced and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

For example, a child struggling to read was motivated to read entire pages by receiving a Skittle for every three words read and two Skittles for exceeding their previous best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This demonstrates how positive reinforcement can drive learning and higher performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Similarly, the author notes that his own obsession with iterating things until they are "just right" has been reinforced by the rewards he receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The author believes that the current content and production quality will be viewed as significantly less impressive in two years, as new releases are expected to "blow what we are doing out of the water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This long-term vision is encapsulated by the saying, "we think of decades not days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

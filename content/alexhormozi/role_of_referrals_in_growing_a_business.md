This article outlines how initial customers were acquired and how [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] became a crucial step in scaling a business, based on a personal fitness coaching journey that eventually led to making $10,000 online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The journey began with a passion for fitness cultivated since childhood, which was so evident that colleagues encouraged entering the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Initial Spark: The Realization of Profit
The idea of monetizing fitness became tangible after helping Sandy Smith with her food habits. After an hour and a half of discussing nutrition, she wrote a $100 check, which was a "light bulb moment" for the speaker, demonstrating that profit could be made from a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Four Stages to First Customers
The process of acquiring the first customers involved four key stages:

### Stage 1: Homies First (Free Clients)
The first step was to reach out to people who knew and liked the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. Using a phone, a handful of friends were contacted, and about six agreed to be trained for free in exchange for before-and-after pictures and testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. This was done to get "proof" and "results" to build credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>.

> [!tip] Proof over Promise
> Building "proof" is crucial for any business, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">[03:03:06]</a>. A business with many pieces of proof and a terrible offer will often outperform an amazing offer with no proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. The proof needs to be relatable enough for potential clients to believe it will work for them too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Examples included clients losing 50 lbs or achieving body recomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:01">[03:22:01]</a>. This stage took about six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:04">[03:41:04]</a>.

### Stage 2: Asking for Referrals
After getting initial results for the "homies," the next step was to ask them for [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

> [!info] The Importance of Referrals
> [[affiliate_marketing_and_referrals | Referrals]] are considered the most important type of [[methods_for_advertising_and_generating_business_leads | marketing]] for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>:
> -   They are free, making them ideal for those with limited budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:01">[04:03:01]</a>.
> -   They have a higher likelihood of buying at higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:04">[04:09:04]</a>.
> -   They have a higher conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:01">[04:16:01]</a>.
> -   Clients acquired through [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] are also more likely to refer others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:01">[04:22:01]</a>.
>
> From a strategic perspective, if you're not getting [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]], it indicates that your service might not be good enough yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:06">[04:36:06]</a>. It's better to refine your offering with a smaller audience before broadly [[importance_of_advertising_in_scaling_businesses | advertising]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:05">[04:41:05]</a>.

The initial [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] (6 to 10 individuals) received free training, but because it was free, many didn't follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This highlighted a problem with purely free models.

### Stage 3: The Free Training Project (Donation-Based)
To address the lack of commitment in the previous stage, the "Free Training Project" was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:02">[11:56:02]</a>. For this, [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referred]] individuals were asked to donate $500 to $1,000 to a charity of their choice for 3 months of free training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This created "skin in the game" for clients, making them more engaged, while still being free to the trainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. This also generated positive public support due to the charitable aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:17]</a>.

### Stage 4: Skinny to Swole Project (Monetized)
A year after the initial free project, the "Skinny to Swole Project" was launched, where new clients paid $200 a month for 12 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This transition was supported by the transformation pictures from the earlier free and donation-based clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Existing clients from the Free Training Project were easily converted by offering them to pay the trainer directly instead of the charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This model secured 20 clients, generating the first $4,000 per month, totaling $12,000 over 12 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

## Rule of 300: A Modern Application for Lead Generation
The "Rule of 100" (from *100 Million Leads* book) is a fundamental process of applying 100 repetitions to various [[methods_for_advertising_and_generating_business_leads | lead generation]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>:
-   **100 warm outreaches:** Contacting people who know you (e.g., phone contacts, social media friends/followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
-   **100 cold prospects:** Reaching out to people who don't know you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
-   **100 minutes of content creation:** Making and posting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
-   **$100 a day on ads:** Minimum spend on [[importance_of_advertising_in_scaling_businesses | advertising]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

The "Rule of 300" is a more tactical, three-step process for warm outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>:
1.  **Post content:** A single piece on one platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Make 100 comments:** Comment thoughtfully within groups or communities where ideal customers reside. This positions you as knowledgeable without direct solicitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Comments on larger posts can "piggyback" on other people's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
3.  **One-on-one outreach to a "lukewarm" list:** Reach out to anyone who liked your post, commented on your post, liked your comments, or replied to your comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. These individuals have already indicated interest by taking an action, making them engaged leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Begin the conversation by referencing their interaction and asking a relevant question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned: What Worked and What Didn't

### What Worked
-   **Walk the walk (Proof over Promise):** Be the biggest walking billboard for what you sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. Getting results for yourself and others builds credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
-   **Live cheap:** This provides financial runway and security to take bigger risks, like quitting a job to pursue a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Saving money (e.g., by meal prepping, not eating out, finding cheaper alternatives) allows for a longer shot at success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. Working more also helps save money by reducing time to spend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.
-   **Start free:** Offering services for free initially helps gather testimonials, feedback, and [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] that are often worth more than direct payment in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. This is how you build proof and show you "walk the walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>.
-   **Templated one-to-many solution:** Develop systems that allow you to provide high value without extensive time input per client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. For example, a comprehensive Excel sheet for meal plans that could be quickly customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. This investment during the free period builds future efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.
-   **Niching down:** Specializing in a specific problem (e.g., "skinny to swole") allows for more templated solutions and deeper, more specific value to clients, costing less to deliver while being more valuable to the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.
-   **Recurring business model:** A model that allows clients to pay month after month, like fitness coaching, provides consistent income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.

### What Didn't Work (Mistakes to Avoid)
-   **Not ascending clients:** Failing to have a second offer for existing clients after their initial program ends means constantly seeking new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>. Always offer more of what they just bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.
-   **Stopping for "new":** Abandoning a working, profitable online business (e.g., $4,000/month working 4 hours/week) to start something entirely new (like a brick-and-mortar gym) because it felt more "legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>.
-   **No clear offer/sales process:** Lacking a defined offer and a sales process (e.g., phone calls instead of just sending links) limits pricing power and overall revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>.
-   **Judgment:** Making major business decisions based on perceived judgment from others (friends, family) rather than the actual business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>.
-   **Not getting help:** Doing it all solo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. Seeking advice and training accelerates growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.

## General Principles for [[Business Growth and Scaling Strategies | Business Growth]]
The speaker shares 13 instructions given to other entrepreneurs for [[acquiring_customers_for_small_businesses | business growth]] and [[strategies_for_business_growth_through_advertising_and_sales | scaling]]:
1.  **Follow instructions.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>
2.  **Google first:** When encountering an obstacle, search for solutions before asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Post what you learned:** Share solutions after you figure them out to add value to your community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Follow the Rule of 100 daily:** Consistency in inputs leads to consistent outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12:00">[34:12:00]</a>. More inputs per day lead to more consistent, faster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>.
5.  **Work begins when excitement ends:** True work involves confronting discomfort and doing things you don't know how to do, separating you from the "mediocre masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.
6.  **Your work works on you more than you work on it:** You are the product being built, and challenges help you grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.
7.  **Everything is unscalable in the beginning – that's the point:** This period allows you to master every piece of the business, which builds skills and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.
8.  **The pain of repetition forces improvement:** Discomfort from repetitive, difficult tasks drives you to seek better, more efficient ways of doing things, leading to skill acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>.
9.  **Don't complain:** Complaining expends effort without results and seeks pity rather than envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>.
10. **You are not special:** Thousands have succeeded; repeat their actions to get similar outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>. If outcomes differ, it means an unidentified variable exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:00">[38:29:00]</a>.
11. **Write down your "why":** Keep reasons for persistence visible (e.g., escaping a current situation or achieving a goal) as motivation fades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.
12. **Business is shockingly simple but surprisingly hard:** The difficulty lies in consistency, especially when motivation wanes or results are not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>. Potent individuals can work for long-term rewards, unlike those who need immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>.
13. **Just win:** Winning one achievement can be addictive and makes the pain of getting there fade over time, while the achievement itself stays with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.

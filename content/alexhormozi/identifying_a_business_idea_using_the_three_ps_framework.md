This article outlines a five-part [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | framework]] designed to help individuals, especially those new to entrepreneurship, identify a [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] to start, define their target audience, determine how to serve them, and craft an initial message to acquire their first five customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | process]] has proven effective, with more than one out of two people starting a paid community on School.com making their first dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The "What": The Three Ps Framework

The foundation of determining what your [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] will be about is the "Three Ps [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | Framework]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Almost all businesses originate from one of these three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### 1. Pain
This refers to a personal challenge or [[leveraging_problem_identification_for_success | pain]] you have experienced and successfully overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. For example, a friend who developed an efficient system for preparing lunches for her nine children identified this personal [[leveraging_problem_identification_for_success | pain]] point as the genesis of a potential [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### 2. Profession
Your profession encompasses your current or past day job skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Any skill for which people exchange money in a [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. An example is a registered dietitian who, out of necessity, mastered complex insurance billing and then taught that specific skill to other dietitians, generating significant income from a very narrow solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### 3. Passion
Passions are topics that consistently capture your interest, such as articles you read, YouTube videos you watch, or podcasts you listen to in your free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For instance, an individual deeply interested in fitness, constantly consuming related content, was encouraged by colleagues to open a gym due to their evident obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> [!tip] Don't Seek the "Perfect" Idea
> It's a common misconception that you must select the perfect [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] idea on the first attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The initial choice is merely the starting point for an iteration [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | process]] fueled by [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]] feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The goal is to reach your "best bad idea" quickly and then refine it over time until it becomes a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## The "Who": Identifying Your Ideal Customer

Once you have identified your "what" using the Three Ps, the next step is to define "who" you will serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Potential target audiences fall into three categories:

### 1. People Like You
This is often the most effective starting point because you inherently understand their [[leveraging_problem_identification_for_success | pains]], demographics, aspirations, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Solving a personal [[leveraging_problem_identification_for_success | problem]] for yourself, as Sara Blakely did with Spanx, can lead to a massive [[transforming_a_product_into_a_sustainable_business | business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This approach fosters a "missionary" mindset, driving a deeper care for the product and [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### 2. People You've Helped Before
This includes individuals you've assisted, whether for money or as a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The speaker's first dollar earned came from spontaneously helping a gym acquaintance with her diet, demonstrating that informal assistance can reveal monetizable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### 3. Underserved Markets
This is a more formal approach, involving identifying growing markets with unmet demand or emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

> [!info] Refining Your Customer Avatar
> To clearly define your target audience, consider five frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:
> *   **Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
> *   **Gender** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
> *   **Profession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
> *   **Problems/Pains** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   **Interests/Passions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
>
> You should pick at least three of these to narrow down your avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. For example, "35-year-old male accountants who are bored at their jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The goal is to be specific enough that when you describe your [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]], they feel you are speaking directly to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

> [!warning] Narrowness Does Not Limit Income
> A common belief is that narrowing your focus limits potential income by reducing the number of people you can sell to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. However, the more specific you are, the more you can charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. For example, a general "time management" product might sell for $19, but an "entire outbound time management system for garden and power tools sales" could command $10,000 due to its highly specialized value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Specificity reduces competition, creating a "blue ocean" market where you are the sole provider of a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## The "How": Defining Your Solution

The "how" defines the solution you provide, encompassing both positive outcomes and avoided negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### How Part One: The Upside (Good Stuff)
This describes all the positive achievements and experiences your [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]] will gain by using your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Consider how your solution makes their lives:
*   **Easier**: How much less effort will they expend? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   **Guaranteed**: How certain is the desired outcome? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>
*   **Faster**: How quickly will they achieve their goals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>
*   **Exactly What They Want**: How does it align with their ideal scenario? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>

These four elements represent the positive aspects of the value equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### How Part Two: The Downside (Bad Stuff)
This focuses on the undesirable experiences or sacrifices your solution helps the [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]] avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Motivation is driven by either gaining something good or avoiding something bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. You should be able to describe:
*   **Risks avoided**: What negative consequences will they no longer face? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>
*   **Slowness avoided**: How does your solution prevent the slow, painful [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | process]] they might otherwise experience? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>
*   **Pain and sacrifice avoided**: What difficult actions or beloved activities do they *not* have to give up or *not* have to start doing with your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>?

> [!question] How to Gather "How" Information?
> If the [[leveraging_problem_identification_for_success | pain]] is not personal, the "ask people" method is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Conduct interviews with potential [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customers]] by asking questions such as:
> *   What problems are you currently struggling with? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>
> *   How long have you struggled with them, and what makes it specifically painful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
> *   Can you describe your ideal experience if this problem were solved? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>
> *   What things do you have to stop doing that you like, or start doing that you hate, when trying to solve this problem with other solutions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>
> The answers to these questions will form the basis of your "good stuff" and "bad stuff" descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Putting It All Together: The Business Statement

Combine all the elements into a concise statement using the "Mad Lib" formula:
"I help [Who] get [Good Stuff] without [Bad Stuff] (through [Unique Mechanism])" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

**Example:** "I help 45-year-old women who just had kids get back into their high school jeans without giving up time with their family." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>
The more specific you are, the more your target [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customer]] will recognize themselves and their needs in your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## Bonus 1: The Unique Mechanism

A [[developing_a_unique_process_or_mechanism_for_your_business | unique mechanism]] is what differentiates your solution from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. It's the "special sauce" that makes a prospect believe your solution is the missing piece to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

This mechanism is essentially your proprietary [[developing_a_unique_process_or_mechanism_for_your_business | process]], which can be presented as:
*   A **checklist**: A list of things someone must do to achieve a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   A **sequence of steps**: A defined order of actions to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Once formalized, you name this [[developing_a_unique_process_or_mechanism_for_your_business | process]], making it your distinctive method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Examples include P90X's "muscle confusion" or Weight Watchers' "point system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This [[developing_a_unique_process_or_mechanism_for_your_business | unique mechanism]] acts as the vehicle guiding [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | customers]] from their current state to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## Bonus 2: Getting Your First Five Customers

To acquire your first five customers, implement a simple outreach system:
1.  **Greet someone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  **Mention something specific about them as a compliment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
3.  **Insert your combined business statement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
4.  **Ask if they know anyone who could benefit from that** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Perform this [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | process]] for four hours a day or until you reach 100 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Consistent application of this method will lead to securing your first five customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

A privately held chain is a business model where an owner expands their successful single location by opening additional locations, while retaining all ownership rights and control over the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This means the owner takes all the risk, fronts all the capital, hires all the labor, and manages everything end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Characteristics and Considerations

*   **Expansion Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   One location is opened, then a second, and a third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Example: A salon concept for hair that wanted to open more locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   The enterprise value (EV) for a private chain is considered "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Ownership and Control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
    *   The owner retains all ownership rights, controls the brand, and manages everything end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Pros of a Private Chain Model

*   **Full Ownership of Revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
    *   If opening new locations is inexpensive and profitable, owning the entire revenue stream is more beneficial than sharing it through licensing or franchising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. An example portfolio company transitioned from a licensing model to a private chain, leading to significant revenue growth (from $0.5 million to $12 million/year in 14 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Cons of a Private Chain Model

*   **Highest Opening Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
    *   There are incremental costs for each new location, including build-out, location scouting, lease negotiation, and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Significant Risk and Capital Investment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
    *   The owner takes all the risk and must front all the capital for each new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   This includes the risk of the lease for its entire duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Labor and Staffing Responsibilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
    *   The owner is responsible for hiring and controlling all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Challenges with Specialized Services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
    *   Scaling a private chain becomes more difficult if the service requires highly specialized skills, leading to inconsistency in service provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   To be scalable, the service should be "productized" to minimize variability and decrease the skill requirements of the labor needed to operate the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## When a Private Chain is Worthwhile

A private chain is worth considering under specific conditions:

*   **Low Build-Out Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
    *   If the cost to build a new location is low relative to the income it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Specifically, if the cost is less than six months' worth of profit from the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Example: Insomnia Cookies has tiny locations requiring only an oven and a front door, making it very low to build with high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Low Service Requirements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
    *   The business model should allow for minimal variability and low skill requirements for labor, making the service easily replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Example: Subway's success is attributed to anyone being able to make a consistent sandwich using the same recipes and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Certainty of Success in New Markets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
    *   If there's a strong certainty of success when entering a new market and the cost to open is low, then owning the whole thing privately makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Many of the world's biggest brands started as private chains before potentially moving to other models or expanding directly to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Examples include product-based businesses like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Christian Dior, where the build-out costs are minimal compared to the profit generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

This article outlines various high-protein, low-carb, and low-fat recipes designed for minimal preparation time and maximum convenience. These recipes aim to provide significant protein intake for muscle growth or dieting, with one featured meal exceeding 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Breakfast Options

### Greek Yogurt Protein Bomb
This recipe offers a filling breakfast with nearly 100 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> and minimal preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
    *   Fage 0% Greek Yogurt (or similar 0% fat Greek yogurt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
        *   One tub contains 94g protein and just under 500 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
        *   Yogurt is often easier to digest than milk for those with dairy sensitivities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Artificial Fruit Punch Flavor (e.g., Crystal Light Fruit Punch or Berry Sangria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Fruity Pebbles cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
        *   One cup contains 140 calories and 30g carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For dieting, a half cup provides 70 calories and 15g carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

*   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
    1.  Pour Greek yogurt into a bowl (or keep in its container to avoid dishes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    2.  Add about half a packet of the fruit punch flavor to the yogurt and mix thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This step also provides a "forearm pump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    3.  Sprinkle Fruity Pebbles on top. To maintain crunchiness, sprinkle a layer, eat it, then add another layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **Cinnamon Toast Crunch Version** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>
    *   Instead of Crystal Light, use vanilla extract and one or two packets of artificial sweetener (or real sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
    *   Top with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
    *   For a fancy touch, dust with cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

### Microwaved Egg Whites with Salsa
This meal is described as "ghetto fabulous" due to its simplicity and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
    *   Ultra-pasteurized egg whites (e.g., a "tall boy" carton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>
        *   A tall boy carton contains 100g of pure protein with 0g fat and 0g carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
    *   Salsa (canned or jarred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>
        *   Salsa typically has very few calories (5 calories per serving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

*   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>
    1.  Pour desired amount of egg whites into a microwave-safe bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
    2.  Microwave the egg whites until they puff up (around 90 seconds for 1 cup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
    3.  Top with salsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Egg whites expand significantly when microwaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

### Chocolate Egg Whites
This is an [[unconventional_diet_explanation | unconventional]] way to get protein.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>

*   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>
    1.  Pour egg whites into a shaker bottle or cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
    2.  Add a few tablespoons of Hershey's Zero Sugar Syrup (adjust to desired sweetness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
    3.  Shake vigorously until mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: Drink about 95% of the mixture, as the last 5% can be gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### Protein Cereal
This combines Premier Protein cereal with a protein shake for a chocolatey breakfast.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>
    *   Premier Protein Cereal (or similar protein-fortified cereal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>
        *   One cup has 180 calories and 20g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
    *   Premier Protein Shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>

    1.  Pour desired amount of cereal into a bowl (e.g., three cups for 60g protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
    2.  Pour a Premier Protein shake over the cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: For crunchiness, pour the shake first, then add cereal a scoop at a time, rather than dumping it all in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
    *   **Macros**: This combination can provide 90g protein and 700 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Lunch/Dinner Options

### Salmon and Fat-Free Cream Cheese on Ezekiel Bread
A consistent meal for years due to its ease and macros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
    *   Ezekiel bread (or other low-calorie bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
        *   One slice of Ezekiel bread is 80 calories, 5g protein, 15g carbs, almost no fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Fat-free cream cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
    *   Low-fat lox/salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
        *   Low-fat fish is primarily protein, similar macros to chicken breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

*   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
    1.  Toast the Ezekiel bread (using a speed toaster for quickness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    2.  Mash the salmon into a "salmon tartar" consistency to prevent tearing when biting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    3.  Spread cream cheese on one slice of bread, then layer the mashed salmon on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    4.  Alternatively, for optimal texture, keep cream cheese and salmon separate and apply bite-by-bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This keeps the bread crunchy and cream cheese cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   **Serving Suggestion**: Eat as open-faced sandwiches to reduce carb intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Aim for around 100g protein per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, which may require multiple "open-face puppies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **Macros**: Three open-face sandwiches with 4oz salmon, bread, and cream cheese yields ~90g protein. Calories are around 240 (bread), 100-200 (cream cheese), plus salmon protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

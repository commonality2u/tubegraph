Understanding and serving the right audience is crucial for business success, often more so than the product or service itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Choosing [[how_to_identify_and_serve_a_target_audience | the right people]] to sell to can significantly increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Value Derives from the Audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

The value a business receives is often determined by the inherent value of the customer, not just the quality of the service provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. For example, a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) agency performing the same work on a $1 million e-commerce business and a $100 million e-commerce business could generate $100,000 and $10 million in increased revenue, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This allows the agency to charge significantly more ($3.6 million vs. $36,000) for the exact same work, simply because the client was inherently more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This concept is referred to as "leverage" – getting more out for what you put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The principle is that if you are not being valued, it's often due to the people who are placing the value on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The value derived is more about [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | who you find]] than necessarily what you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. A simple act, like pushing a broken-down car, yielded a mortgage payoff for a Good Samaritan because he helped a billionaire, whereas most people would only receive a thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Therefore, actively choosing [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | clients who provide more value]] and are less demanding is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Being able to say "no" to problematic clients creates room for more valuable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Desirable Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>

When selecting a market to pursue, four key characteristics should be considered:

1.  **Pain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
    *   Do they have a problem that needs solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>?
    *   Find the "starving crowd" within a market – sub-segments that are underserved, have a strong need, and possess money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Selling hot dogs outside a stadium to a drunk crowd is easier than trying to sell them in a less opportune location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

2.  **Purchasing Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>
    *   Do they have the financial means to purchase your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>?
    *   An example of targeting unemployed people for resume help failed because they lacked the income to afford a consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Transparently communicating price early on can help filter for prospects with purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

3.  **Easy to Find** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
    *   Can the target audience be easily aggregated and advertised to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>?
    *   Targeting "rich doctors" is easier than a dispersed audience because they are often found in associations, Facebook groups, and professional services, making [[choosing_the_right_platform_for_outreach | advertising and outbound efforts more efficient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

4.  **Growing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
    *   Is the market expanding or shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>?
    *   As Warren Buffett noted, it's better to be in a growing "boat" (market) even with the same effort, because the market itself can dictate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. A great manager in a declining market (like newspapers) will struggle, whereas someone in a growing market will experience default growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

By strategically [[understanding_and_leveraging_audience_targeting | targeting the right people]] and markets, businesses can significantly improve their outcomes, increase profitability, and stack the deck in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This proactive approach to [[role_of_ad_targeting_in_business_success | audience selection]] ensures that efforts are directed toward those who are most likely to value and benefit from the offering, leading to a [[branding_and_audience_engagement | more rewarding business experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

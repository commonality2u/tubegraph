To achieve an [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | enterprise value]] of $100 million, it is not necessary to invent highly complex products like a vacuum cleaner that connects to a phone with a camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While aiming for $100 billion would require creating something on the scale of the next Google, an enterprise value of $100 million is potentially achievable for "any business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Calculating Enterprise Value

The process of [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | business valuation]] often begins by defining the target [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | enterprise value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This value is derived by working backward from a target profit, considering [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | net margins]] and industry multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Example: House Cleaning Business

Consider a house cleaning business aiming for a $100 million [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | enterprise value]]:
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Based on industry statistics, an average customer might stay for 2 years and pay $400 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Industry Net Margins:** The industry average for [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | net margins]] is typically around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Target Profit:** To achieve a $100 million [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | business valuation]], the business would need to generate approximately $12 million to $15 million in profit. To be conservative, or due to lower industry multiples, a target profit of $20 million might be aimed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Required Revenue:** If the target profit is $20 million and the [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | net margin]] is 20%, the business needs to achieve $100 million in total [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   This translates to roughly $8.3 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Or approximately $2 million per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   Further broken down, this means about $300,000 per day in [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Deriving Business Models

This method of "backing in sales velocity" from daily [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] targets and customer lifetime value is a common approach to [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | deriving business models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The general process involves:
1.  Determining the required daily sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  Understanding the worth of each customer (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  Calculating the total [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] that will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
4.  Identifying the [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | margin]] on that [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
5.  Applying the appropriate multiple to that [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | margin]] to determine the business's [[wealth_alchemy_and_business_valuation | enterprise value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

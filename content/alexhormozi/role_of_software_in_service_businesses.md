Software can be a significant vehicle for packaging services, knowledge, and labor into a profitable business, especially for those looking for high enterprise value on exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While not suitable for all service types, such as hair cutting, it is applicable where software can automate or enhance the service provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Software as a Business Model

This model involves creating a "software tech-enabled service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For most service-based businesses, this might be a less common path compared to private chains, franchises, or licensing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Key Considerations and Challenges
*   **High Development Cost & Time**: Building software requires a significant upfront investment in terms of both money and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Low Initial Cash Flow**: Unlike licensing, which can generate cash flow from day one, software typically experiences very low cash flow during its development phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Expertise Requirement**: Success in software development necessitates strong internal capabilities. It is strongly advised against outsourcing development to third-party teams, as this often leads to failure, potentially costing millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Ideally, a business should have a software co-founder skilled in coding, user experience (UX), and building engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Enterprise Value and Retention
The primary advantage of a software model is its potential for extremely high enterprise value upon exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. However, to achieve a high valuation, a critical factor is customer retention:
*   **High Yearly Retention**: To be considered a valuable software company by investors, a business needs to achieve 80% or higher yearly customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Impact of Low Retention**: If retention rates fall below 80%, the business may not be valued as a software company but rather as a normal service business with merely a "tech element," diminishing its perceived value despite the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

In summary, choosing software as a [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | delivery model]] for [[scaling_a_servicebased_business | scaling a service-based business]] is a strategic decision that trades immediate cash flow and ease of setup for long-term enterprise value, provided stringent retention and development requirements are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. When [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | evaluating business frameworks for growth]], considering the upfront investment, time commitment, and risk appetite is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

For business owners and high-level employees, understanding and applying the right "work" can be the most tactical way to generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Many individuals claim to work hard but struggle to define what "work" truly means in a business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Defining "Work" in Business

The scientific definition of work (force x distance) is not useful for knowledge workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Defining work by hours spent or effort expended is also insufficient because many people work long hours or try hard without achieving significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

A more effective definition of work for business is:
> Work = Outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
> Outputs = Volume × Leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

*   **Volume**: The number of times you do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: How much you get out of each time you do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

To work "faster" or do more work per unit of time, the formula is (Volume × Leverage) / Time, which translates to "output per unit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. High output results from high volume on good leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Key Business Growth Levers

To grow a business, there are fundamentally two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:
1.  Get more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> (sell more units).
2.  Make existing customers worth more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> (increase Lifetime Value - LTV).

These can be broken down into specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>:

### 1. Getting More Customers
*   **Generate More Traffic**: Advertise more and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Increase Conversion Rate**: Practice sales or improve your offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### 2. Making Customers Worth More
*   **Raise Prices**: Simply decide to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Decrease Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Increase Purchase Frequency/Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
    *   Conduct reach-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Perform exit interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Implement pre-payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Improve onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   Deliver faster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Host events to appreciate members or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Many businesses spend their "working" time doing almost none of these critical activities, which leads to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Prioritizing Growth Activities
For most businesses, especially smaller ones, effort should be disproportionately focused on getting more traffic (advertising) and increasing conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Without customers, there's no one to upsell or increase LTV for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Strategies for Effective Advertising (Traffic Generation)
To advertise "more and better," one must advertise more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Excellence comes from repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To become exceptionally skilled at advertising, engage in so much advertising that it would be unreasonable to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Examples of dedicated advertising "volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:
*   **Running Ads**: Commit four hours a day to scripting, analyzing, writing copy, and recording ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This may include learning editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Outreach**: Spend four hours a day reaching out to people across social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Content Creation**: If content is the primary advertising method, create content for four hours a day, every day, on every platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Partners/Affiliates**: Dedicate four hours a day to outreach or creating content to help affiliates send more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

These actions become the "volume" that generates leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If you're concerned about finding four hours a day, remember that "doing everything else" is often what keeps businesses stalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

> "If you keep doing the same stuff and your business isn't growing then the stuff that you're doing is wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

This is the essence of [[key_business_strategies_for_growth | strategy]] and [[strategies_for_business_growth_and_improvement | business growth strategies and challenges]]: prioritizing what's most important, even if it means neglecting other things for a season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. When a specific area becomes the "limiter" or "constraint" of the business, it then demands four hours a day of focused effort until resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Strategies for Sales Conversion
Once traffic is mastered and leads are abundant, if conversion is the bottleneck, shift focus to optimizing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Activities to optimize conversion include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>:
*   Tracking close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Recording all sales interactions and reviewing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Watching "game tape" of successful sales calls every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Practicing sales scripts aloud daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Hiring someone to provide daily feedback on sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   Implementing a two-minute mental prep before every sales consult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Using a pre-sale questionnaire for every person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Qualifying people better on the phone to pre-sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

All problems are solvable with skills, and all skills are attainable through repetition and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Once a skill is mastered, it takes less time to perform, providing "leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This shifts effort from "growing a skill" to "maintaining a skill," which is significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Every minute spent must clearly lead up to one of these four core growth activities (traffic, conversion, price, LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Finding and Buying Time for Growth
Success in the marketplace doesn't care about excuses; it cares about output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Everyone has 24 hours a day; those who move faster use their time more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Finding Time: Maker vs. Manager Time
Entrepreneurs typically have two types of work time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>:

*   **Maker Time**: Long, uninterrupted blocks (4-6 hours) for high-importance, low-urgency work that moves the business forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Interruptions can destroy an entire block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. A productive maker calendar is an empty calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Manager Time**: Small, fragmented blocks (5-15 minutes) for training teams, coordinating, communicating, and putting out fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. The goal is to fill the calendar with these slots when in manager mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Disaster occurs when manager tasks bleed into maker time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. It is crucial to understand and communicate the difference between these work types to your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Maker Habits
To facilitate maker time:
*   Decide on one most important project to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   Wake up early (e.g., 4:00 AM) and work for a substantial block (e.g., until 9:00 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Turn off all notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   Create an environment with minimal distractions (dark room, no windows, earplugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   Realize there are no true "emergencies" in business outside of life-or-death situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, including weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   Be aware that drinking alcohol can cost two days of productivity (day of drinking + day of recovery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   Utilize weekends as a "hack" for uninterrupted work time (104 days a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Buying Time
As the most valuable person in your business, maximizing your productive moments is crucial, just as you would for a star employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Productivity increases more by eliminating unproductive things than by optimizing existing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Cutting things out provides permanent reductions in energy drainage, which can be reallocated to making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

By outsourcing low-value personal tasks, significant time can be reclaimed:
*   **Food (groceries, eating, prepping, cleaning)**: ~50 hours/month. Replacement cost: $800/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Home Cleaning**: ~25 hours/month. Replacement cost: $500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Laundry (washing, drying, folding, organizing, dry cleaning, driving)**: ~16 hours/month. Replacement cost: $200/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

For approximately $1,500 a month, you can regain 96 hours (two full work weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. If you can make more than $15/hour with your time, this trade is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This is a form of reinvesting in yourself, but the time bought must be used for valuable work, not leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

Many entrepreneurs hesitate to spend money on services that make them "feel fancy" or "frilly," despite being willing to hire an employee for $50,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This is illogical, as investing in your most valuable employee (yourself) to gain 50% more output is a clear win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Consider the potential for exponential [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | growth and scaling strategies]]:
*   Someone working three productive hours per week vs. someone working 96 productive hours per week (from buying time and focused maker habits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This can lead to a 30x faster pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

> "You will become more productive through elimination than by adding optimization." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>

This approach allows entrepreneurs to manage daily operations (manager time) while also dedicating substantial time to high-impact growth activities (maker time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. By eliminating distractions and low-value tasks, one can work 30 times more effectively than competitors who are distracted and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

The secret to rapid [[fast_business_growth_strategies | fast business growth strategies]] and compressing "multiple lifetimes of growth into one" is to maximize your time and eliminate as many energy drains as possible that are not aligned with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

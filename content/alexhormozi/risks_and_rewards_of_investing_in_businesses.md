Investing in businesses, particularly through private equity, offers substantial wealth creation opportunities, often surpassing traditional real estate investments at the highest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach focuses on accelerating business value by making strategic moves that reduce risk and increase profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Real Estate vs. Business Investment

The majority of millionaires are made in real estate, while billionaires often find their fortunes in private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Real Estate Model
In real estate, money is typically made in two primary ways:
1.  **Appreciation:** The value of the property increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This can be natural appreciation or "forced appreciation" through improvements like renovations (e.g., adding a kitchen or cleaning windows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Rental Income:** Receiving consistent payments from tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Real estate is considered a simpler business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. As long as population growth continues, real estate is generally a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. However, there's an upside limit; 100x returns are unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. A significant [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risk]] is population decline, as seen in Japan's real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Private Equity / Business Investment
Private equity offers more diverse ways to make money and allows for a much wider range of acquisition prices, with some businesses even being acquired for free, especially if they have no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Businesses can accelerate in value dramatically; a business can go from not valuable to hundreds of millions of dollars in 12 months, especially with technology or patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

A key strategy in private equity is to identify negatives or [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risks]] associated with a business and then transform them into "pillars of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This effectively counts twice, removing a negative discount and adding to the business's multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Unlike real estate, you can fundamentally change a business's "neighborhood" or category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It's possible to achieve 100x returns in private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## How Value is Created in Businesses

The valuation of a business is primarily determined by two variables:
1.  **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** Essentially, the company's profit before certain accounting and financial deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Multiple:** A multiplier applied to the EBITDA to determine the business's overall value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

The multiple ascribed to a business's profits is directly correlated to the [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risk]] associated with it, or rather, how likely it is to continue making money reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Small vs. Valuable Business
Consider two businesses:
*   **Business A:** $3 million in revenue, $1 million in profit. Has keyman risk (founder integrally involved), few employees, volatile, and screams [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. It's likely unsellable to an external buyer, although the owner derives value from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Business B:** Starts similar, but with a few strategic moves (e.g., hiring a CEO/COO, updating sales/marketing, optimizing pricing), it reaches $12 million in revenue and $5 million in profit in 12-24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. If it gets an 8x multiple, it becomes a $40 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

This demonstrates the arbitrage in private equity, where huge step-ups in value can be created with relatively small changes and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Three Ways to Increase Business Value
Fundamentally, there are three ways to make a business more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>:
1.  **Increase Customers:** Grow the customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Increase Customer Value (LTV/LGP):** Make existing customers worth more over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Decrease Risk / Increase Reliability:** Make the business's future earnings more predictable and secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

Every allocation of time or money in a business should clearly contribute to one of these three objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

## [[Strategies for increasing business value | Key Levers for Increasing Business Value]]

Experienced private equity investors use specific levers to increase the multiple and, therefore, the value of a business.

### A. Debt Carrying Capacity
The amount of debt a business can support is a function of its cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Businesses with high, reliable cash flow can take on significantly more debt, which amplifies returns for investors through [[leverage_and_its_types_for_maximizing_business_success | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

### B. Organic Growth
Consistent organic growth (through marketing, sales, and pricing strategies) significantly increases a business's multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. If a business can reliably grow 20% year-over-year, it can more than double in five years, leading to substantial returns for investors due to [[leverage_and_its_types_for_maximizing_business_success | debt leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. This is a core component of [[investment_and_company_growth_strategies | investment and company growth strategies]].

### C. Categorization
Reclassifying a business type can dramatically increase its multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. For example, transitioning a traditional service business into a "Tech-enabled service" or even a "SaaS" (Software as a Service) business by integrating technology can lead to significantly higher multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. An investment of $100,000 to streamline processes and implement tech might add $3 million to the enterprise value, representing a 30x return on that specific investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

### D. Size Premiums
Contrary to wholesale buying where bulk is cheaper, businesses gain a "size premium" when they reach a certain scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. A business doing $100 million in profit is worth significantly more per dollar of profit than one doing $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. Institutional investors like BlackRock and Blackstone have minimum check sizes (e.g., $150 million), meaning they only consider very large acquisitions, for which they pay a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. Institutional interest typically begins at around $5 million in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. Crossing the $10 million profit mark further enhances the multiple, creating a double multiplier effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. This illustrates a key aspect of [[investment_and_financial_advice_for_business_growth | investment and financial advice for business growth]].

### E. Age (Patience)
The age of a business also contributes to its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. An older, more established business (e.g., 10 years old) doing the same numbers as a younger one (e.g., 1 year old) is generally perceived as less [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risky]] and more reliable, thus commanding a higher valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:21:00]</a>. A business becomes more valuable every year it continues to grow or even maintain its position, until it declines, at which point its value can plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[business_growth_strategies_and_challenges | sustained business growth strategies]].

## Importance of Focus and Long-Term Commitment

Many people fail to get rich because they don't understand where value is created and fail to focus their efforts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Constantly switching between "opportunity vehicles" or starting new side hustles every six months prevents compounding value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

[[risks_of_diversifying_in_business_too_early | Diversifying too early]] by jumping to new opportunities means missing out on the compounding growth and increasing multiples that come with sticking with a single business over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>. A mediocre opportunity executed consistently for a long period (e.g., 50 years) will yield far greater returns than constantly switching to seemingly superior, but inconsistently pursued, opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>. This long-term focus is crucial for [[building_a_valuable_business | building a valuable business]] and achieving generational wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

Most of the value creation levers in private equity (like categorization, size premiums, and age) take time and consistent effort to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. This is not a "get rich in six weeks" scheme, but rather a "get rich in six years" approach, which is considered a relatively short timeframe for such substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

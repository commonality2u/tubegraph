When beginning your outreach efforts to acquire your first customers, a crucial step is selecting the appropriate communication platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## How to Select Your Platform

After compiling a comprehensive list of potential contacts from various sources (email, social media, phone contacts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, the next step is to pick one platform to initiate your messaging or emailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

The recommended strategy is to start with the platform where you possess the largest number of contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. For instance, if you have the most followers on Instagram, or the most contacts in your email list or phone, that's where you should begin your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

This initial outreach strategy, focusing on personal networks, is part of broader [[leveraging_content_and_outreach_to_increase_business_profitability | outreach efforts]] and [[community_engagement_strategies | engagement strategies]] designed to secure early customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This approach differs from [[introduction_to_different_advertising_platforms | advertising platforms]], as it leverages existing personal connections.

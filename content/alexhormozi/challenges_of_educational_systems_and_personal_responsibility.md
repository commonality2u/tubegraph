Success in any endeavor, particularly business, hinges on continuous growth and learning. The speaker emphasizes that personal [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | success]] is not dependent on the quality of the teaching or system, but rather on the individual's commitment to making it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This perspective highlights the importance of [[taking_responsibility_for_personal_financial_situation | personal responsibility]] in achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Personal Investment in Education

The speaker has invested over $500,000 in business education through courses, masterminds, coaching programs, and workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the quality of instructors, he consistently became the top student and often surpassed the teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This underscores the idea that [[role_of_selfeducation_and_experiential_learning | self-education]] and active participation are key. He claims to have never had a negative return on investment (ROI) from any educational purchase, even from "bad teachers" or "scumbags," because he always made the purchase yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### The Fundamental Question: "How do you know it's going to work?"

According to the speaker, asking "How do you know it's going to work?" fundamentally implies it *won't* work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The success is not inherent in the program or teacher, but in the individual's effort and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Five Levels of Competence

The speaker outlines a "top-down approach" to competence, categorized into five levels, which impact an individual's ability to learn and succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### 1. Positive Active (Highest Competence)
Individuals at this level believe that if no one has proven something *cannot* be done, then it *is* possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. They challenge others to prove why they *can't* achieve a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Their mindset is "I will be the best student, no matter how incompetent the teacher; I will make it happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This means they internalize the [[decisionmaking_power_and_personal_development | decision-making power]] for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Examples include Elon Musk's first-principles thinking and Roger Bannister's first 4-minute mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. "Winners will win" regardless of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### 2. Positive Passive
These individuals are motivated by seeing others succeed. They say, "Okay, he did it, so I can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is still a strong position for [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | success]], focusing on replication before iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### 3. Neutral Passive
The majority of people fall into this category. They adopt a "let's see if it works for me" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. They passively accept whatever happens, making them "mediocre customers" or participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 4. Negative Passive
These individuals believe a system "might work for other people, but it probably won't work for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. They often "half-ass" the process and blame the system when it doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. A salon owner blamed a gift card campaign for not working, but admitted he didn't follow the instructions correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This illustrates a lack of [[taking_responsibility_for_personal_financial_situation | personal responsibility]].

### 5. Negative Active (Bottom of the Barrel)
This is the lowest level of competence, characterized by actively trying to *prove* that something *won't* work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. They claim unique circumstances or "bad luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This mindset is often tied to identity, making it difficult to accept personal fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Examples include individuals who believe their body defies physics regarding weight loss, or that their marriage is "special" and communication frameworks won't apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### Potential for Transformation
Interestingly, the speaker finds Negative Active people have the highest potential to jump directly to Positive Active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. If their active energy can be redirected from proving something wrong to proving it right, they can become "absolute animals" and "brand champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Stories include a gym owner who transformed his business after shifting from negative active to positive active, and a client named Autumn who lost weight after deciding she wanted to be "thin" more than she wanted to be "right" about her unique metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, demonstrating [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | overcoming societal and personal challenges to achieve success]].

## The Philosophy of "Do, Not Try"

The speaker emphasizes the difference between "trying to succeed" and "succeeding." Like Morpheus telling Neo "Stop trying to hit me and hit me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, the point is to engage in the action of winning rather than merely going through the motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Yoda's quote, "There is no try, there is only do or do not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, reinforces this. "Try" allows for the possibility of failure; true commitment to winning eliminates that possibility because success becomes an inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Bottom-Up Approach: The Role of Skills and Building a Bridge

Unequal outcomes in educational processes are often predicted by the number of skills someone has *before* entering the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### The "Last Brick" Phenomenon
People often attribute all success to the most recent program or "last brick" in building a bridge to an outcome, overlooking previous foundational learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Just as algebra builds on simple addition, advanced business concepts build on prior skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Success with an advanced teacher is possible because of the basic skills taught by a previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### Meta-Skills and Foundational Education
The more skills and "meta-skills" (e.g., learning how to learn, critical thinking) an individual possesses, the more successful they are likely to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This is because a higher skill set allows individuals to bridge gaps where instructions are vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Education often assumes a baseline of knowledge; if an individual lacks a remedial foundational skill (like literacy), a program "won't work" for them, but the fault lies in their own prerequisite skills, not the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_socioeconomic_background_in_education_choices | role of socioeconomic background in education choices]] and access to foundational learning.

## Learning from All Experiences: Inversion Thinking

Even in the most "dog shit" experiences, there is always something to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. By using "inversion thinking"—identifying what made an experience horrible and doing the exact opposite—one can still gain value and "ROI" from every experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This ensures a "no-fail situation" as a student, as you learn either what to do or what not to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Conclusion: Champions Create Success

Champions achieve [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | success]] regardless of conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. They do not blame the education system, teachers, or vendors. Instead, they "just win no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This is exemplified by athletes like Tom Brady, who can change teams and still lead to championships by forcing winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

The speaker's personal approach involves:
1.  **Desire to be Number One**: A strong drive to be the best student in any learning situation, ensuring personal growth regardless of teaching quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
2.  **Replicate Before Iterate**: First, meticulously follow proven steps to achieve the same results, understand *why* they work, and then seek ways to improve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Trying to innovate before understanding the basics (iterating before replicating) often leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to prove to yourself that you can win no matter what, rather than sacrificing your own success to prove a teacher or system is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. This reinforces [[self_respect_and_personal_development | self-respect and personal development]] through a relentless pursuit of victory.

From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The concept of an "anti-routine" focuses on stopping activities rather than adding new ones to achieve significant productivity gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. This approach helped Alex Hormozi go from near bankruptcy to earning over seven figures a month by age 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Instead of asking what successful people *do*, the more impactful question is what they *don't do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Often, champions achieve success not because they possess something others don't, but because they lack something others have, such as an "off switch" that allows them to "just keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Therefore, the key to maximizing [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | productivity]] is to eliminate actions that hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Mindset Shift: The Season of No

The fundamental change required is shifting from a mindset of adding more tasks to a routine to actively [[eliminating_nonessential_tasks_for_efficiency | stopping current activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This reveals "all that remains is the work to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Prioritization Means Saying No
The term "priorities" implies that two things cannot be equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. If time is split equally between two tasks, neither can truly be considered a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Many people struggle with [[the_importance_of_prioritization_in_business | prioritization]] because they "cannot say no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a> "The theme of this entire video is the word no."

To truly prioritize something, it means saying "no" to everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This "season of no" is not necessarily permanent, but a temporary strategy for outsized [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | productivity]] returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Communication and Obligation
When people communicate, text, or email, there's an implied request for a reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. However, having the time to reply does not equate to an obligation to reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. If faced with 500,000 texts, it becomes physically impossible to reply to all, making it clear that the obligation to reply never existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. A significant part of the "anti-routine" involved intentionally stopping replying to people, which was personally challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Socializing vs. Problem Solving
Many events, masterminds, and coaching programs primarily serve social needs rather than addressing specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Once necessary information is acquired, the focus must shift entirely to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Continued attendance becomes counterproductive if the task is simply to "do" what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

## Tactics for Implementing "No"

The following tactics were implemented to eliminate distractions and focus solely on essential work:

*   **Changed Phone Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>: The old number was given to an assistant, and a new number was acquired. Communication was initiated only with those deemed necessary, rather than being reactive to everyone who had the old number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This dramatically increased available time, creating "blank space" in the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **Stopped Attending Events** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>: Recognizing the need for execution over more information, attendance at masterminds and other events ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **No Meetings 4 AM - Noon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>: The first eight hours of each day were dedicated to completely uninterrupted work on the top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This is critical for early-stage growth when there isn't enough team leverage to delegate tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. [[the_importance_of_focus_and_avoiding_distractions | Eliminating distractions]] during this time was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>: Weekends were treated the same as weekdays, maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. This ensures the 4 AM to noon work block is consistently protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Effective Dose for Health** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>: Workouts were reduced to twice a week, which was the minimum necessary for maintenance, rather than aiming for progress on multiple fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This allocates "growth juju" to the highest priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Fasting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>: Fasting one or two days a week eliminated interruptions from meal preparation, eating, and cleaning, allowing for more uninterrupted work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Deleted Social Media from Phone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>: Social media apps were removed from the phone, as most posting functions could be done from a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This tackled the issue of "ghost thumb" addiction and recovered 3-5 hours daily typically spent consuming social media, which is considered the "new age of watching television" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Reclaiming these hours significantly boosts [[personal_experience_with_productivity | productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

The [[the_importance_of_focus_and_saying_no | importance of focus and saying no]] is about identifying and eliminating the things that people are already doing that prevent them from reaching their goals, rather than seeking a "secret magic routine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. The "season of no" involves stopping these non-essential actions to achieve significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

This article explores various [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | training approaches]] and specific exercise variations, drawing insights from personal experience and observations.

## Unique Training Philosophy

A distinct approach to [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | training]] involves working out in reverse order of weakness, from the "worst" body part to the "best" body part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This method aims to warm up and load joints for subsequent exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Starting with Calves
For over 10 years, calves have been the starting point of every workout session due to being the weakest body part in terms of proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Significant growth was observed after doubling the volume and training calves in every workout session, rather than just twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
Starting a session with a low-investment movement like calf raises is underrated, as it's an easy way to begin without resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Full-Body Training
The preferred [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | training]] frequency is full-body workouts every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This approach is considered optimal for body composition and gaining the most muscle, while also allowing for supersets to eliminate the need for separate [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | cardio]] sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Experimentation and Goals

Early [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | training]] years, specifically in the 20s, involved extensive experimentation with different modalities:
- CrossFit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
- Bodyweight training for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
- Only swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
- Only kettlebells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
- Isometrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
This period of "absolute ignorance" involved trying various programs based on different sales letters and e-books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The ultimate goal was to achieve maximum muscle with the least amount of headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Exercise Variations and Techniques

Specific techniques and variations are used to enhance muscle engagement and effectiveness:

- **Seated Hamstring Curls**: Leaning forward and pushing the chest up during seated hamstring curls stretches the hamstring more and maintains tension throughout the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This leads to a "big stretch and big squeeze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
- **Toe Positioning for Hamstring Curls**: Pointing toes forward during hamstring curls increases the involvement of the calf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Variations include:
    - Starting with toes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
    - Moving to neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    - Using "limp" or "dangly" feet to take the calf out of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
- **Shoulder Training**: Primarily focusing on medial and rear deltoids, while not training the front deltoids, to address specific deficiencies and constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
- **Bicep Curls**: Moving forward on the machine by about two inches to achieve a fuller stretch and a more intense pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
- **Rep Strategy**: Aim for as many "perfect reps" as possible, then continue with "imperfect reps" to fully fatigue the muscle through different ranges of motion and increase total volume per set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## The Role of a Training Partner

Training with a partner is highly preferred, especially after years in the gym, as it helps maintain motivation and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. When training with someone, individuals tend to:
- Rest less because the partner's set acts as a timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
- Train harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>
- Train longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>
- Do more sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
- Utilize better form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

There are two types of [[personal_training_experiences | training sessions]]:
1.  **Intense sessions**: "Going in there to die and remove your own soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
2.  **Social sessions**: More relaxed, still getting a workout but without pushing to exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Learning from Others
A key "hack" for [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | bodybuilding]] and business is to learn from people who are far ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Significant improvements in physique often occur when receiving insights from those with decades of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This emphasizes the value of gaining lessons without the "scar" of personal trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Injury Rehabilitation and Warm-ups

When recovering from an injury, the strategy is to continue movement with very light weight on the machine where the injury occurred, gradually increasing the weight over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. This is likened to gymnasts getting back on the pommel horse immediately after a fall to prevent psychological barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.

For warm-ups, the focus is on raising core body temperature rather than performing specific movements, as evidence on stretching for injury prevention is mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This is another reason for starting with calves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.

## Genetic Potential and Maintenance

Individuals can have different genetic potentials for muscle growth:
- Some are naturally large and muscular with low potential for *further* growth but have a high baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
- Others are genetically small but have huge growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

At a certain point in [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | training]], the goal shifts from gaining more muscle to stimulating existing muscle to maintain it and avoid injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Weaknesses are prioritized by moving them up in the workout routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

## [[Daily routine and productivity strategies | Daily Routines]] and Discipline

The concept of discipline is re-framed: truly "disciplined" people are those who find ways to make enjoyable activities part of their routine, rather than forcing themselves through miserable tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For example, engaging in activities like pickleball for 90 minutes can burn 1,000 calories without feeling like a chore, unlike traditional [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | cardio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The key is to "find your pickleball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

For productivity, the strategy is to do the most important task first, which currently is writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This means scheduling non-priority activities, like meetings, for later in the day (e.g., after noon or 1 PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.# Training Routines and Exercise Variations

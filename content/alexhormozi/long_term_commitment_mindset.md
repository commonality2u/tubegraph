Achieving significant success often requires a [[longterm_focus_and_commitment_in_entrepreneurship | long-term focus and commitment]] rather than expecting immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many aspiring creators and entrepreneurs anticipate rapid growth, such as a podcast "blowing up" in 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, the reality is that substantial achievements are built over years of consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Beyond Overnight Success

The perception of "overnight success" often overlooks years of dedicated work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For instance, a podcast launched in 2017 took five and a half to six years to reach the top 10 in its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. During this period, the creator consistently produced one to three podcasts every week for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The initial phase of any endeavor, particularly in content creation, is a learning process:
*   **Finding your voice** The first year is often spent discovering how you communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Developing skills** This includes learning how to teach, entertain, present, and speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Evolving content** The subject matter itself can evolve as you learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For example, a podcast might start focused on a niche topic like running a gym, then broaden to general marketing, sales, and business as expertise develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Both the subject matter and delivery skill improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Power of Process Over Outcome

A key shift in [[mindset_changes_for_achieving_financial_goals | mindset changes for achieving financial goals]] involves focusing on the process and activities rather than solely on the outcome or immediate monetary results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. An entrepreneur who initially focused on sales would slow down their efforts once money came in, leading to a cycle of scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This highlights a lack of [[understanding_the_impact_of_commitment_and_focus | understanding the impact of commitment and focus]].

*   **Consistency is key** True success comes from the trait of consistency – the ability to perform tasks repeatedly, even without immediate positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Independent of results** Maintain activities whether things are going exceptionally well or not yet yielding desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **The "doing" is the goal** Make the action itself the goal. If the action is making posts or reaching out, then completing those actions daily signifies success, regardless of the immediate external outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

> "The goal of the winner is to commit to the activities, the goal of the loser is to commit to the goal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

This perspective, inspired by "Atomic Habits," suggests that while everyone might share goals (e.g., being rich or having a six-pack), it's the unique activities performed that differentiate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. When you focus on the activities that generate wealth rather than just the million dollars, you gain control over your self-esteem, as it's tied to what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Cultivating Consistency

An example illustrates the power of sustained effort: a friend who wanted to build an online brand was advised to start posting valuable short-form content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. After consistently posting every day for six months, one video took off, then another, leading to significant monthly income from content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This success came after nine years of prior business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

This demonstrates the [[impact_of_longterm_investment | impact of Longterm Investment]] and the [[importance_of_financial_discipline_and_longterm_planning | importance of financial discipline and longterm planning]]. If you can [[the_importance_of_commitment_and_setting_priorities | commit to the actions]], behaviors, and traits that foster growth, you will become the kind of person capable of sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This trait, in turn, can remove money as a constraint in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Shifting Perspective: Thinking in Decades

Instead of thinking in days or 90-day sprints, adopt a "thinking in decades" approach to goal setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This long-term outlook helps maintain motivation and focus.

*   **Long-term commitment** When discussing a YouTube channel, a commitment to a 5-to-10-year horizon was expressed, stating, "I'm in for a decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This perspective was unique among clients who typically sought immediate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Reduced emotional volatility** This [[entrepreneurship_and_business_growth_mindset | entrepreneurship and business growth mindset]] of long-term thinking helps decrease emotional ups and downs in business, as the focus is not on short-term gains but on sustained progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

By putting your "game playing life" into things you can control—your actions and consistency—rather than uncontrollable outcomes, you build resilience and achieve lasting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This aligns with [[the_role_of_longterm_investment in personal growth | the role of longterm investment in personal growth]].

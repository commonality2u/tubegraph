From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The speaker shares frameworks and lessons learned from building four businesses that each surpassed $10 million in revenue, aiming to help others achieve similar levels of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These insights come from various mistakes and successes across different ventures, ultimately leading to a portfolio company, Acquisition.com.

## Case Study: Gym Launch

Gym Launch was the first major company built, operating as a licensing business for gym owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The model involved licensing a proven system to gym owners, which helped them increase their profits by an average of $100,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. At its peak, the business was valued at $150 million before being sold for $46.2 million to American Pacific Group, a private equity firm, after being impacted by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Initial Customer Acquisition
The first ten Gym Launch customers were acquired through a labor-intensive process:
1.  A virtual assistant scraped CrossFit's database for emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Emails were uploaded to Facebook for a lookalike audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  A webinar was marketed, but no one watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  Despite 80 opt-in leads, none bought or scheduled a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
5.  Emails were manually looked up, and individuals were friended and messaged on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
6.  A few were convinced to pay $500 for the speaker to fly to their gym and perform a turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | Scalable Licensing Model]]
The licensing version of the model provided significant [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | scale]] with virtually 100% margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Sales rapidly grew from $120,000 in the first month to $300,000, then high hundreds of thousands, reaching $1 million by the fourth month simply by selling more units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Product Excellence and Problem Solving
A core aspect of Gym Launch's success was its exceptional product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The team would identify common problems faced by gym owners (e.g., churn, margin issues, lead close rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. They would:
1.  Formulate a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
2.  Survey the community to find top performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
3.  Invite 20 top performers to a call to identify common, impactful practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  Focus on the "few things" that all successful people were doing, ensuring the solutions had a demonstrated long-term benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!INFO] Importance of Product
> If customers love your product, the word-of-mouth marketing it generates compounds significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This "inch between good and great" is where immense returns are found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Client-Financed Acquisition
A key [[effective_business_frameworks  for_growth | framework]] used across all the speaker's businesses is client-financed acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This means customers finance the acquisition of the next customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
The strategy eliminates capital as a constraint if the first sale generates enough profit to cover:
*   Cost to acquire the first customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Cost to fulfill the first customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Cost to acquire the *next* customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Cost to fulfill the *next* customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This aggressive acquisition allowed Gym Launch to "outspend" competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Reasons for Success
1.  **Timing & Arbitrage:** Identified an arbitrage opportunity on Facebook ads before others did, creating a turnkey system to monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Facebook ads in 2013 were "the wild west," allowing highly effective, low-cost marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
2.  **Immediate Value:** The average gym gained an additional $30,000 cash in their first 30 days, which was significant given the average gym owner only made $36,000 profit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This created an organic marketing effect where customers became advocates.

> [!CAUTION] Over-hiring
> One mistake was over-hiring for support. An inexperienced director promoted from the front lines hired 35 reps when only 5 were needed, leading to 30 layoffs and negative Glassdoor reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Case Study: Prestige Labs

Prestige Labs was a sister company to Gym Launch, built on an affiliate base acquired through the existing gym network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The first month of full operation generated $1.7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Business Model
The speaker realized the profit potential in supplements after seeing a client spend $700 on retail products that could have been sourced for $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The model was designed so that gym owners could sell supplements to cover their customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **No Added Fulfillment for Gyms:** Gyms simply swiped credit cards, and Prestige Labs centrally managed direct-to-consumer shipping, eliminating additional delivery burden for the gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Exclusive Brand:** The brand was created exclusively for gym owners, with higher pricing on the main site to incentivize gym sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue:** Products were sold as recurring subscriptions, providing gym owners with multiple recurring revenue streams per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Staged Rollout:** The initial rollout involved 10 locations, followed by 20-30 in subsequent months, before a big launch to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Investment & Difficulties
Starting Prestige Labs cost $4 million, with $1 million allocated to proprietary tech development (a point-of-sale system for gyms) and $3 million for product inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Difficulties included:
*   **Supply Chain:** Running out of a single ingredient could halt sales of an entire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Legal Challenges:** Predatory law firms buying products to test for discrepancies or suing based on patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Customer Stickiness:** Consumers often don't stick with fitness products long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Focus
> The biggest lesson from Prestige Labs was that starting it might have been a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Allocating more time to improving Gym Launch would have made it bigger, rather than becoming CEO of two companies simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Case Study: Use Allen (Scheduling Software)

Use Allen, still operational today, was developed to automate scheduling for small businesses, leveraging AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. It aggregates data to predictably show optimal days, times, and follow-up sequences for appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The business was compensated based on show-up rates, aligning incentives with customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Problem Solving
Originally designed for gym owners, it addressed the issue of low lead conversion rates (9% manually vs. nearly 20% with automation) while significantly reducing costs compared to hiring a front desk person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This dramatically improved lead throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### [[leveraging_business_operations_and_managing_growth | Leveraging Distribution & Agencies]]
Initial customers came from the existing Gym Launch distribution base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The breakthrough came from realizing the need to target agencies rather than individual small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Agencies already had clients needing lead generation, adding a layer of [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | leverage]] (one agency could have 50 small business owners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Further [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | leverage]] was gained by doing webinars with agency audiences, allowing one pitch to acquire a thousand customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Two such pitches led to $1.7 million per month in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

The business was eventually sold, 75% to a strategic buyer, in an all-stock deal after achieving $12 million in trailing 12-month revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Lessons Learned
1.  **In-House CTO for Software:** External development shops were deemed "as close to a complete scam" for building a software company, emphasizing the need for an in-house CTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Early Pricing Surveys:** Running pricing surveys early can unlock significant pricing power (e.g., 4x for Allen) by exploring different charging models (usage-based, recurring, APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
3.  **Aligned Incentives:** Having incentives aligned with customers and stakeholders (small business owner, agency owner, and the software company all wanted people to show up) leads to tremendous scale and more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
4.  **Throughput on Appointments:** Maximizing availability (days, hours, time increments) for scheduling sales calls or in-person appointments dramatically increases throughput (50-200% improvement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. "Small business owners stay small" often due to limited availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Case Study: Acquisition.com (Portfolio Company)

Acquisition.com is the fourth business, now overseeing a portfolio of companies generating over $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. It invests in businesses, aiming to help them grow from $3 million to $10 million and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Core Philosophy & Model
The speaker started with the question, "What can I do forever?" and built backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This led to a capital company vehicle with high [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

*   **Inbound & Personal Brand:** Acquisition.com is unique in being built on a personal brand and inbound content, which attracts aligned individuals and potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. While slower than transactional businesses, it provides continuous learning by exposure to diverse businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Cross-Pollination of Ideas:** Co-owning various businesses allows for learning about different industries (e.g., solar, mortgage sales) and cross-pollinating successful ideas for outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | Key Strategies for Growth]]
1.  **[[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | Top-Down Hiring]]:** Unlike previous ventures, Acquisition.com hired from the top down, delegating to highly competent individuals who were "better than us at their respective things" (e.g., Director of Sales, Marketing, IT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This requires being well-capitalized, as it means incurring financial debt to avoid management, cultural, or technical debt later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
2.  **Recruiting Talent as Core Competency:** The business prioritizes recruiting talent, a strength due to significant inbound interest and the "prestige" of being a private equity firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
3.  **Training & Support:** A dedicated holdco team trains new hires on their business practices, ensuring they "get it right the first time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Portfolio companies also have access to directors at the holding company for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

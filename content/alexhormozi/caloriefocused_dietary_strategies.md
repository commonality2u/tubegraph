A speaker, who originated from the fitness world, shared his long-standing approach to [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | diet and nutrition]] during a mastermind meeting with entrepreneurs [00:00:00]. He observed that many entrepreneurs adhere to "weird shticks" about food, exercise, hydration, and "biohacking" [00:00:30], which he views as "complete make believe" and a "farce" [00:00:44]. While others at the event were strictly following diets like keto or intermittent fasting [00:00:59], he maintained his physique while openly consuming Twizzlers, cookies, and ice cream [00:01:05].

His personal [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting and nutrition strategy]], which he has followed for almost 20 years, allows for daily consumption of ice cream, alcohol, and cookies while maintaining a six-pack since his early teens [00:01:46]. He later presented this method, leading to several attendees successfully getting in shape [00:01:36].

## Demystifying Diets: It's About Calories

The core insight is that nearly all [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | diets]], such as keto, low-fat, portion control, or intermittent fasting, fundamentally achieve their results by reducing overall caloric intake [00:04:08].
*   **Keto**: Eliminates carbs, leading to one-third fewer calories [00:04:10].
*   **Low-Fat**: Eliminates fat, resulting in one-third fewer calories [00:04:26].
*   **Portion Control**: Reduces equal amounts of all macronutrients, leading to fewer overall calories [00:04:35].
*   **Intermittent Fasting**: Reduces meal frequency, resulting in fewer calories consumed daily [00:04:43].

This highlights a [[common_misconceptions_about_diets | common misconception]]: people who believe a diet "didn't work" often inadvertently increase calories elsewhere. For example, a "failed" keto diet might involve excessive intake of butter or ribeye steaks, adding more calories than initially cut out [00:05:42].

## The Three Core Principles

For 99% of people, only three things matter for achieving desired body composition:
1.  How many calories you need to eat [00:06:14].
2.  How many grams of protein you need [00:06:14].
3.  How much volume (workout) you need to do [00:06:26].

This article focuses on the first two, as they are crucial for [[caloric_intake_and_protein_calculation | caloric intake and protein calculation]].

### 1. Calculating Your Calorie Goal

Your daily caloric intake is determined by your body weight and your specific goal (e.g., maintenance, weight loss, weight gain) [00:06:38].

*   **Formula**: Body Weight (lbs) × Goal Multiplier (between 7 and 21) [00:06:38]
*   **Example for 200lb individual**:
    *   **Maintenance (high side)**: 200 lbs × 15 = 3,000 calories/day [00:06:42]
    *   **Fast Weight Loss**: 200 lbs × 10 = 2,000 calories/day [00:06:56]
    *   **Moderate Weight Loss**: 200 lbs × 11 = 2,200 calories/day [00:10:16]

The exact calculation isn't as important as being able to adjust. If you're not losing weight at your desired rate, simply decrease your caloric intake [00:07:21].

### 2. Calculating Your Protein Goal

Protein intake is vital and allows for [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexible eating and understanding body type]] while maintaining muscle [00:07:56].

*   **Formula**: Body Weight (lbs) × 1 gram of protein [00:08:36]
*   **Example for 200lb individual**: 200 lbs = 200 grams of protein per day [00:08:43]

A key "life hack" for protein measurement: 100 grams of protein is roughly equivalent to one pound of lean meat [00:08:50]. Therefore, a 200lb person would aim for two pounds of lean meat per day [00:08:57].

[[highprotein_recipes | Lean protein sources]] include:
*   Shrimp [00:09:18]
*   Tilapia [00:09:19]
*   Tenderloin [00:09:29]
*   Flank steak [00:09:31]
*   Top round [00:09:36]
*   Top sirloin [00:09:38]
*   Chicken breasts [00:09:43]

## The Flexible Eating Strategy

This approach integrates caloric and protein goals to allow for dietary freedom.

1.  **Determine Daily Calorie Goal**: Based on your body weight and target (e.g., 2,200 calories for 200lb moderate weight loss) [00:10:12].
2.  **Determine Daily Protein Goal**: Based on your body weight (e.g., 200 grams for 200lb) [00:10:23]. This means approximately 2 pounds of lean meat [00:10:30].
3.  **Calculate Calories from Protein**: While protein contains ~4 calories per gram, for a simple calculation that accounts for some fat in lean meat, multiply protein grams by 5 [00:10:38].
    *   Example: 200 grams protein × 5 calories/gram = 1,000 calories from protein [00:11:08].
4.  **Determine Remaining "Flexible" Calories**: Subtract protein calories from your total calorie goal.
    *   Example: 2,200 total calories - 1,000 protein calories = 1,200 calories remaining [00:11:18].

These remaining calories can be filled with "whatever the hell you want" [00:11:25]. The key is to prioritize protein intake first, then consume other foods to reach your total calorie limit [00:11:56]. This allows for daily indulgences like ice cream, cookies, and Twizzlers [00:11:38].

### Benefits of This Approach

*   **Sustainability**: The ability to eat desired foods means it can be maintained "forever" [00:08:16].
*   **No "Falling Off"**: Since nothing is forbidden, there are no "cheat days" or feelings of guilt [00:13:02].
*   **Reduced Obsession**: When foods like ice cream are eaten regularly, they stop being "special," reducing compulsive eating [00:13:23].
*   **Adaptability**: The same base protein intake protects muscle, and the remaining calories can be adjusted up or down for weight gain or loss [00:13:54].

This straightforward method contrasts with the complex and often misleading "biohacking" and supplement trends seen in the entrepreneurial world [00:14:40]. The speaker aims for people to be "shredded and jacked" while being able to "#neverskipdessert" [00:15:21].

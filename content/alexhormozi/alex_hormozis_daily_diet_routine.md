Alex Hormozi maintains a consistent physique, including a six-pack, despite eating dessert "virtually every night for 20 years" and never skipping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach to [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting and nutrition]] isn't based on scientific research but rather on what has consistently worked for him and others who have adopted his methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He has experimented with various [[unconventional_diet_explanation | diets]] including keto, high carb, low carb, high fat, intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting, and carnivore-style eating, but for the last 10 years, he has eaten "pretty much the exact same way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This allows him to attend business dinners and have drinks while maintaining his physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Core Principles

The foundation of Hormozi's [[maintaining_fitness_with_simple_nutrition | nutrition strategy]] is to first determine your goal: whether you are trying to get bigger or smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Target Calories

To find your daily caloric intake, multiply your body weight by a coefficient ranging from 7 to 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These coefficients dictate your goal:
*   **7-9:** Extreme Weight Loss
*   **10-12:** Moderate Weight Loss
*   **13-15:** Maintenance
*   **16-18:** Moderate Weight Gain
*   **19-21:** Extreme Weight Gain
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

*   **Example Calculation (Moderate Cut):**
    *   For a 200 lb individual aiming for a moderate cut, he uses a coefficient of 10 for easy math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   200 lbs * 10 = 2,000 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Adjustability:** This calculation is a starting point. If you lose too much weight too fast, you can adjust your coefficient (e.g., from 10 to 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Daily activity or physical jobs do not significantly change this initial calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Step 2: Determine Your Protein Intake

Multiply your body weight by one to find your protein target in grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Example:** A 200 lb person would aim for 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Protein Sources:** Lean meat, white fish, ground turkey breast (96/4), ground beef, and shrimp are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Conversion:** Approximately one pound of lean meat equals 100 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. So, 200 grams of protein would be roughly two pounds of meat if it were your exclusive protein source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Personal Preference:** Hormozi often consumes more than 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight because it fills him up and makes him "feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Step 3: Allocate Your Flexible Calories

Once you have determined your total daily calories and protein grams, calculate the caloric value of your protein intake and subtract it from your total daily calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Example (2000 calorie cut, 200g protein):**
    *   If 2 pounds of turkey (200g protein) equates to 1120 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   2000 total calories - 1120 protein calories = 880 calories remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **The Magic:** The remaining calories are "flexible," meaning you can spend them on "whatever you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This allows for:
    *   Business dinners and drinks (e.g., two cocktails at 150 calories each and a 500-calorie meal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   An entire pint of ice cream (around 880 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Two 400-calorie cookies for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** The high protein intake keeps you full, preventing overeating on less nutritious foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This strategy allows for [[balancing_dessert_and_fitness | balancing dessert and fitness]].

## Alex Hormozi's Personal Daily Routine (Maintenance Example)

While he uses a cut example for explanation, Hormozi typically maintains his weight, operating at a higher caloric intake (e.g., 200 lbs * 15 = 3000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This gives him an extra 1000 calories compared to the cut example, allowing for even more flexibility in his "flex meal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

His [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | daily routine]] for meals is very consistent:

*   **Breakfast:**
    *   A 200-calorie protein bar (like a Quest Bar when traveling) with 20g of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   A protein shake with 30g of protein and 160 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   **Total Breakfast:** 360 calories, 50g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Lunch:**
    *   One pound of turkey (560 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   Half a cup of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   **Total by Lunch:** 1140 calories, 150g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Dinner ("Flex Meal"):**
    *   He typically eats another pound of protein at dinner, but this is optional if the protein target is already met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   The remaining calories are for "whatever you want," as long as it aligns with the total calorie target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   The high protein content ensures satiety, preventing cravings for excessive junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Greens:** Hormozi takes a multivitamin instead of consuming greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This [[impact_of_daily_routines_on_personal_growth | consistent daily routine]] has yielded significant results for others, with some reporting losing 50 lbs using this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Hormozi notes that his training as an entrepreneur is different from that of a professional bodybuilder, strongman, powerlifter, or Olympic lifter, and he may discuss his [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | workout strategies]] in a separate video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

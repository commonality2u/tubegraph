From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

Achieving financial success often involves navigating the influence of one's social circle, which can either support or hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. The journey out of poverty, in particular, requires a re-evaluation of relationships and a willingness to make difficult choices for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Overcoming External Validation and Judgment

A significant obstacle on the path to [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | financial success]] is the need to confront external judgments and the desire for social approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The speaker recounts experiences of being patronized after taking a minimum wage job following a white-collar career, highlighting the difficulty of humbling oneself in the face of others' perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Instead of reacting with anger or trying to "humiliate them back," the speaker learned to prioritize their financial goals over immediate emotional gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This developed a "skin" necessary to pay rent and pursue objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The concept of being "right or rich" is central to this mindset shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Holding onto blame for past circumstances or external factors, even if factually correct, gives power away and prevents progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Embracing the "victim frame" or the "powerless frame" might offer short-term comfort and the satisfaction of being "right" when things don't work out, but it guarantees long-term failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## The Role of Friends and Social Circles

The impact of friendships on personal growth and [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | success]] is profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. The speaker suggests evaluating friends based on whether they "increase or decrease the possibility of failure" with one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. If a friend decreases the possibility of success, it might be necessary to "get rid of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

[[the_challenges_of_changing_social_circles_for_personal_development | This can be a difficult decision]], as many people maintain friendships out of habit rather than intentional alignment with their aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. Friends who are not pursuing their own goals or who are content with their current state might become "negative experience points" by slowing one down or weakening their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

### Social Obligations vs. Social Consequences
A key insight is that there are "no social obligations, only social consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. If someone feels obligated to attend an event they don't want to, the "punishment" for not going is often that they won't be invited again in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. This can be seen as a "win-win," saving time in the present and future for productive pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

By thinking about "second and third order outcomes," individuals can recognize that offending or "breaking up" with friends often brings them closer to their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

> "If you don't like their life, don't listen to what they say. Don't take their advice if you don't like what you see." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>

This implies a need to actively choose who influences one's beliefs and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

### The Lonely Middle Path
The speaker describes a "lonely" period where one is not yet successful enough for a new tier of friends but has become too different from their old social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This loneliness, however, provides "time," which is the most valuable asset for someone starting with little money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This time can be used to acquire skills, which are then traded for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## Practical Steps to Changing Your Financial Trajectory

1.  **Own Your Situation**: The foundational step is to accept that your current circumstances are "my fault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This isn't about self-blame but about reclaiming power. As long as blame is cast elsewhere, power is also cast away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This is the base layer upon which all other [[mindset_changes_for_achieving_financial_goals | success]] is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

    > "You cannot both desire to get better and also maintain blame. You have to pick." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>

2.  **Utilize What You Have**: Rather than waiting for ideal circumstances or resources, use what is available, even if it's just "anger, shame, or pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. The speaker used "sheer anger" and the desire to prove "People Back Home" wrong as a powerful motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

3.  **Invest in Skills**: Wealthy individuals focus on acquiring skills and continually reinvesting to gain more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This means taking any excess income and spending it on learning and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
    *   **Experience Points**: Failed experiments or attempts are not losses but "experience points" that contribute to leveling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
    *   **Selling**: Money is made by providing value to others voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This can involve selling products (at a margin for convenience) or selling skills/outcomes (expertise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. Affiliate programs are a good starting point for learning sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

4.  **Embrace Pain for Future Gain**: Poor individuals often delay pain by prioritizing pleasure today, leading to greater pain tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The path to [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | success]] involves "eating the glass" â€“ enduring significant discomfort and effort in the present to "get ahead" and "take as much of the pain from tomorrow as you can today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

    > "Change happens when the pain of staying the same is less than the pain of change." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>

    This involves "Future Pacing" by actively imagining the negative consequences of inaction to make the present discomfort of change more tolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

The journey to [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | financial success]] is a demanding one, requiring extreme effort and a willingness to make social sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. By taking ownership, leveraging available resources, continuously learning, and accepting short-term pain for long-term gain, individuals can navigate the challenges posed by their social environment and achieve their financial aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

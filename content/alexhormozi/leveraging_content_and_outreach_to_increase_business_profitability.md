Achieving business growth and profitability fundamentally relies on effective advertising and lead generation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These strategies are universally applicable across diverse sectors, including real estate, healthcare, auto, insurance, local businesses, home services, financial services, consumer services, software, e-learning, online businesses, and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The effectiveness of these methods is proven by practical application in various portfolio companies, demonstrating their real-world impact rather than being theoretical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Indispensable Role of Advertising
For any business to grow, it is essential that potential customers are aware of its existence and offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Without visibility, purchases are impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A core principle of business growth states that "all else being equal, when you double your leads, you double your business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This highlights the direct correlation between lead generation and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Advertising is critical because if no one knows about your products, no one buys them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. More importantly, the ability to consistently generate leads provides "endless chances to get it right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This skill is foundational, as it ensures a continuous flow of potential customers, allowing for adaptation and improvement even with initial imperfections in product or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Leads represent individuals with a problem to solve and the financial capacity to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Advertising is the process of making known, letting strangers discover your offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## The Core Four Advertising Methods
There are four primary ways to let others know about your offerings, collectively known as the "Core Four" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

### 1. Warm Outreach
Warm outreach involves directly contacting individuals who already know you on a one-to-one basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **How it was learned**: The speaker started their first business by reaching out to 101 friends, asking if they knew anyone interested in fitness, leading to six initial clients for a non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. These individuals later became direct-paying customers, allowing the transition to a real business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This method saved the speaker from an undesirable career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Application for the book launch**: It was used by privately contacting friends and inviting them to the book launch event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Current uses**: Effective for securing the first five customers, subsequent customers, or launching new products within a company division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This can be done via email, phone calls, direct messages, physical mail, voicemails, or even carrier pigeons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content
This method involves sharing content with people who know you, but on a one-to-many scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **How it was learned**: After exhausting warm outreach, the speaker created their first public advertisement post in April 2013 on Facebook, detailing their "free personal training project" and linking to a website with client transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. By consistently posting fitness content and testimonials, and messaging those who interacted, the speaker secured 20 new clients at $200/month, generating $4,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This enabled financial stability and further learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Application for the book launch**: Content was pre-recorded months in advance, following a rigorous calendar of 17 shorts, 6 long-form videos, and 2200 total posts across Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. A key lesson was to maintain regular content while adding promotional posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This generated over 400 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> and 194,000 registrations using a "hook, retain, reward" content framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This was equivalent to $3 million a month in free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Current uses**: Applicable on platforms like YouTube, podcasts, SiriusXM Radio, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. It's scalable from one post to 250 posts per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### 3. Running Paid Ads
Paid advertising involves letting strangers know about your offerings on a one-to-many scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **How it was learned**: After observing a gym owner using Groupon, the speaker tried to replicate the model for their own gym but failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. A marketing seminar introduced them to Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. After a partnership dissolved, leaving the speaker with no clients and limited savings, they ran a simple, text-only Facebook ad offering a free six-week challenge in exchange for before-and-after pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This ad secured 29 members before the gym even opened, generating just enough cash to cover the first month's rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Learning paid ads allowed the speaker to survive and grow their business independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Application for the book launch**: Paid ads were run on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Simple ads were created using the "what, who, when" framework from the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This campaign spent $275,000 and generated 137,000 leads at a cost of about $2 per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, pushing traffic to a simple landing page with a 55% opt-in rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Current uses**: Paid ads are the fastest way to acquire leads, especially for those with no existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. They work even with small budgets (a few dollars a day) and are highly scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The speaker's portfolio companies spend over $1 million per week on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

### 4. Cold Outreach
Cold outreach involves privately contacting people who don't know you on a one-to-one basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **How it was learned**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, when 30% of gyms permanently closed, the speaker's gym licensing company faced collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. A former job applicant, who had worked at a gym software company doing $10 million/month entirely through outbound sales, was hired to build an outbound machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. This cold outreach initiative, starting with zero sales in the first month, grew to 30 sales and $480,000 in monthly recurring revenue by May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Cold outreach saved the company during its hardest time and made it a sellable entity, with outbound sales eventually accounting for over 50% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Application for the book launch**: Cold outreach was used to secure podcast appearances to promote the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **Current uses**: This can involve knocking on doors, sending DMs, making calls, or leaving voicemails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Platforms include SMS, DMs, emails, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and physical mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. It works with a tiny budget, primarily requiring time, contact methods, and knowing what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. It's scalable through automation and other people's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. A key advantage is the ability to target specific, highly qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. The speaker's portfolio companies perform over 15,000 reach-outs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

## Leveraging Other People to Get Leads
While individuals can utilize the Core Four methods, the most efficient way to advertise is to have others do it on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. These "Lead Getters" include customers, employees, agencies, and affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This approach shifts from high work/low leads/lowest leverage to low work/high leads/highest leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>, enabling massive scale without personal time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### 1. Customers (Referrals)
Customers can generate more customers, often through warm outreach on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The speaker's previous book, "100 Million Dollar Offers," sold 467,000 copies with zero paid ads, primarily through customer referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This demonstrates the power of organic word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

### 2. Employees
Employees can execute the Core Four methods on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. For the book launch, the "Mosey Media" team created 143 book-specific posts and over 2200 pieces of content in six weeks, showing how internal teams drive content-based lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### 3. Agencies
Agencies can be hired to run ads, post content, or conduct outreach on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. For the book launch, an agency was responsible for clicking the buttons and running the paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

### 4. Affiliates
[[leveraging_affiliates_to_grow_a_business | Affiliates]] are independent businesses that promote your products to their audience, often in exchange for compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. They use their own advertising methods to reach their engaged leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. The power of affiliates lies in their ability to scale revenue significantly with the same amount of work, as they leverage their own audiences and advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. For the book event, 23,722 affiliates promoted it through content, ads, and email lists, bringing in over 104,361 registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The speaker's supplement company generated $1.7 million per month in sales with zero paid ads, using 100 affiliates to handle advertising and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.

## The 100 Million Dollar Lead System

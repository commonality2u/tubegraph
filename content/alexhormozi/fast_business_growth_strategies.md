Alex Hormozi, who founded and sold three companies that experienced rapid growth, shares key [[key_business_strategies_for_growth | strategies]] that allowed his businesses to scale significantly within their first year: Gym Launch to over $2 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, Prestige Labs to $1.5 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, and OSLAN to $1.2 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These "growth levers" are applicable for any business seeking to achieve similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Overcoming Obscurity: Nobody Knows You Exist
The first problem most businesses under $1 million in revenue face is that "nobody knows you exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The initial four hours of every workday should be dedicated to moving from obscurity to awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

This can be achieved through the "Core Four" methods:
*   **Outreach:** Cold or warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Content Creation:** Making more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Running Ads:** Paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The key is to pick one method and go "all in," dedicating the first four hours of each day to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Advertising as a "Boom"
Advertising is considered a "boom," a term referring to a "business order of magnitude change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. While other business activities like increasing close rates or conversion rates are optimizations that are capped at 100% improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>, advertising can "100x the amount of people who find out about your business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. Many small business owners fall into an "optimization mouse trap," focusing on marginal gains rather than massive lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Marketplace Misconception
> Most people overestimate their market share and underestimate the actual size of their marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. Even if competitors are present, the vast majority of potential customers still don't know you exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. For example, a gym owner needing 200 members in a city of 1 million people still only needs 0.002% of the audience, even with 100 other gyms advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Shrinking Competition: Outgrow or Be Kind
Instead of trying to beat competitors, the goal should be to "shrink your competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This can be achieved in two ways:
1.  **Grow so big that no one can hear or see them:** Overwhelm the marketplace with your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This is like building the tallest building, making others appear smaller by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
2.  **Kill them with kindness:** Respond to hate or competition with grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Acknowledge flaws and congratulate competitors on their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This disarms critics and highlights your positive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Embrace Repetition
> Many small business owners mistakenly believe repetition is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. However, people often need to be "reminded more than they need to be taught" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Even after extensive advertising efforts, most people remain unaware of your brand or message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Become a "master of variety" in rephrasing the same message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Clear, Not Clever Communication
Effective communication is "clear not clever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Research suggests that politicians who speak at the lowest grade level tend to win elections because they lower the barrier to comprehension for a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Communication Rule
> Aim for your communication (landing pages, ad copy, content) to be understood by a third grader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Speaking simply helps experts understand more easily and beginners grasp concepts for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
>
> Richard Feynman's quote: "If you can explain it to a third grader, then you understand it. If you can't, you don't." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>

Use analogies suited to your audience:
*   **Narrow audience:** Use analogies specific to their industry (e.g., cars for mechanics, houses for realtors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.
*   **Broad audience:** Use universal human experiences (e.g., food, sleep, driving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

Applying this can significantly increase conversion rates; for example, simplifying email follow-ups led to a 50% increase in conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

## Proof Over Promise
"Proof is your single highest priority as a business owner or marketer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. A product with extensive positive reviews, even with a less flashy promise, will outperform one with a grand promise but minimal proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Prioritize Proof Generation
> Before launching a new product or entering a new space, seek beta users or work for free in exchange for testimonials, reviews, and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. This process refines the product and gathers compelling social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
>
> The most compelling way to advertise is to "show don't sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. The messenger's credibility is intrinsically linked to the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

## The Power of the Hook
The "hook" is paramount in advertising, more important than anything else, even proof, because people won't see the proof without a good hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Hook Formula
> The speaker's YouTube videos have a hook formula: **Proof, Promise, Plan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. Including these elements in content, ads, or outbound communication can significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
>
> Obsessing over the first impression (the first frame, first few seconds) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>. Simply trimming three seconds from a video's beginning, starting directly with the hook, increased views from 40,000 to 780,000 (a 19x improvement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>.

## More: The Mundane Path to Scale
[[scaling_businesses_quickly | Business Growth and Scaling Strategies]] often involve doing "more" of what is already working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>. While entrepreneurs love "new" ideas (shiny object syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>, the "boring answer is the mundane more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Cost of Change
> Changing something that works incurs the "cost of change" but does not guarantee the "benefit of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. Deviating from a high-converting control is often less effective than simply increasing volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
>
> **Examples of "More":**
> *   Outreach: From 100 to 200 reach-outs a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.
> *   Paid Ads: From $100 a day to $200 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>.
> *   Content: From posting once a day to twice a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

What appears as volatility in sales (e.g., one sale every few weeks) is typically a symptom of low volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>. Increasing daily activity to match annual successful volume can stabilize results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. High-performing businesses often do a thousand times more than smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Word of Mouth
While positive word-of-mouth is valuable, negative word-of-mouth is "significantly stronger and faster than positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. Disney found it takes 37 tragic moments to make up for one magic moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>, and a bad experience is told to many more people than a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>.

Rising cost per lead (CPL) despite stable cost per impression (CPM) indicates fewer people are responding, suggesting negative word-of-mouth is working against the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of the "proof over promise" principle, especially when starting out, to minimize negative experiences and collect positive feedback to build a valuable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.

## "Steal" from Yourself: The 70/20/10 Rule
When something works, keep using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>. You will get bored of a successful message or hook far before your customers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Effort Allocation Ratio (Sergey Brin & Larry Page)
>
> *   **70% "Carbon Copy":** Dedicate 70% of your effort to replicating what already works exactly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>. This applies across sales scripts, product development, and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>.
> *   **20% "Adjacent":** Allocate 20% to variations that are one degree removed from the core working element (e.g., same hook with a different background or phrasing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>.
> *   **10% "New":** Only 10% should be spent on entirely new, out-of-the-box ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.
>
> Most entrepreneurs invert this ratio, focusing too much on new, which is less likely to yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>.

## Understanding Buyers: Information Requirements
Instead of "emotional vs. logical buyers," consider a continuum of "high info buyers" (who require more information) and "low info buyers" (who require less) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>. The pool of low-information buyers is significantly smaller, and focusing only on them caps [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | business growth]] quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>. To scale, you must educate a higher percentage of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21:00">[39:21:00]</a>.

### Five Levels of Awareness (Eugene Schwarz)
Eugene Schwarz's "Breakthrough Advertising" outlines five levels of awareness customers move through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>:
1.  **Unaware:** No idea about anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a> (attract with broad curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>).
2.  **Problem Aware:** Aware of a pain point (attract by describing symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>).
3.  **Solution Aware:** Knows potential solutions and needs help selecting one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>.
4.  **Product Aware:** Knows your product and needs more micro-level information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>.
5.  **Most Aware:** Typically existing customers, where direct offers are most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] 70/30 Advertising Budget Split
> A conversation with Chris Davis (CMO of New Balance) revealed a strategic shift: instead of 70% direct offers and 30% brand/awareness, they flipped it to 70% high-level pairings (endorsements, storytelling) and 30% direct offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>. This change took 18 months to show a return but led to skyrocket sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:38:00">[42:44:00]</a>.
>
> This ratio of 3.5:1 (give to ask) is corroborated by media like TV commercials and Facebook Newsfeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:14:00">[43:14:00]</a>. Investing in "give-first" strategies, like free content and products, attracts high-information buyers and builds future demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>.

## Marketing Laws
1.  **State the facts and tell the truth:** This forces you to "change reality" by doing epic things worth talking about, rather than exaggerating underwhelming achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:00">[48:35:00]</a>. It's the best long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Show only what you can show and say what only you can say:** Every business has unique aspects if you "get narrow enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:00">[49:51:00]</a>. Identify what makes your business unique, even if others do it but don't highlight it (e.g., "It's toasted" cigarettes from Madmen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. The goal is to be "the best in a puddle," not necessarily the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>.

## The Importance of the List (Targeting)
Marketing effectiveness hinges on "targeting the correct audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. An amazing offer will fail if shown to the wrong people (e.g., winter coats in South Florida) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Match Your Avatar
> Ensure the person in your ad or content looks and talks like your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:00">[56:37:00]</a>. This helps algorithms display your content to the right people and increases responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>.

## Masters Have More Ways to Win
Masters in any field possess a "higher quality and quantity of metrics" to measure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:13:00">[59:13:00]</a>. Beginners often only look at binary outcomes (sold/didn't sell, got leads/didn't get leads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Leading vs. Lagging Indicators
> Focusing on **leading indicators** (e.g., list acquisition, call pick-up rates, hook effectiveness, offer conversion on first call, show-up rates for second call) allows you to fix issues iteratively and achieve the ultimate outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. **Lagging indicators** (e.g., churn, sales down, revenue down) are results that can't be directly acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
>
> "Look for directional correctness rather than binary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. This nuanced understanding of progress is crucial for [[strategies_for_business_growth_and_improvement | effective business growth and improvement]].

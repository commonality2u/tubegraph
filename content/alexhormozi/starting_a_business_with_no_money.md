If you're looking to [[starting_a_business_with_limited_skills_and_resources | start a business]] but feel [[starting_a_business_with_limited_skills_and_resources | broke or unsure where to begin]], a structured approach can help you define your business, identify your target audience, determine how to serve them, and craft a message to attract your first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This five-part framework, with two bonuses, aims to guide you to [[steps_to_achieve_first_online_business_success | make your first dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Step 1: What is Your Business? (The Three Ps Framework)

Most businesses originate from one of three "Ps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

1.  **Pain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   This refers to something you've personally experienced and had to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   *Example:* A friend with nine kids developed a system for efficiently preparing their daily lunches, which became the foundation of a potential business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. If you can solve a problem you've faced, that's a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
2.  **Profession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
    *   This is based on your current or past day job skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   *Example:* A registered dietitian learned a complex insurance billing system at a hospital due to long hours. She then quit her job and started teaching other dietitians how to bill insurance, turning her professional skill into a business earning almost a million dollars a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Any professional skill can be leveraged as a consultant, independent contractor, or by teaching others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Solving a very specific problem is a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
3.  **Passion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
    *   These are subjects you're inherently interested in, the articles you read, YouTube videos you watch, or podcasts you listen to in your spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* The speaker was deeply interested in fitness, reading related blogs daily. Friends even offered to front him money to [[starting_a_business_with_limited_skills_and_resources | start a gym]] because of his obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> "If you solve one very specific problem for somebody that is a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### Overcoming Initial Beliefs: The "Best Bad Idea"

It's a common misconception that you need to pick the "perfect" business idea on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The reality is that choosing *any* idea is the crucial first step, as it initiates an iteration process based on feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The goal is to get your "best bad idea" out there as quickly as possible, then refine it over time to make it "less wrong" until it becomes a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Step 2: Who Are You Going to Serve?

Once you have your "What," the next step is identifying your "Who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. There are three categories of people to serve:

1.  **People like you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
    *   You know their pains and aspirations because you've experienced them yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Sara Blakely created Spanx because she couldn't find underwear that met her personal needs, eventually [[building_a_valuable_business | building a billion-dollar business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This approach often leads to "missionary" businesses, driven by a genuine desire to help and improve the customer's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
2.  **People you've helped before** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
    *   This could be formally or informally, even if you weren't paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   *Example:* The speaker made his first dollar when a woman at the gym, seeking fitness advice, spontaneously paid him $100 after he helped her with food and recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **Underserved markets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
    *   This is a more formal market analysis, looking for growing markets with high demand and unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Narrowing Down Your Avatar

To clearly define your target audience, consider these five "frames" and select at least three to narrow down your "who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:

*   **Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   **Gender** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   **Profession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   **Problems/Pains** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   **Interests/Passions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

> *Example:* "35-year-old male accountants who are bored at their jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
> *Example:* "45-year-old women who are struggling to move up in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

The goal is to be narrow enough that when you describe them, they immediately feel you're talking directly to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Overcoming Initial Beliefs: Specificity and Price

A common belief is that being too narrow limits your earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. However, the more specific your target audience, the more you can charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   Broad time management PDF: $19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Time management for salespeople: $199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Time management for outbound salespeople: $1,999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   Outbound time management system for garden and power tools sales: $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>

Being highly specific creates a "blue ocean" where you have almost no competitors, allowing you to set your price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Step 3: How to Serve Them? (Upside & Downside)

This step involves understanding what your solution offers, both positively and negatively.

### How Part 1: The Upside (Good Stuff)

Describe all the positive outcomes and experiences your clients will achieve or avoid by using your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>:

*   How much **easier** their lives will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   How **guaranteed** the outcome is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   How much **faster** they will get what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   How it would **feel** to experience their dream scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

This aligns with the four elements of the value equation: easy, guaranteed, immediate, and exactly what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### How Part 2: The Downside (Bad Stuff to Avoid)

Motivation fundamentally stems from either gaining something desired or avoiding something hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This part focuses on the pain, sacrifice, and suffering your solution helps them avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>:

*   **Risks** they will avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   The **slowness** they won't experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   The **pain, sacrifice, and suffering** they won't have to endure to achieve their desired benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Specifically, address:
*   Good things they would normally have to give up (but won't with your system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   Bad things they would normally have to start doing (but won't with your system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

> "You want them to be like, 'I can't believe they know this about me,' because you know it about you and you just describe it back to them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>

### How to Gather This Information: The "Three-Letter Method"

If you haven't personally experienced the pains, the best way to gather this information is to **ASK** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Conduct interviews with your target audience:

*   What problems are they struggling with? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>
*   How long have they struggled? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
*   What makes it painful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>
*   Describe their ideal experience if it were done right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   What good things do they have to stop doing that they don't want to? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>
*   What bad things have they had to start doing with past solutions that they hate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>

The answers to these questions will inform both the "good stuff" and "bad stuff" you're going to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Step 4: Putting It All Together (The "Osim Money Mad Lib")

Combine the "Who," "Good Stuff," and "Bad Stuff" into a concise statement:

> "I help [Who] get [Good Stuff] without [Bad Stuff] through [Unique Mechanism - *optional, see Bonus 1*]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>

*   *Example (basic):* "I help 45-year-old women who just had kids get back into their high school jeans without giving up time with their family." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>
*   *Example (more advanced):* "I help non-fiction business authors get on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list without looking cringe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>

This sentence helps your target audience immediately recognize you're talking to them and addressing their specific needs and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Bonus 1: The Unique Mechanism

A unique mechanism differentiates your solution from others in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This is your "special sauce" that makes prospects believe your process is the missing piece to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

It typically takes the form of:
*   A **checklist**: A list of things someone has to do to achieve a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   A **sequence of steps**: A specific order of actions to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

You then "wrap" this process and give it a name, making it your **proprietary process** or unique mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

*   *Examples:* P90X's "muscle confusion," Weight Watchers' "point system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   *Your example:* The "five-step niche narrowing nunchuck" (referring to this video's framework) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

This mechanism acts as the vehicle that takes your customers from their current state to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## Bonus 2: Getting Your First Five Customers

To acquire your first five customers, use this simple system based on the sentence you developed in Step 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>:

1.  **Greet** someone (e.g., "Greetings," "Hello") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  **Mention something specific about them that's a compliment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
3.  **Insert the "I help who get good stuff without bad stuff" sentence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
4.  **Ask them if they know anybody who could benefit from that** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Repeat this process for four hours a day or until you reach 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Consistently applying this [[steps_to_achieve_first_online_business_success | warm outreach]] method will lead to your first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

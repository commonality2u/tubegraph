Scaling a business rapidly often "feels illegal" due to the extraordinary growth rates achievable through effective advertising strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For instance, Gym Launch grew to over $2 million per month within its first year, and Prestige Labs reached $1.5 million per month in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These achievements highlight the critical role of powerful [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | growth levers]] in business expansion.

## Addressing Obscurity: The First Step
For businesses under $1 million in revenue, the primary challenge is that "nobody knows you exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The initial four hours of every workday should be dedicated to moving from obscurity to awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This can be achieved through:
*   More outreach (cold or warm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   Content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Running ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

The key is to pick one method and commit fully to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Advertising as a "Boom"
Advertising is considered a "boom," a term referring to a "business order of magnitude change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While other business activities might offer optimizations (e.g., increasing close rates or conversion rates by 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, advertising has the potential to 100x the number of people who discover your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Many small business owners get stuck in an "optimization mouse trap," focusing on marginal gains rather than massive lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Marketplace Perception vs. Reality
Entrepreneurs often mistakenly believe their marketplace is small and competitive, imagining a fixed "pie" that shrinks with more players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In reality, the marketplace is vastly larger than perceived, with numerous communication methods and audience segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, a gym owner needing only 200 members can thrive in a city of 1 million people, even if 100 other gyms are advertising on the same platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Outcompeting by Growing: "Shrink Your Competition"
Instead of directly competing, a powerful [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | growth strategy]] is to "shrink your competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This involves two approaches, exemplified by Eminem's responses to hate:
1.  **Grow so big they become irrelevant:** Be so loud and prominent that competitors cannot be heard or seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is akin to building the tallest building, casting a shadow so large that smaller structures are obscured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
2.  **Kill them with kindness:** Respond to negativity with grace, disarming critics by claiming your flaws or offering congratulations for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This strategy involves overwhelming the marketplace to drown out competitors, making them irrelevant by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## The Power of Repetition: Most People Don't Know
Many business owners incorrectly assume that saying something once is enough for the entire world to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. In reality, most people need to be reminded more than they need to be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This means mastering variety in rephrasing the same message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Even established figures like Seneca, who died 2,000 years ago, have their quotes appreciated repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Clear, Not Clever Communication
A critical rule for marketing is "clear not clever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. High-converting ads often use simple language, understandable by a third grader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This approach lowers the comprehension barrier, allowing more people to understand the message, benefiting both experts and beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Using complex vocabulary might feed ego but not the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Richard Feynman's principle: "If you can explain it to a third grader, then you understand it; if you can't, you don't and you need to understand it better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Simplifying language and using appropriate analogies (e.g., cars for mechanics, houses for realtors, universal human experiences like food or sleep for broader audiences) increases comprehension and puts marketing and [[the_role_of_advertising_in_branding | advertising on steroids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This can be tested by running email copy through a reading grade level app, aiming for below fifth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. One experience resulted in a 50% increase in email conversion just by simplifying the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Proof Over Promise
While a strong offer is important, "proof is your single highest priority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. A business with a moderate promise but thousands of positive reviews will outperform one with a grand promise but little proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
Before launching a product, it's crucial to get beta users, even working for free, to gather testimonials, reviews, and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This process refines the product and generates compelling proof, allowing for "show, don't sell" advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The messenger (your credibility) is inextricably linked to the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## The Importance of the Hook
The "hook" is paramount in advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. No one will see your proof or message without a compelling hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Hooks can double, triple, or even 5x the number of people who open, click, or watch your content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This is a force multiplier, creating an order-of-magnitude change in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

A common hook formula is **Proof, Promise, Plan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Obsessing over the first few seconds or frames of an ad is critical, as it significantly impacts perception and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Trimming even three seconds from a video's beginning can dramatically increase views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

## The "More" Strategy: One to "N"
Growth can be achieved through "more, better, and new" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. While entrepreneurs often prefer "new" (shiny object syndrome), the "mundane more" is typically the highest risk-adjusted return strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
Once something works (a "control"), the most effective path is to scale it by doing "one to N" â€“ doing that successful thing as many times as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. For example, instead of trying to improve a 30% closing sales guy to 35%, hiring three more sales guys yields a 300% improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
Increasing volume in outreach, paid ads, or content posting directly leads to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Many businesses underestimate how much more they can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Perceived fears of increased volume are often unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

> [!TIP] "What presents as volatility is typically a symptom of low volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Consistent, high-volume activity smooths out perceived inconsistencies.

## Understanding Word of Mouth
While positive word of mouth (referrals) is valuable, negative word of mouth is significantly stronger and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Disney research suggests it takes 37 positive "magic moments" to make up for one negative "tragic moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
Rising cost per lead (CPL) when cost per impression (CPM) remains stable indicates fewer people are responding, often due to negative word of mouth working against the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. This highlights the importance of getting the product right, even working for free initially, to gather positive feedback and prevent negative sentiment from spreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

## "Steal From Yourself": The 70/20/10 Rule
When a message or process works, keep using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. Businesses get bored of their successful advertising far before their customers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. The "70/20/10 rule" suggests:
*   **70%** of effort should go into directly copying what already works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   **20%** on adjacent ideas, slightly varied from the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
*   **10%** on entirely new, "out of left field" initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.

Most entrepreneurs inverse this ratio, spending too much time on new ideas and too little on scaling what's proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Changing what works is more likely to destroy it than improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

## Emotional vs. Logical Buyers: The Continuum of Awareness
Instead of a binary "emotional vs. logical" buyer, consider a continuum of "high information" vs. "low information" buyers, also influenced by how much information they've already received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
Direct response marketing typically targets low-information, "most aware" buyers, a smaller pool that offers quick wins but limited scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. To scale significantly, businesses must educate a higher percentage of the audience who require more information before purchasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

### Eugene Schwarz's Five Levels of Awareness
Eugene Schwarz's "Breakthrough Advertising" outlines five levels of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>:
1.  **Unaware:** No idea about anything (broad curiosity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
2.  **Problem Aware:** Acknowledges a pain or problem (e.g., "Do you wake up to pee three times a night?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
3.  **Solution Aware:** Knows potential solutions and needs help choosing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.
4.  **Product Aware:** Knows specific products and needs details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
5.  **Most Aware:** Typically existing customers, ready for direct offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

### The 70/30 Give-to-Ask Ratio
To move people along this continuum and reach broader audiences, a 70/30 ratio of "give to ask" in advertising is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>. This means 70% of advertising impressions should be focused on giving value (storytelling, education, endorsements), building brand and goodwill, while only 30% is direct sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This approach, exemplified by New Balance's CMO, can take 18 months to see a return but builds long-term, sustainable demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
This strategy, especially for B2B, involves demonstrating aspirational outcomes, showing how others (like the prospect's avatar) have been helped, and providing free content or services (e.g., courses, free books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This creates "zero degrees of separation," where the prospect experiences value directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

## Marketing Laws: State the Facts & Tell the Truth
A core marketing principle is to "state the facts and tell the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. This forces businesses to change reality by "doing epic stuff" rather than exaggerating an underwhelming product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
This means:
1.  **Making the truth more compelling:** Actively changing reality to have impressive facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
2.  **Showing only what you can show:** Highlighting unique aspects of your business, even if narrow (e.g., a "double secret black belt" martial artist, or a cigarette company highlighting "toasted" tobacco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.
3.  **Saying what only you can say:** Emphasizing your distinct qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

The goal is to be the best in a "puddle," not necessarily the world. Being the best in a niche is more compelling from an advertising perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. John D. Rockefeller famously overpaid for a refinery to become the biggest, leveraging that "story" to consolidate the market, demonstrating the value of investing in brand and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

## The Importance of "The List" (Targeting)
Effective [[role_of_ad_targeting_in_business_success | advertising success]] heavily relies on targeting the correct audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. Showing winter coats to people in South Florida, for instance, won't yield results regardless of the offer or ad creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
In outreach, target individuals suffering from the problem you solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. For paid ads, leverage platform targeting features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. When creating content, the algorithm influences who sees it based on your appearance, speech, and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>. To attract a specific avatar, ensure the person in the ad looks like that avatar and that the communication matches their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Ultimately, "all marketing works as long as you get the targeting right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

## Mastery: More Ways to Win
Masters of advertising (and business functions) have a greater quantity and quality of metrics to measure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>. Beginners often rely on binary, lagging indicators (e.g., "sales are down") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, while masters track leading indicators and milestones along the entire process (e.g., cost to acquire talent, time to fill a role, two-sided fit for employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. This allows for precise identification and correction of issues at each step, ensuring "directional correctness" rather than just looking at the final outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. This comprehensive measurement is crucial for navigating the [[challenges_and_lessons_in_scaling_a_business | complexities of scaling]].

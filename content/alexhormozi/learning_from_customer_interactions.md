Direct interaction with customers, even through seemingly unscalable methods, is crucial for business growth and serves as a significant competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many businesses forgo this valuable opportunity, leaving significant money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Value of "Unscalable" Engagement

Initially, engaging with customers through methods that seem difficult to scale provides invaluable insights and benefits:

*   **Learning and Iteration**
    *   Direct conversations help businesses understand customer pain points and the most effective messaging hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This knowledge allows for the alteration of products and offers to achieve higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   By regularly asking specific questions, businesses can distill the core value they provide and identify less important features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
        *   "If I were to eliminate all of the things that I have in my feature set except for one, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> (Identifies core value)
        *   "If I were to eliminate one thing from my entire feature set and it changed nothing about your life, which one would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> (Identifies least valuable features)
    *   Talking to customers helps solve marketing and product problems, as customers inherently know what they want and how they wish to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This emphasizes [[leveraging_customer_feedback_for_business_improvement | leveraging customer feedback]] for business improvement.

*   **Building Relationships and Retention**
    *   Engaging in "unscalable" activities like personal calls, handwritten cards, or individual onboarding, even for low-paying customers, significantly impacts [[recurring_revenue_and_customer_retention | customer retention]] and [[the_importance_of_referrals_and_customer_retention | referrals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This also improves the product and marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Personalized communication, such as iMessages, voice notes, and videos from sales teams, is more effective than automated messages because customers perceive them as coming from a "real person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This contributes to [[building_trust_and_credibility_in_customer_relationships | building trust and credibility]] in customer relationships.

## Scaling the "Unscalable"

The concept of "unscalable" often stems from a "skill deficiency" rather than a physical impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. What appears unscalable with limited resources becomes achievable with more context and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Iterative Scaling Process**
    *   **Start One-on-One:** Begin by handling customer interactions individually, like personal calls or handwritten notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This period, where you "learn more than you earn," is critical for deep customer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   **Identify Patterns:** Over time, common questions and pain points emerge. This allows for the creation of presentations or standardized approaches to address frequent queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Group Interactions:** Transition from one-on-one to semi-private (e.g., 1-on-6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, then to larger groups (e.g., 1-on-20, 1-on-30) for activities like onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This multiplies output while retaining a personal touch.
    *   **Systematize and Delegate:** Once processes are refined and documented as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), they can be taught and delegated to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This approach turns a high-touch service into a productized, scalable offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[developing_a_highvalue_customer_acquisition_strategy | developing a high-value customer acquisition strategy]].

*   **The Small Business Advantage**
    *   Smaller businesses (under $10 million in revenue) possess the unique advantage of being able to implement "unscalable" strategies that large corporations cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This allows them to be more efficient per lead and pull out "all the stops" to secure opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Sales to Fulfillment Continuum

The "sales to fulfillment continuum" states that generally, the easier something is to sell, the harder it is to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

*   **"Done for you" services** are easy to sell because they promise comprehensive solutions but are difficult to fulfill due to high personal involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **"Do it yourself" models** are harder to sell but much easier to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Many businesses mistakenly start with "do it yourself" models, which are the hardest to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Done For You -> Done With You -> Do It Yourself Pyramid

A recommended approach for new product lines or businesses is to start at the top of the pyramid with the most expensive, "done for you" offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

1.  **Done for You:** This maximizes revenue per customer and provides the best results, leading to the development of critical SOPs that later productize the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Done with You:** Once SOPs are established, transition to a "done with you" model, where clients are assisted in doing it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This allows for selling to more people due to reduced support needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
3.  **Do It Yourself:** Finally, offer a "do it yourself" option, providing all the SOPs and guidance for self-implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

This top-down approach ensures a strong brand association, price anchoring, and a steady increase in customer volume with manageable operational load at each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

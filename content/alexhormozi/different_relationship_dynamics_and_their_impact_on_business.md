From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The speaker and his wife have successfully built six multi-eight-figure [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | companies]] in the last five years, with their current portfolio generating approximately $85 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They also run Acquisition.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores their insights into [[working_together_as_a_couple_in_business | building these companies together as a married couple]] and the [[challenges_of_managing_business_and_personal_relationships | balance between work life and marriage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Redefining Work-Life Balance

The speaker challenges the traditional notion of [[challenges_of_managing_business_and_personal_relationships | "work-life balance"]], asserting that individuals have "one life" lived on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. He suggests optimizing for activities one enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If working provides more stimulus than not working, then one should work, with the freedom to adjust if they feel they are trading off something they value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The speaker genuinely enjoys working, even preferring it on his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He believes that if one has achieved loving their work, they are simply "living" rather than "working" in the conventional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In 2021, despite owning profitable [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | companies]] and having substantial cash flow, the speaker did "nothing" and found it a "miserable year" because he couldn't spend the money he was making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This experience led him to realize his purpose was to work to create options, not to avoid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For him, the choice to work, even when financially not necessary, is the ultimate freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Marriage Dynamics and Business

A key point of discussion revolved around [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | marriage]] and [[the_transactional_nature_of_relationships | compromise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### The "Compromise" Perspective

One perspective shared was that [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | marriage]] inherently involves [[the_transactional_nature_of_relationships | compromise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For instance, if a spouse values quality time, working extensively might be seen as a point of contention requiring [[the_transactional_nature_of_relationships | compromise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Graham's experience mirrored this, where his girlfriend expected work to end by 5 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. To accommodate, Graham tried working from 5 AM to 5 PM, which was productive initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. However, over time, this forced schedule made him anxious, uptight, and "not himself" because he couldn't work during his preferred hours when focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The "No Compromise" Perspective

The speaker, however, holds a strong, uncommon belief that [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | marriage]] does not have to be a [[the_transactional_nature_of_relationships | compromise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He identifies two dynamics that work in long-term [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | relationships]]:

1.  **"We're In It Together"**:
    *   **Description**: Both partners are actively engaged in the "battlefield" or the [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: This dynamic fosters a unique shared respect that isn't achieved when one partner doesn't understand the demands of the "arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. There's an innate understanding and support for intense work periods without discussion or resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Financial Impact**: Couples in this dynamic tend to make five times more money than those in other structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Challenge**: The risk is becoming "too familiar" or like siblings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   **Correction**: To counteract this, the speaker and his wife intentionally create more space, working on separate sides of the house and not attending the same meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This allows them to have distinct experiences and share something new at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

2.  **"Cheerleader and Quarterback"**:
    *   **Description**: One partner leads (quarterback), and the other provides support (cheerleader) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Condition for Success**: A true cheerleader doesn't ask the quarterback to leave when the game is on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This dynamic requires a very aligned mission and goals for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   **Challenge**: Often, what appears to be a cheerleader dynamic can be "inverted," leading to sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Esther Perel's Insights on Relationship Dynamics

The speaker references Esther Perel's work on [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | relationships]], particularly her book "Mating in Captivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

*   **Mystery vs. Familiarity**: Initial attraction in [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | relationships]] is often built on mystery and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Over time, this shifts to familiarity and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **The "Sibling" Trap**: The problem arises when couples over-correct towards familiarity, becoming like siblings, which diminishes passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Dichotomy to be Managed**: A healthy [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | relationship]] is not a problem to be solved but a dichotomy of space versus familiarity to be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Impact of Shared vs. Separate Careers

*   **Entrepreneurs with Non-Business Spouses**: If entrepreneurs spend less time with their spouses due to [[business_growth_strategies_and_challenges | business]] demands, they can grow apart because they are exposed to different stimuli and adapt differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Couples Working Together**: While often financially lucrative, these couples risk becoming "too familiar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. They must actively create space to maintain individual experiences and prevent sibling-like dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Happiest Couples (on Average)**: The speaker notes that on average, the happiest couples are those where both individuals have separate careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These couples often have shared goals and values, mutual respect, and walk in parallel, naturally maintaining a balance of space and familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Ultimately, the speaker believes that one does not "have to [[the_transactional_nature_of_relationships | compromise]] anything if you don't want to" in a [[marriage_dynamics_in_professional_settings | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

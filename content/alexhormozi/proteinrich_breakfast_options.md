Achieving fitness goals like getting shredded in 2024 requires a focus on [[protein_consumption_in_diet | protein consumption]], and these breakfast options provide high-protein, zero-prep solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Many of these [[Highprotein recipes | high-protein recipes]] require no cooking time and minimal ingredients, making them ideal for individuals who struggle to eat enough or those aiming to manage their [[Caloric Intake and Protein Calculation | caloric intake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## 1. 100g Protein Greek Yogurt Bomb
This breakfast option offers nearly 100 grams of protein with minimal calories and prep time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Key Ingredients**:
    *   Fage 0% fat Greek yogurt (or similar brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A whole container has about 94g of protein and just under 500 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Yogurt is often easier on the stomach than milk for those sensitive to dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Crystal Light fruit punch (or Berry/Berry Sangria flavors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These are widely available, making this a good option for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   Fruity Pebbles cereal (preferred choice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. One cup contains 140 calories and 30g of carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Preparation**:
    1.  Pour Greek yogurt into a bowl (or directly into the container to avoid dishes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    2.  Add about half a packet of Crystal Light powder and mix thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This step also provides a "forearm pump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    3.  Sprinkle Fruity Pebbles on top in layers to maintain crunchiness, eating each layer before adding the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    4.  For [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting]], use a half cup of cereal (70 calories, 15g carbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

*   **Result**: A filling breakfast that tastes like yogurt with almost 100g of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## 2. Chocolate Egg Whites
This method provides 100g of pure protein with zero fat or carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

*   **Key Ingredients**:
    *   Ultra-pasteurized egg whites (e.g., "tall boys" containers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. These contain 20 servings of 5g protein, totaling 100g per container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
    *   Hershey's Zero Sugar chocolate syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This syrup has zero protein, zero fat, and is only 5 calories per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

*   **Preparation**:
    1.  Pour ultra-pasteurized egg whites into a container.
    2.  Add Hershey's Zero Sugar chocolate syrup to taste (e.g., 3-4 tablespoons for around 15-20 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
    3.  Mix well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

*   **Alternative Preparation (Cooked Egg Whites)**:
    1.  Microwave the chocolate-infused egg whites until they fluff up, typically around 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
    2.  Serve with canned salsa for added flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. A tall boy of egg whites will expand into a "mountain of food" when cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

*   **Tip**: When drinking, consume about 95% of the mixture, as the last 5% can be gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

    3.  For a fancy presentation, dust with cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## 5. "Bro Nachos" (Unconventional Breakfast)
While typically a lunch or dinner, this high-protein meal can serve as a "wild" breakfast for those daring enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

    3.  Add about 1.5 cups of yogurt to reach the 100g protein target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

It is possible to enjoy dessert virtually every night while maintaining a lean physique, a practice demonstrated by Alex Hormozi for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach prioritizes **[[maintaining_fitness_with_simple_nutrition | simple nutrition]]** and **[[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexible eating]]** over strict, conventional **[[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting and nutrition strategies]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Hormozi emphasizes that he is sharing what has worked for him, not necessarily the most scientifically researched method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This method has been adopted by many entrepreneurs who have seen its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Principles

The foundation of this dietary strategy is to first determine your fitness goal: whether you aim to gain size or lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Target Calories

To find your daily caloric intake, multiply your body weight by a coefficient ranging from 7 to 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This range corresponds to different goals:
*   **7-9**: Extreme weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **10-12**: Moderate weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **13-15**: Maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **16-18**: Moderate weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   **19-21**: Extreme weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

For example, a 200 lb individual aiming for a moderate cut might use a coefficient of 10, resulting in 2,000 calories per day (200 lbs * 10 = 2,000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Adjustments can be made; if weight loss is too rapid, increase the coefficient slightly (e.g., from 10 to 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Daily exercise or physical job demands are generally not significant factors for initial calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Step 2: Calculate Your Protein Intake

Multiply your body weight by one to determine your protein target in grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For a 200 lb individual, this means 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Common protein sources and their approximate protein content:
*   One pound of lean meat (e.g., white fish, ground turkey breast 96/4, ground beef, shrimp) provides roughly 100 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Therefore, 200 grams of protein would require about 2 pounds of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Hormozi personally consumes more than 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight because he enjoys it and finds it filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Step 3: Determine Your "Flex" Calories

Once you have your total daily calories (Step 1) and protein target (Step 2), calculate the caloric contribution of your protein intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Subtract these protein calories from your total daily calories to find your "flex" calories. These are the remaining calories that can be consumed from any food source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

**Example for a 200 lb person on a moderate cut (2,000 calories):**
*   Target protein: 200g (equivalent to 2 lbs of meat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   If 2 lbs of turkey account for 1,120 calories (560 calories per pound of turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Remaining "flex" calories: 2,000 (total) - 1,120 (protein) = 880 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

These 880 "flex" calories offer significant **[[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexibility]]**:
*   Attending business dinners with drinks (e.g., two 150-calorie cocktails + a 500-calorie meal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Enjoying an entire pint of ice cream (approx. 880 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Having two 400-calorie cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

For maintenance goals, such as a 200 lb individual aiming for 3,000 calories (200 lbs * 15 = 3,000 calories), the "flex" calories increase substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If protein intake remains the same (1,120 calories), this leaves 1,880 "flex" calories, allowing for even larger dessert portions or varied meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## [[alex_hormozis_daily_diet_routine | Alex Hormozi's Daily Diet Routine]]

Hormozi follows a consistent eating pattern for his breakfast and lunch, with dinner serving as his primary "flex" meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This **[[unconventional_diet_explanation | unconventional diet]]** ensures he meets his protein goals while allowing for dietary freedom.

*   **Breakfast**: A 200-calorie bar (e.g., Quest Bar) with 20g of protein, combined with a shake providing 30g of protein and 160 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Total Breakfast: 360 calories, 50g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Lunch**: One pound of turkey (560 calories) and a half cup of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   Total by Lunch: 1,140 calories, 150g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Dinner**: The "big flex meal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Hormozi typically consumes another pound of protein at dinner, totaling 250g of protein for the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The remaining calories are allocated to whatever he desires, ensuring he feels full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

He supplements his diet with a multivitamin, not focusing on greens within his meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Philosophy

This strategy has proven effective for many, with some individuals reporting significant weight loss (e.g., 50 lbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Hormozi avoids engaging in extensive "armchair debates" about fitness methodologies, focusing on what delivers results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He may create a future video detailing his training routine as an entrepreneur, which differs from that of professional athletes or bodybuilders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

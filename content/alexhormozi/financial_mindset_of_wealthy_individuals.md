The financial mindset of wealthy individuals often contrasts sharply with those who have less money, particularly regarding spending habits and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. According to one perspective, individuals who progress financially tend to surround themselves with others who also possess more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Ironically, these wealthier individuals often spend less money and have a reduced desire to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. They also actively seek ways to acquire things for less money out of pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## The Value of Skills Over Assets

A fundamental aspect of [[mindset_changes_for_achieving_financial_goals | achieving financial success]] is the emphasis on acquiring and utilizing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Skills are considered a unique and powerful asset because they cannot be taken away by governments, individuals in a divorce, revolutions, or financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This inherent security allows entrepreneurs, even after hitting rock bottom, to often bounce back rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. For example, one individual who lost everything managed to collect $110,000 in cash sales within the next 30 days due to their existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Strategic Investment and Acquisition

Wealthy individuals exhibit distinct [[personal_finance_habits_and_strategies | personal finance strategies]] when it comes to investment, prioritizing stability and controlled growth over high-risk, high-reward ventures.

### Risk Aversion
People who are genuinely wealthy tend to be more risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This is because the downside risk of losing everything becomes significantly larger once wealth has been accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Thirty years of sound financial decisions can be reversed by a single bad investment that results in zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Therefore, the wealthy often have a lower risk tolerance than those with less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

Instead of seeking massive returns with guaranteed risk, they prefer guaranteed small returns with no risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This mindset contrasts with individuals who might purchase lottery tickets, which are considered the worst possible investment due to their high downside risk and minimal upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### Acquiring Assets for Zero Out of Pocket
A key [[smart_money_management_techniques | smart money management technique]] involves seeking opportunities to acquire assets for little to no upfront cost. This often involves:

*   **Agreeing on Price, Then Terms**: A powerful negotiation tactic is to first agree on the purchase price of a business or asset, and *then* negotiate the terms of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This allows for structuring the deal to minimize initial cash outlay.
*   **Seller Financing**: One common term is seller financing, where the seller allows the buyer to pay over time, reducing or eliminating the need for an immediate large payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This can involve the seller financing a significant portion of the deal, with a smaller portion potentially financed by a bank loan (e.g., SBA loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Motivated Sellers**: Opportunities often arise from businesses with motivated sellers who are tired of their business or facing personal crises, making them willing to sell for a lower price or with flexible terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. These deals are typically not publicly listed and require proactive searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

#### Case Study: Acquiring a Gym for No Money Down
An illustrative example involves acquiring a gym for no money down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. After agreeing on a price, the buyer negotiated to pay the full amount over 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Within the first 30 days, the gym generated enough sales ($51,000) to cover its own cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. This effectively meant acquiring a cash-flowing asset for nothing, which continued to generate profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with previous experiences where significant capital (e.g., $40,000 or $250,000) was invested to open gyms that did not necessarily yield proportionally higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Patience and Character Traits
[[Mindset shifts for financial success | Achieving financial success]] also requires [[importance_of_financial_discipline_and_longterm_planning | patience]] and specific character traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Instead of rushing into a deal, successful individuals are willing to wait for months to find the right opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. This long-term perspective allows for securing deals that yield significantly higher returns with minimal risk, even if it means waiting for the opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

In summary, the financial mindset of wealthy individuals is characterized by:
*   Prioritizing skills over material assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   A strong aversion to significant financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   A preference for stable, low-risk returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.
*   Strategic acquisition of businesses or assets with minimal or no upfront capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   Patience and a long-term perspective in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

This approach demonstrates how [[building_and_maintaining_wealth | building and maintaining wealth]] is often more about strategic thinking and a specific mindset than simply having large sums of money to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

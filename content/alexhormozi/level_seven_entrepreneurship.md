From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

Level seven entrepreneurship is defined as rising above individual businesses and viewing them as products that enhance personal net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This perspective encourages assessing and appraising opportunity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. A "level seven zillion entrepreneur" is someone who contemplates the meaning of life because they no longer have a need for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

## Speaker's Journey and Perspective

The speaker, Alex Hormozi, identifies as a "level seven entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, although he humbly states he feels like he's just taken "a couple steps forward and one toe after the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. He owns acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies generating approximately $85 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. In his 20s, he earned more in a single year than the CEOs of McDonald's, Ikea, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, which has translated to over $1.2 million per month in dividends for nearly half a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

Having exited two companies and sold his house and car this year, he is in a season of "consolidation" and "distilling down artifacts" (frameworks) to prepare for his next chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

**Observations at Level Seven:**
*   Most people want you to do well, but not better than them; no one truly wants you to be rich except yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. If you're not fighting for yourself, no one else is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   Money only solves money problems, leaving you with problems money cannot solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   You don't "arrive"; you simply enter a new club as the smallest member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   Having exited the traditional organizational chart and still making significant income, the speaker found it "wildly boring and almost depressing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. This suggests that passive income can be overrated, and the real desire is for options and engaging activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. The goal should be to engage in meaningful work rather than idleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## The "Boat" Metaphor: Strategic Decisions over Effort

Warren Buffett shared a story about a smart, hard-working, ethical friend from Columbia Business School who chose the steel business, earning a modest living, while Buffett started his private partnership that became Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Buffett concluded: "It's not as important how hard you row, but what boat you are in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This highlights that different outcomes can arise from a single, pivotal decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Time Allocation as the Only Resource
Material success is primarily a function of time allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Money is considered the "denomination of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>; wealth is measured by how little of one's life must be traded for desired goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Money acts as an IOU from society for future goods and services, essentially "other people's time" for the value provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

### Speed in Entrepreneurship
True speed in entrepreneurship isn't about constant activity, which is a fallacy many entrepreneurs believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Instead, it's about making the right strategic decisions and making fewer mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs exhibit "micro fast, macro slow" behavior, moving quickly but often changing directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The key is "micro slow, macro fast," where consistent forward movement over a long period leads to significant progress by avoiding detours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Consistently Doing the Obvious
Ninety percent of success comes from "consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time" without believing you are smarter than you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Naval Ravikant's quote, "I only believe that one percent of decisions matter; the rest of them are irrelevant. The difficulty is understanding which of the one percent of the 99% of the ones that matter," emphasizes the importance of these critical strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

## Frameworks for Material Success

The speaker introduces four frameworks for applying leverage to achieve material success, which are used when investing in portfolio companies and scaling one's own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. These are:
1.  Scale the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>
2.  Scale the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>
3.  Scale the deliverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>
4.  Scale the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>

The equation for fortune building is: Level 10 Entrepreneur x Level 10 Opportunity (Market x Scalability of Deliverable) x Business Acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

### 1. [[identifying_skills_and_resources_for_budding_entrepreneurs | Scale the Entrepreneur]]

Entrepreneurs often do not achieve desired financial outcomes because they are not as skilled as they believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. If a competitor is outperforming, it's due to their superior play; acknowledging deficiencies and learning from competitors' strengths is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

**Bottlenecks:** Every business is bottlenecked by the entrepreneur in one of three ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>:
1.  **Lack a skill** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>
2.  **Lack a character trait** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>
3.  **Lack a belief** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>

Like a ladder, if any side (traits, beliefs, skills) is missing, growth is limited to the lowest rung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.

**Case Studies of Deficiencies:**
*   **Niche Slapping Fallacy:** The speaker initially had 10 businesses but no money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. His wife advised him to pick one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. The problem was the fallacy that pursuing many ventures would lead to success; in reality, pursuing all means none will work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. This was identified as a trait deficiency: lack of [[commitment_and_focus_in_entrepreneurship | focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>.
*   **Level 10 Skill, Level 2 Opportunity:** A mentor told the speaker he had a "level 10 skill set in a level 2 opportunity" while running gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. The mentor suggested teaching others his gym model instead of running gyms himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. This was a belief deficiency; he didn't know a higher leverage opportunity was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Team Inconsistency:** The common complaint "no good sales people exist" or "my sales team is inconsistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a> is a skill deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. It indicates a lack of skills in recruiting, interviewing, training, and managing a high-performance sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.

**Learning and Improvement:**
*   To improve, rephrase a bottleneck or complaint into a solvable question (e.g., "How do I learn to create consistency in sales?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.
*   Skills are developed through repetition and feedback, or "volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. The speaker closed 4,000 one-on-one sales over 3.5 years, building his certainty and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.
*   Work changes the individual more than they change the work; it builds character and increases capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. This aligns with "do the boring work" and "outwork yourself doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. Conviction comes from repeated action, not affirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>.
*   A major deficiency is unrealistic expectations. People aim to be millionaires in 90 days instead of committing to a five-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. "I'd rather get rich for sure than get rich quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>.
*   Skills, traits, and beliefs all compound, leading to "crazy outside returns seemingly overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. This is known as [[the_role_of_specialized_skills_in_entrepreneurship | skill stacking]], where combining different proficiencies (e.g., math, bookkeeping, accounting, tax strategy, insurance, deal negotiation, capital markets) creates asymmetrical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>.

### 2. [[strategies_for_entrepreneurial_success | Scale the Market]]

When the speaker was earning $35-40 million, he realized peers making more money had simply "picked better markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>, often mass markets selling expensive products globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>.

**How to Pick Your Market:**
*   The best avatar to pursue is the one you can help the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.
*   Pick an avatar that allows you to productize your service and deliver value with low operational drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>.

**The "Starving Crowd" Analogy:** A marketing professor's story illustrates that having a starving crowd (high demand) is the ultimate competitive advantage, even if the product or location is suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>.

**Four Attributes of a Desirable Market:**
1.  **Pain:** They must not just want, but desperately need, what is being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Affordability:** The target audience must be able to afford the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>.
3.  **Targetability:** They must be easy to tactically reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Growing:** The market should be expanding, not shrinking. Choosing a market with a "tailwind" makes growth easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>.

Revisiting the "what boat you are in" metaphor, a great entrepreneur in a poor market will likely lose to a great market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.

**Five Ways to Scale Your Market:**
1.  **Up Market:** Target multi-location owners, chains, or franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Down Market:** Target individuals who will eventually become your ideal avatar (e.g., hair stylists for salon owners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Adjacent Market:** Target similar niches with core desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>.
4.  **Broader:** Expand to wider related sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.
5.  **Deeper (Favorite Strategy):** Focus on existing market by acquiring competitors, exploring new platforms, or increasing ad budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>. Doing "more of the thing that you're already doing" often works best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.

### 3. [[entrepreneurship_and_business_growth_mindset | Scale the Deliverable]]

This framework is an "opportunity lens" to assess ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.

**The Four Cs to Leverage:**
1.  **Labor:** Traditional leverage, requiring permission (e.g., employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:00">[35:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Capital:** Using other people's money, also requiring permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Code:** Permissionless leverage, replicable at no cost (e.g., software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Content/Media:** Permissionless leverage, zero cost of replication (e.g., podcasts, books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>.

The "new fortunes" are built on code and content/media due to their permissionless nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:00">[37:06:00]</a>. The most successful entrepreneurs (e.g., Bezos, Zuckerberg) utilize all four forms of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

**Speaker's Leverage Trajectory:**
*   **Employee (Management Consultant):** Leveraging others' labor, earning four figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>.
*   **Trainer (Self-Employed):** Leveraging own labor, earning five figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>.
*   **Gym Owner:** Leveraging labor, earning six figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.
*   **Licensor:** Leveraging labor and media, earning millions/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Business:** Adding capital leverage, aiming for eight figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.
*   **Full Stack:** Aiming for nine figures/month by utilizing all four leverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[39:04:00]</a>.

**The Delivery Cube Framework:** This framework provides six dimensions to consider when scaling a deliverable for increased profit margins:
1.  **Setting:** One-on-one, small group, or one-to-many (and adjusting price accordingly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Solution Type:** Do-it-yourself (DIY), done-with-you (DWY), or done-for-you (DFY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Support Level:** Tech, chat, email, phone, or Zoom call support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>.
4.  **Consumption:** Written, live, audio-only, or video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.
5.  **Speed & Convenience:** 24/7, 9-to-5, immediate response, or two-day response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.
6.  **Value-Price Matrix:**
    *   What would you deliver if your price was 10x higher? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>
    *   What would you need to build (at no replication cost) to deliver more value at 1/10th the price? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>
    *   If new customer acquisition through marketing was impossible, and the only way to get customers was through existing ones, how would the client experience change? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:10:00">[42:10:00]</a> (Emphasizes word-of-mouth and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:41:00">[42:41:00]</a>).

**Types of Things to Sell:** All marketable offerings can be broken down into six base components:
1.  **Products:** Physical (e.g., dog bones) or Digital (e.g., courses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Services:** Physical (e.g., massage) or Digital (e.g., marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Access:** Physical (e.g., event entry) or Digital (e.g., virtual recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Media:** Physical (e.g., billboard) or Digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>.
5.  **Risk:** Physical (e.g., building insurance) or Digital (e.g., cyberattack insurance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>.
6.  **Money:** Physical or Digital (e.g., cryptocurrency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:29:00">[44:29:00]</a>.

An "experience" is a combination of products, services, and access. A "business" is all these chunks combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:52:00">[44:52:00]</a>. The challenge is to add components to an existing offer stack without excessive operational drag, while providing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.

### 4. [[entrepreneurship_landscape_in_2024 | Scale the Business]]

This framework outlines focus areas at different revenue levels for scaling businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>.

*   **Zero to One Million:**
    *   **Focus:** One product, one avatar, one channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Problem:** Lack of clarity on operations; trying to do too much. More businesses don't automatically mean more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Objective:** Consistently sell something people actually want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.

*   **One to Ten Million:**
    *   **Focus:** Increase lifetime gross profit per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:53:00">[47:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Problem:** Not enough take-home profit to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Objective:** Add higher leverage deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>.

*   **Ten to Fifty Million:**
    *   **Focus:** Professionalize the business and improve consistency of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Problem:** Inconsistent delivery, poor tracking, CRM issues, financial disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Hire high-level, experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:43:00">[48:43:00]</a>.

*   **Fifty Million Plus (Framework X): Attract Talent**
    *   **Problem:** Innovation dies at this level because one entrepreneur can only do so much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:23:00">[49:23:00]</a>. The business becomes a conglomeration of many smaller businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:36:00">[49:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Attract new talent incentivized to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:58:00">[49:58:00]</a>.

**Internal Business Functions vs. External Marketing Metrics:**
Entrepreneurs often focus on external metrics (lead generation, nurture, sales, customer success, ascension, resell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:13:00">[50:13:00]</a>. However, scaling requires understanding and optimizing internal functions that mirror these external ones, such as:
*   Applications received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:44:00">[50:44:00]</a>
*   Application-to-call booking rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:45:00">[50:45:00]</a>
*   Interview-to-full-time role transition rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>
*   Employee onboarding and training effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>
*   Defined career paths and ascension for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:00">[50:57:00]</a>
*   Employee retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>

Often, the bottleneck for growth lies in these internal talent acquisition and development processes, rather than external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:18:00">[52:18:00]</a>. One amazing hire can unlock significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:38:00">[52:38:00]</a>.

These frameworks provide actionable insights for entrepreneurs at any stage, aiming to accelerate their path to material success by making smarter, more leveraged strategic decisions.

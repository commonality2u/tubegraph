When considering what to sell, it's essential to define the fundamental categories of sellable items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. There are fewer distinct types than one might initially assume, but they can exist in both digital and physical formats, resulting in 14 possible variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Seven Core Categories

1.  **Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Tangible items, such as water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Non-tangible items, like a PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Actions performed for others, such as a massage, lawn mowing, or car repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Actions performed in a digital space, like an ad agency creating advertisements or buying media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Gaining entry or use of a physical space, such as leasing a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Gaining entry or use of digital content, like a Netflix library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
4.  **Attention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Selling visibility to a physical audience, exemplified by a billboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Selling the viewership or engagement of a digital audience, as done by Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
5.  **Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Providing protection against physical loss or damage, such as insuring a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Providing protection against digital threats, like cyber threat insurance, or paid guarantees for products (e.g., AppleCare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
6.  **Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
    *   The entire banking industry is based on buying and [[sales_and_product_development | selling]] money, with interest as the charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Physical**: Tangible currency, like US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Non-tangible currency, such as cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
7.  **Endorsement or Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Licensing the use of a logo or brand on physical goods in exchange for royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Selling status or verification in the digital realm, such as a checkmark on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Combining Products and Services

It's possible to combine these categories to enhance the value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a rock concert involves [[different_types_of_products_and_services | selling]] access to an experience (Access) but can also include [[combining_products_and_services_to_enhance_value | selling]] physical products like drinks and t-shirts (Products), and later, digital recordings of the event (Digital Products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Choosing What to Sell

The decision of what to sell primarily depends on two factors:
*   The resources available to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Your skills, value, and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Even as a first-time entrepreneur, you possess experience gained from your upbringing, family, or past odd jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For instance, growing up with a parent who is an eye surgeon provides knowledge about eyes, just as a mechanic's child might understand carburetors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

With limited capital, such as $100, selling physical products or complex software might be out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In such cases, the most common starting point is to sell your time, often in the form of [[strategies_for_making_money_in_service_businesses | services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The "sweet spot" for a new venture is identifying who you can provide the most value to for the least cost to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Delivery Cube: Enhancing Value and Profitability

Once you've identified what to sell, the "delivery cube" offers six lenses to enhance or adjust its value and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:

1.  **Delivery Model (Scale)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   **One-to-one**: High value, less scalable (e.g., individual call review) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **Small group**: Mid-level value (e.g., semi-private group sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   **One-to-many**: Lower value per individual, highly scalable (e.g., a webinar to a thousand people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

2.  **Level of Involvement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
    *   **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)**: Most scalable, typically lower value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Done With You (DWY)**: In-between DIY and Done For You, involving guided support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **Done For You (DFY)**: Least scalable, most expensive, often easiest to sell but hardest to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

3.  **Support Medium** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
    *   Options include chat, email, phone call, or Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Email support is highly scalable but less valuable than real-time Zoom call support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

4.  **Consumption Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
    *   Customers can consume content visually (text, video), audibly, live, or via recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   Live content is generally perceived as more valuable, especially in-person, but is less scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Recorded digital content is highly scalable but often perceived as less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

5.  **Speed and Convenience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   This relates to hours of operation (24/7 vs. 9-5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, days of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, and response times (e.g., 24-hour guarantee vs. 3-minute response) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Businesses can choose to incur inefficiency through overstaffing for customer convenience or have customers incur inefficiency through longer waits to maximize staff utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

6.  **The 10x to 1/10th Test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
    *   **10x Price**: If you charged 10 times more for your product or service, what would you need to change to justify that higher price and provide significantly more value? This encourages [[creating_value_propositions_for_luxury_products | thinking bigger]] about the value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   **1/10th Price**: If you had to deliver the same or more value but could only charge one-tenth of the current price, what cost-effective additions or changes would you make to maintain perceived value? This helps in [[strategies_for_business_growth_through_advertising_and_sales | scaling]] and making the offering more accessible while maintaining profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

By considering these factors, entrepreneurs can effectively choose their initial [[entrepreneurship_and_selling_strategies | product or service]] to sell and then strategically [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | scale]] it to be more profitable and valuable to the end consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

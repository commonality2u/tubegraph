A significant financial pitfall for individuals in their 20s is [[common_mistakes_keeping_people_poor | underspending on education]] and overspending on status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This mistake, if made early, can have long-lasting financial repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Illusion of Status

In one's 20s, it's common to not be financially "balling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Displaying overt signs of wealth, such as bought Instagram checkmarks or posing with luxury cars, is easily recognized as disingenuous by those who understand genuine success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. People who are genuinely successful are not impressed by a $200,000 watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Instead, successful individuals appreciate seeing young people who are "eating poor, learning and hustling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Driving expensive cars like a Rolls or Benz, while maxing out expenditures to "flex" to other twenty-year-olds, is considered foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. True status and respect in your 20s come from performing the right actions and investing in your capacity to earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Those on the wrong path, focused on superficial status, may be disregarded by successful mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Prioritizing Learning Over Earning

A significant mistake is taking jobs solely for immediate income rather than for the knowledge and skills they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. In one instance, a candidate rejected a job offer for a mere $3,000 more a year, missing the fundamental point that they were in a season of learning, not earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Organizations willing to pay a "premium" often do so for existing knowledge, meaning they may not offer opportunities for growth and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Attempting to "cash in early" by prioritizing earning in one's 20s is shortsighted, as an extra $10,000 or $25,000 annually is inconsequential compared to the long-term earning potential gained from acquiring valuable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_learning_over_earning_for_young_peoples_success | importance of learning over earning]] for long-term success.

## Investing in Yourself: The Number One Asset

Paradoxically, simply "saving money" in your 20s can be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While not spending money on frivolous items is wise, that capital should be actively invested, not just saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> "Instead of saving money to invest in assets, invest in the number one asset which is you and increasing your earning potential." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

Traditional investments like dollar-cost averaging into an S&P 500 fund are beneficial but may not lead to significant wealth for those starting with low income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The true path to wealth in your 20s is to invest in yourself and your earning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Saving a few hundred dollars a month will yield minimal returns over decades when inflation is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In contrast, spending $10,000 to double or triple your earning capacity can provide a far greater return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[investing_in_education_and_skills_to_overcome_ignorance_debt | investing in education and skills development]].

### Financial Priorities and Habits

To effectively invest in oneself:
*   **Prioritize Investment First** Decide how much you will invest in your learning and education *before* spending any other money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This involves setting aside funds at the top, allowing them to accumulate, and then deploying the capital when learning opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This is part of [[balancing_life_priorities_and_financial_goals | balancing life priorities]].
*   **Automate Investment, Manualize Spending** Make it effortless to invest in yourself by automating transfers to a dedicated investment account for personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Conversely, make it harder to spend on non-returning items, perhaps by using cash instead of credit cards, as cash transactions create a physical pain that reduces impulse buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Avoid Aimless Shopping** Resist the urge to "go shopping" without a specific list, as this often leads to wasteful spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Stick to a pre-approved budget and only purchase items on your list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Measure Savings, Not Earnings** Focus on how much you are saving to invest in yourself, rather than simply how much you are earning or spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Set personal records for the amount you put into your investment account each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Daily Account Monitoring** Regularly check your bank account, ideally every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This confronts reality, identifies spending patterns, and fosters discipline, similar to how daily weighing can aid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Modeling the Right Season of Life

It's crucial not to emulate the current lifestyle of highly successful individuals when you are in a different stage of your financial journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, flying private is a sign of spending a lot of money, not necessarily wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Reputation is built on past actions and promises kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Therefore, aspiring individuals should model the actions successful people took in their earlier, formative "season of life," rather than their current affluent habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Effective [[Decision Making and Risk Taking | decision-making]] and learning are significantly enhanced by adopting a humble mindset and prioritizing listening over speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key insight is that one cannot truly learn if they are constantly talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Learning Through Humility

From early experiences in college, where the emphasis was on demonstrating intelligence through speaking and participation, the speaker initially translated this behavior into the "real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, this approach proved ineffective for learning, as constant talking meant little absorption of new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

A turning point came from situations where blabbering about one's own knowledge led to shame and embarrassment upon discovering the other person was significantly more accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This led to a critical shift in how the speaker approached new interactions and entered rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The fundamental principle for making better [[Decision Making and Risk Taking | decisions]] is the necessity of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This requires an intentional effort *not* to talk, allowing for greater absorption of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Power of Listening

By shifting from posturing to listening, the speaker found they could gain valuable insights from others, even those less experienced or successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When others talked, the speaker learned about their personality, career stage, and potential areas for follow-up, while the other person often learned nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This contrast highlighted the benefit of prioritizing learning over self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Humility in Business and Life

The speaker defines humility not as thinking less of oneself, but as increasing one's regard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This definition, attributed to Harvard Professor Clayton Christensen, emphasizes service and contribution to a group as a means of gaining status and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Instead of seeking status by taking, giving more to the group than one receives is rewarded behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. People who try to gain status by taking are often "banished" or "batted down" by the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

This understanding of group dynamics, where giving status and respect first leads to receiving it back, was a crucial realization that enabled the speaker to achieve positions of leadership, such as fraternity president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Challenging External Opinions

A significant aspect of [[Decisionmaking power and personal development | personal development]] involves discerning whose opinions matter when making [[Decision Making and Risk Taking | decisions]] about one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Given that most people will forget about an individual shortly after their death, external opinions, especially from those without a vested interest in one's success or relevant context, hold little weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Many unsolicited opinions are projections of others' beliefs and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. If one doesn't admire the life the advice-giver leads, then their counsel is likely not worth listening to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Ultimately, quieting the internal "non-existent voices" of judgment from others frees up mental energy and focus, allowing for action and progress, which are essential for true [[Decisionmaking power and personal development | personal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

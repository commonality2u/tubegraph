The concept of "overnight success" often brings a swift and significant shift in how others perceive an individual, moving from supportive encouragement to, at times, resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This dynamic highlights a common sentiment: people wish others well, but only to a certain extentâ€”specifically, as long as that success does not surpass their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Shifting Perception of Success

A prime example of this phenomenon is seen in the story of a business guru who initially slept in the gym where he personal trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His trainees expressed admiration and hopes for his future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, once he achieved financial [[strategies_for_entrepreneurial_success | success]], owned the gym, and took on the role of manager, their attitude shifted to questioning his authority, asking, "Oh, you're the boss now, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

This pattern is also observed in public figures like Sam Sulek, who experienced an "almost [[fast_business_growth_strategies | overnight]]" explosion in popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Initially, supporters likely wished him success on YouTube or in becoming a professional bodybuilder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Yet, once he started achieving those [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | goals]] and even more, a similar change in perception among those in his world likely occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## From Underdog to "The Man"

The experience of living through this shift can be profoundly [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | difficult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. To process it, one individual wrote an essay titled "Everyone believes in the American dream until it comes true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This essay explored the critical point at which someone transitions from being the [[transition_from_underdog_to_leader | underdog]] to becoming "the man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This statement encapsulates the core sentiment, suggesting that support often wanes when one's success surpasses the perceived status or achievements of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

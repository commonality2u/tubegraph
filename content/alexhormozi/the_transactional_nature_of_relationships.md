From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

The speaker views relationships, particularly friendships, through a lens of utility and exchange, emphasizing that all relationships are inherently transactional, even if the term "transactional" carries a commercial connotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the need for mutual reinforcement and value to sustain connections over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Shedding Relationships for Growth

The speaker notes that their close circle has always been very small, and they tend to [[the_concept_of_shedding_old_identities_and_relationships | shed friends]] regularly throughout their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This quick growth is attributed to not holding onto things that no longer provide value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Life is viewed in "three to five year seasons," each bringing different friendships that are often left behind as one evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. For example, high school and college friends were largely left behind after those respective seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### The Price of Greatness
Achieving greatness often requires making choices that the majority are unwilling to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Society often tells stories about friends leaving their hometowns and forgetting their origins, which is often narrated by the majority who get left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Everyone may share the same goals, but it is the willingness to "pay the price" that distinguishes winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Identity and Labels

One significant reason for cutting people out of one's life is to avoid the labels they might impose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. People from one's past often maintain an identity of who they know you to be, and they might reinforce that label when you try to change or grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. When someone says, "You've changed," the best response is often, "Yeah, you haven't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Surrounding oneself with people who don't believe the "lies you used to tell about yourself" is crucial for [[the_role_of_personal_growth_in_maintaining_a_strong_relationship | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Entrepreneurship, in particular, requires a willingness to [[the_concept_of_shedding_old_identities_and_relationships | shed old identities]] and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## The Transactional Nature of Relationships

The amount one loves or likes someone is directly proportional to what they are willing to give up to maintain the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. All relationships involve an exchange where both parties gain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This is explained through the concept of behavioral reinforcement and punishment: a behavior is either reinforced or it is punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The strength of a relationship can be measured by how long one is willing to wait for the next positive reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Even long-standing friendships may be cut off if positive reinforcement ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

> "The amount you like or love someone is directly proportional what you are willing to give up to maintain the relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>

### Evaluating Relationships
The speaker uses a filter to determine which friends are loved the most based on the willingness to sacrifice for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Time, focus, and energy are limited resources that must be poured into a single direction for optimal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. For example, the speaker dedicates one hour per week to their closest friend, recognizing the mutual exchange and joy it brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. In contrast, an old teacher who asked for a two-hour weekly call was declined because the value of that relationship was primarily in the past, and the time commitment was too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Societal Norms vs. Personal Growth

Society often dictates that one should maintain relationships, leading to a "bad friend" narrative if they are cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. However, letting go of relationships that no longer serve one's goals frees up space for new connections that align better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Relationships where participants want different things are often better served by parting ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

It is important to be kind by telling the truth and being honest in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This includes being direct about concerns or a desire to disassociate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Direct communication can lead to either stronger relationships or the end of superficial ones, potentially helping the other person recognize misaligned paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

> "You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and somehow achieve a different outcome." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>

People's judgments about how one spends time are simply expressions of how they would not spend their own time the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. The idea of "friends for life" is largely a romanticized story, and it's acceptable for relationships to be seasonal and not last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

## Finding New Communities

Once outdated friendships are weeded out, the best approach is to join communities that align with one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. By committing to these communities, individuals can rise within them and then potentially "LeapFrog" into other high-level communities, similar to "lunch tables on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. To live a rare life, one must be surrounded by rare people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

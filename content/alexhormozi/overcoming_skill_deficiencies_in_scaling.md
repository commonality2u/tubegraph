The concept of [[scaling_the_unscalable_in_business | scaling the unscalable]] is crucial for business success, especially for new or smaller businesses. What often appears "unscalable" is, in reality, a **skill deficiency** rather than a physical impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs leave significant money on the table by not leveraging their largest competitive advantage: the ability to engage in initially unscalable, high-impact activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The "Unscalable" Misconception

Businesses frequently dismiss strategies as "unscalable" because they don't immediately see how they can grow to massive scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. For example, a business doing $30,000 a month through outbound sales might seek a "more scalable acquisition system" because it "requires people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. However, most service businesses scale by hiring and training people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The inability to scale is often due to a lack of know-how, not inherent limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

This misconception is akin to someone wanting to lose weight but fearing they'll get "too bulky" before even starting to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. They focus on an extreme outcome they don't want, preventing them from taking the first necessary steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Similarly, entrepreneurs worry about not being able to hit $100 million a year when they're currently making zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## The Swamp: Lack of Context and Resources

When starting out, businesses typically lack both context and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This absence of help, money, or leverage makes initially unscalable tasks seem impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The business journey often involves a "swamp" where there isn't enough money to hire talent, forcing the founder to work multiple jobs or "management debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This period of working today's job and tomorrow's job is essential to get ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

A prime example is Andy Frisella of First Form, who started by writing handwritten cards to every customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. While this seemed unscalable initially, as the business grew, he first signed the cards, then had others write them, maintaining the personal gesture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This illustrates that a 2.0 or 3.0 version of an unscalable solution can still deliver 80% of the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

## The [[Importance of Skill Development | Importance of Doing the Hard Work]]

Many business owners are unwilling to do the heavy, hard work, such as one-on-one customer calls, because they perceive it as unscalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. However, this early engagement is crucial for:
*   **Learning pain points** customers suffer from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying effective messaging and hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Altering products and offers** to convert at a higher percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

As Paul Graham noted, "You can solve every question and every problem in business by talking to your customer more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Customers know what they want and will guide how to address and advertise to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Even for low-ticket items, directly onboarding customers leads to longer retention, more referrals, and better product and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. The early phase of entrepreneurship is a journey of [[approach_to_learning_selfimprovement_and_mastering_skills | educating yourself on your customer and their problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. The market itself is the best teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### Practical Tips for Customer Interaction

To gain maximum insights from customers:
*   **Magic Question 1:** "If I were to eliminate all of the things that I have in my feature set except for one, what would it be?" This reveals the core value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Magic Question 2 (Inverted):** "If I were to eliminate one thing from my entire feature set and it changed nothing about your life, which one would it be?" This identifies the least valuable aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

Regularly asking these questions allows businesses to cut, trim, and distill their value, maximizing impact for the most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Scaling: From One-on-One to Group

The path to scaling involves a deliberate progression from highly personal interactions to more leveraged models:
1.  **One-on-One:** Start with direct interaction to gain deep customer understanding and refine the offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. The speaker himself learned sales by doing 4,101 closes one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This hands-on experience builds essential skills and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Semi-Private (1-on-6):** Once the core questions and solutions are clear, create a presentation and start doing group sessions. This multiplies output while maintaining a close experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
3.  **Group Onboarding (1-on-20/30):** Further scale by having larger group onboarding sessions, still focusing on setting expectations and delivering promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Companies have scaled to over $100 million annually using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Leverage and Delegation:** As systems become refined (e.g., presentations), teach others to deliver the same content, effectively scaling the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

This progression shows that the "unscalable" work provides the data and processes needed to eventually scale, creating the cash and skill to build leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

## Advantage of the Small Business

Small businesses (under $10 million in revenue) have a unique advantage: they can do things that large corporations cannot, specifically due to their lack of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. They can be more efficient per lead and opportunity by pulling out "all the stops" and offering personalized experiences that a large company couldn't possibly replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. For instance, sending personalized voice notes or videos via iMessage from a personal phone, rather than automated green texts, drastically increases response rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

This "unscalable" personal touch is a competitive advantage that must be exploited in the early stages, like being dealt pocket aces in poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. Use what you have to grow into a "mid-fish" with more resources and reputation, which then provide new advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

## Frameworks for Scaling

Two frameworks can help in this journey:

### 1. Sales to Fulfillment Continuum

This continuum states that generally, the easier something is to sell, the harder it is to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **Easy to Sell:** "Done for you" services (e.g., "I'll do everything for you") are easy to promise but hard to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
*   **Hard to Sell:** "Do it yourself" models are hard to sell but easy to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

Most new businesses incorrectly start with the hardest-to-sell model. The recommended approach is to start with what's easy to sell.

### 2. Done For You, Done With You, Do It Yourself Pyramid (Tesla Model)

This approach suggests starting at the top of the pyramid:
1.  **Done For You (Most Expensive):** Begin with the most expensive, "done for you" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. This is easy to sell and maximizes revenue per customer, especially when customer volume is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. Although it's harder to scale, it allows for developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and productizing the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. This also establishes a strong brand association at the top tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Done With You (Mid-Tier):** Once SOPs are developed from "done for you" clients, transition to a "done with you" consulting relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. This allows for serving more people (e.g., 10 times the amount) at a fraction of the price, as the support required is less intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Do It Yourself (Lowest Tier):** Finally, take the developed SOPs and offer them as a "do it yourself" product, appealing to enterprising customers who want to take things on their own at an even lower price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

This top-down approach ensures operational efficiency, as the number of customers increases as the level of hands-on support decreases. The initial "unscalable" work of "done for you" clients provides the deep knowledge and systems to scale successfully downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.

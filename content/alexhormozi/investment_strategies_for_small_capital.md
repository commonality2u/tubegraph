## The Value of Skills Over Capital
Even if one is "dead broke," possessing skills is paramount for financial recovery and [[wealth_creation_strategies | wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Skills are an inalienable asset that cannot be taken away by governments, individuals, or economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Entrepreneurs can bounce back from "hitting zero" because their skills remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Business Acquisition vs. Home Ownership
When considering [[investment strategies during economic shifts | investment opportunities]] with small capital, such as $50,000, acquiring an existing business can be a more impactful strategy than buying a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Scenario: House Purchase
With $50,000 saved from an annual income of $60,000, one might consider a 10% down payment on a $500,000 house, incurring a significant mortgage liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This approach can be slow to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Scenario: Business Acquisition
Alternatively, the same $50,000 can be used to acquire a profitable business, leading to a much faster increase in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

#### Finding Businesses for Sale
*   **Brokers:** Contact brokers to understand market prices and available businesses in your area, though buying through a broker typically means paying retail price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Direct Approach:** Identify local businesses that align with your interests or expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Unlisted opportunities often exist with motivated sellers who are tired of their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## The Negotiation Strategy: "Agree on Price, Then Agree on Terms"
This powerful negotiation tactic is crucial for [[growing_a_business_without_outside_capital | acquiring assets with minimal or no upfront capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

1.  **Agree on Price:** Determine the purchase price for the business. For example, a business profiting $250,000 annually might be valued at $625,000 (2.5 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  **Agree on Terms:** Once the price is set, negotiate payment terms that reduce your out-of-pocket expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Seller Financing:** Request the seller to finance a significant portion of the deal, such as three-quarters of the price, to be paid over an extended period (e.g., three to five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This means the seller accepts payments over time instead of a large lump sum.
    *   **Bank/SBA Loan:** Secure a loan (e.g., SBA loan) for the remaining portion of the price. Use your available capital as the down payment for this loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Example Application
Using the $625,000 business example:
*   **Seller Finance:** $437,000 (three-quarters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Bank Loan:** $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Your Capital:** $50,000 (as 25% down payment on the bank loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

This strategy allows you to acquire a business making $250,000 annually, significantly upgrading your income from $60,000, with just $50,000 out-of-pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Compared to starting a business from scratch, buying an existing one saves on investment, client acquisition, permits, and other initial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Real-World Example: Gym Acquisition
The speaker applied this "agree on price, then agree on terms" strategy to acquire a gym for $40,000 or $50,000, paying the seller over 12 months with no upfront money out of pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   The gym made $51,000 in sales in the first 30 days, essentially paying for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   This acquisition generated profit monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Later, the gym was sold for 1.5 times the purchase price, demonstrating how a cash-flowing asset was acquired for "nothing" and then profitably exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   This contrasts with earlier ventures where significant capital was invested ($40,000 for the first gym, $250,000 for the second), yielding similar returns to the no-money-down acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Mindset of the Wealthy: Risk Aversion
Wealthy individuals tend to be more risk-averse, understanding that years of good decisions can be undone by a single bad investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. They prioritize guaranteed small returns with no risk over potential huge returns with guaranteed risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This contrasts with people who have less money, who might invest in high-risk ventures like lottery tickets with a high chance of losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

The goal is to acquire assets that "could never go to zero" and, ideally, to acquire them for "zero" cost out-of-pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Conclusion
To succeed with small capital, focus on developing skills, and when making [[investment and company growth strategies | investment decisions]], prioritize acquiring existing businesses with motivated sellers using the "agree on price, then agree on terms" negotiation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This approach, while requiring patience and work ethic, allows for significant financial advancement with very little personal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

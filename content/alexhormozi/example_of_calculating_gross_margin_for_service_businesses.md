Understanding [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] is critical for small and medium-sized business owners, especially those in [[strategies_for_making_money_in_service_businesses | service businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is considered a primary indicator of a business's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Gross Margin vs. Net Margin

*   **[[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | Gross Margin]]**: Represents the direct cost of fulfilling goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It's the [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | revenue]] minus the cost of goods sold (COGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | Net Margin]]**: This is the "juice" at the end of the monthâ€”what's left over after *everything* is paid, representing the final [[importance_of_margin_in_business_profitability | profit]] taken home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | Gross margin]] "begets" or creates the [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margin]], making it a key area of focus for business improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Calculating Gross Margin for Service Businesses

The formula for [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] is straightforward subtraction:
`Gross Margin = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

For a [[strategies_for_making_money_in_service_businesses | service business]], the "cost of goods sold" (COGS) is different from a product-based business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It refers to the *incremental cost* of providing one additional unit of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
This **does not** include:
*   Front desk roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   HR directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Non-essential payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>
*   [[role_of_software_in_service_businesses | Software]] costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>
These are considered overhead costs that come out of the remaining [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] before calculating [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

To express [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] as a percentage:
`Gross Margin Percentage = (Gross Margin / Revenue) * 100` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

### Example 1: Hair Stylist or Trainer

*   **Service Price (Revenue)**: \$60 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: \$20 (what you pay the person performing the service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

1.  **Calculate Gross Margin (dollars)**:
    \$60 (Revenue) - \$20 (COGS) = \$40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

2.  **Calculate Gross Margin Percentage**:
    (\$40 / \$60) \* 100 = 66% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

### The 80% Rule of Thumb

For any [[strategies_for_making_money_in_service_businesses | service-based business]], a target [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] of **80%** or higher is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Moving from 66% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] to 80% can significantly increase [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margins]]. For instance, if a business typically runs 12% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margins]] at 66% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]], achieving 80% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] could lead to 26% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margins]], more than doubling [[revenue_and_profit_calculations | profit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Increments in [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] (e.g., from 80% to 90%, or 90% to 95%) can double the [[importance_of_margin_in_business_profitability | profitability]] of a business because they mean halving the direct costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This allows for serving twice as many people for the same cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Example 2: Coaching Business

A coaching business pays a coach \$4,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This coach can handle 40 clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Clients pay \$1,200 for a three-month package, which equates to \$400 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

1.  **Calculate Total Monthly Revenue**:
    40 clients \* \$400/month = \$16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>

2.  **Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:
    The coach's salary, as they directly fulfill the service for clients: \$4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

3.  **Calculate Gross Margin (dollars)**:
    \$16,000 (Revenue) - \$4,000 (COGS) = \$12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>

4.  **Calculate Gross Margin Percentage**:
    (\$12,000 / \$16,000) \* 100 = 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>

### Why Optimizing Gross Margin Matters

Even a small increase in [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] percentage can lead to significant increases in [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margin]] and overall [[importance_of_margin_in_business_profitability | profitability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. For example, moving from 75% to 80% [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]] can increase [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | net margins]] by 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The two main [[methods_to_increase_gross_margin | methods to increase gross margin]] are:
1.  **Decrease the direct cost** of fulfilling the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, e.g., by paying the coach less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
2.  **Increase the price** charged for the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, e.g., by charging clients more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Higher [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margins]] allow a business to:
*   Cover all other operating expenses (rent, payroll, marketing, [[role_of_software_in_service_businesses | software]], etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   Invest in marketing to acquire more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   Achieve substantial [[importance_of_margin_in_business_profitability | profit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   Enable significant [[scaling_a_servicebased_business | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>

This [[impact_of_margin_optimization_on_business_growth | impact of margin optimization on business growth]] highlights the importance of overcoming any "mental barrier" about charging appropriate prices for services, especially when the direct cost of delivery is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Without adequate [[understanding_gross_margin_versus_net_margin | gross margin]], a business will struggle to generate [[importance_of_margin_in_business_profitability | profit]] and [[scaling_a_servicebased_business | scale]] to help more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Productivity is defined as the amount of money gained for the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A personal transformation from a $0 net worth at age 23 to over $100 million at age 31 was achieved simply by better [[value_of_learning_and_managing_time | investing time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The focus is on achieving good [[importance_of_return_on_time | Returns on time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The core idea, inspired by Paul Graham's blog post from 14 years ago, is that those who are the best [[value_of_learning_and_managing_time | investors of time]] are the ones who make the most money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Two Types of Time Investment Schedules

There are two distinct types of schedules adopted by [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurs]] and workers, and individuals often switch between these "hats" throughout their day or week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### The Manager Schedule

Managers invest their time in the smallest possible chunks, often with 20 or more chunks per day, ranging from 5 to 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. For a manager, an empty time slot is considered a lost opportunity, time that did not yield a [[importance_of_return_on_time | return on investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. They treat time like currency, with the only cost being coordination with others' calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Managers engage in various tasks throughout the day, such as collecting and reporting data, persuading, leading, training, encouraging, and making decisions in one-on-one or group settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Their day typically begins with meeting preparation and ends with the last meeting, meaning the duration of their workday is directly proportional to their meeting schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

The primary objective for a manager is to utilize all their time chunks to maximize their time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. A fully booked [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | day]] is considered a maximally invested and thus productive manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### The Maker Schedule

The maker schedule is less commonly understood but is crucial for creators, [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurs]], and those who build "big things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This schedule is optimized for "deep work"â€”tasks that are not urgent but are incredibly important for long-term progress and business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Examples include coding software, editing videos, or writing books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Unlike managers, makers need few, large chunks of uninterrupted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. A single meeting or interruption can disrupt a several-hour block, making it difficult to re-enter a state of flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the Zeigarnik effect, means that open loops (like upcoming meetings) consume mental energy, sapping a maker's ability to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:17]</a>.

For makers, the output of their work is the actual "stuff" they build, not decisions or coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Makers work *off* meetings and on projects that require extended periods, sometimes weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. They often have a set start time but variable end times, working "open to goal" and allowing themselves to get lost in the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

A maker's typical day might consist of one to three four-to-six-hour chunks, often a morning and a post-lunch block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. For a maker, an empty time slot on their [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] is not a lost opportunity, but *the* opportunity to get a [[importance_of_return_on_time | return]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. An empty [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] is a maximally productive day for a maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## The Conflict: Managers and Makers Interacting

The primary issue arises when managers and makers need to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. A manager who doesn't understand how makers work can inadvertently destroy their team's productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Managers often assume makers can work "on demand" like they do, thinking a 30-minute meeting is insignificant, especially if a maker's [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] appears empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

A short meeting might cost a manager one of their 100+ daily work units, but for a maker, it can consume one of their only two daily time slots, potentially affecting both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. If a maker is falling behind, a manager's solution might be to interrupt them more, creating a vicious cycle where check-ins prevent the very work they are monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

This misunderstanding leads to both parties losing: the manager doesn't get the maker's output, and the maker cannot achieve high [[importance_of_return_on_time | returns on their time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Makers face a difficult choice: offend the manager by declining a meeting (risking relationships and future collaboration) or accept and destroy half their workday for potentially little yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. This cycle can prevent businesses from growing and [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurs]] from progressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

A [[personal_experience_with_productivity | personal belief]] is that being "ruthless" with time, especially maker time, is the highest predictor of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Moving the ball forward daily during maker time is paramount, as 100% of major accomplishments occur during maker time, not manager time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:21]</a>.

## Solutions for Better Time Allocation

A three-pronged approach is necessary to address the conflict between maker and manager schedules, involving managers, makers, and the organization as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

### For Managers

1.  **Understand the Cost to Makers**: Managers must recognize that scheduling a meeting costs a maker twice: first during coordination and then during the meeting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. A meeting costs a maker approximately 10 times more in terms of lost productivity chunks compared to a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. Meetings, especially ad-hoc ones, should only be scheduled if truly essential and if they cannot wait for a set communication cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Value a Maker's "No"**: Managers should not take offense if a maker declines a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. This "maker's no" indicates they are prioritizing larger commitments to the company by focusing on meaningful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. If a meeting is truly critical, the manager should frame it as such and allow the maker time to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Ask for Ideal Workdays**: Managers should inquire about what an ideal, maximally productive day looks like for their team members and aim to accommodate those preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. For instance, a media team might bundle all meetings into specific times, leaving the rest of the days free for deep work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. This can also allow managers to reduce their own meeting load and focus on [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | leading, directing, and training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. Much work doesn't need to be done simultaneously; what matters is completion by a deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

### For Makers

1.  **Communicate Your Work Style**: Makers should proactively inform their managers and teammates about their work style and how they achieve productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. While some meetings are unavoidable, makers can adapt by switching to a manager schedule for that specific block, stacking as many ad-hoc meetings as possible into that interrupted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. The goal is for the [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] to reflect the nature of the work, rather than identifying strictly as one type or the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Establish Standard Meeting Times**: Makers should designate specific days or blocks, such as Monday and Thursday afternoons, as their accepted meeting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. This allows them to push most meeting requests into these blocks, significantly increasing their [[importance_of_return_on_time | returns on time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. It's also wise to leave some empty slots within these designated meeting times for inevitable ad-hoc requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Early-Stage [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | Entrepreneur]] (V1)**: In the early stages, makers might need to utilize nights, weekends, and early mornings for their deep work, as their time may not yet be protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. This was crucial for building foundational assets and systems as a gym owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Intermediate [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | Entrepreneur]] (V2)**: As [[value_of_learning_and_managing_time | time]] becomes more valuable, a 50/50 split might emerge, with the first half of the day dedicated to maker work and the second half for manager tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. Scheduling meetings "back to front" (from the end of the day backward) helps preserve large, uninterrupted morning blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Advanced [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | Entrepreneur]] (V3)**: The most optimized approach involves dedicating entire days to maker work (e.g., 2-4 days a week) and then stacking all meetings, introductions, and coordination on a single manager day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. This ensures that even on manager days, the individual is maximally productive in that specific mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.
3.  **Communicate Responsiveness**: Inform others when you will be slow to respond, particularly during maker blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. People adapt well to clear expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.
4.  **Actually Work**: When granted the respect of protected maker time, makers must utilize it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. Failing to do so can confirm managers' suspicions that empty calendars equate to idleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>. Makers should also be self-aware; on days when creative energy is low, it might be beneficial to schedule meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>.

### For Organizations

1.  **Implement Mandated Quiet Time**: Organizations should consider mandating specific "quiet times" on the [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] where entire teams cannot message or meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. This can be daily periods or full days (e.g., Wednesdays being a quiet day for editing teams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>. This applies to teams with makers like engineers, developers, copywriters, and editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Remote Work Considerations**: In remote settings, where direct observation of work isn't possible, mandated quiet times are even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. Organizations must foster trust and measure output over constant check-ins, allowing longer periods of trust for project completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Relinquish Control and Extend Trust**: As businesses grow, [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurs]] must learn to relinquish control to gain freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. This involves extending trust with guard rails and measuring people on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. Leaders should regularly audit meetings, questioning if they are necessary or if a process/person can replace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>.
    *   Quarterly reviews of recurring meetings to delete or combine them, and advising individuals if their attendance is not essential, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>. A culture where employees feel empowered to leave meetings if they are not adding or gaining value returns time to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>.
    *   Meetings have a significant monetary cost based on attendees' salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>. Organizations often spend significant amounts on unnecessary meetings, preventing higher [[importance_of_return_on_time | returns on time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:00">[35:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Standardize Language and Educate**: Spread this content to both makers and managers to establish a common language for describing this source of waste and preventing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. Companies that implement a maker/manager schedule, where everyone understands how to achieve the highest [[importance_of_return_on_time | returns on their time]], will gain a competitive advantage through higher [[importance_of_return_on_time | returns on human capital]], increased output, and improved work quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>. Actively removing makers and unnecessary managers from meetings is key to this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>.

Managers wearing a "manager hat" might have a [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | schedule]] that is inverted compared to a leader like Alex Hormozi, who has four maker days and one manager day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. The key is understanding which style is best for a particular moment, as most individuals have elements of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. The goal is to articulate this concept to empower makers and help managers understand the true cost of interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>
> [!NOTE] Alex Hormozi's Calendar Example
> A personal [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | calendar]] during a "short week" (following a holiday) shows three full maker days and one manager day.
> *   **Maker Days (e.g., Wednesday, Thursday, Friday):** These days are largely empty of external meetings, dedicated to deep work like recording videos. Internal "gym meetings" are personal appointments. These are designated "quiet days" organization-wide for makers.
> *   **Manager Day (e.g., Tuesday):** This day is densely packed with back-to-back meetings: team meetings, one-on-ones with leaders, executive meetings, book manager meetings, customer calls, and marketing meetings. The aim is to consolidate all coordination and decision-making here, constantly auditing if meetings are necessary or can be automated.

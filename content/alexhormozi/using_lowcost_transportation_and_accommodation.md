To achieve significant financial goals and invest in personal growth, it is crucial to understand how to [[living_frugally_to_save_and_invest | live cheaply]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. This approach allows individuals to save money for business ventures or to invest in skills and experiences that will generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:02">[03:09:02]</a>. The speaker, who managed to live on $1,500 a month while earning $15,000-$20,000, attributes this to being risk-averse and wanting capital for future offensive moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Three major cost centers to address are transportation, living, and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. This article focuses on strategies for transportation and accommodation.

## Transportation: Mosey Mobiles

The most efficient way to own a vehicle is to purchase a used car in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
It is recommended to buy a used four-door vehicle that is ideally between 5 and 10 years old, which can often be found for around $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This eliminates car payments, leaving only car insurance, which is less expensive for cheaper vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Your Vehicle
Possessing a four-door vehicle (15 years or younger, no visible damage) enables flexible income generation through services like Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. This offers immediate earning potential with minimal risk beyond the vehicle itself, allowing individuals to work flexible hours and even combine apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This strategy contributes to the ability to live cheaply and maintain a higher risk tolerance for entrepreneurial endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

## Accommodation: Mosey Mansions

Finding low-cost accommodation is critical for reducing monthly expenses. The speaker lived in Southern California, one of the most expensive markets, demonstrating extreme measures to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Cheap Living
*   **Sleeping at a business/gym:** Initially, the speaker slept on the floor of their gym, which technically cost $0 for personal use but was part of the $5,000/month business rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Free accommodation:** Leveraging connections to find temporary free places to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Splitting a room:** The speaker paid $400 a month to split a single bedroom in a seven-bedroom house, sharing the room with another person, and sleeping on a Craigslist mattress on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This environment was challenging, with multiple couples and dogs, but provided a low-cost option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Strategic Location and Networking
While living in cheaper areas like North Carolina or Boise, Idaho, might allow for a $400 room without splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, it is recommended to consider living in areas where significant opportunities and growth are occurring, even if it means a higher cost or more restrictive living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Being around people:** Being in environments with driven individuals can inspire and accelerate personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Online communities:** Connect with like-minded individuals through Discord, Facebook groups, or other online communities to find pockets of people with similar goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Networking:** The speaker moved strategically to be around people they wanted to learn from, emphasizing that handshakes and connections open more doors than "hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Always accept a first invite to dinner or a meeting, and prepare by researching the person and bringing something valuable to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Providing value:** Offer significant value to others without expecting immediate returns. This builds "IOUs" that can be cashed in when making future moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

## Financial Discipline and Mindset

[[importance_of_reducing_expenses_to_improve_financial_situation | Reducing expenses]] increases risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Avoiding unnecessary spending, like expensive cars or club outings, frees up capital that can be used for education or investments to increase earning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

### Gamifying Finances
*   **Competitive spending:** Become competitive with yourself about how little you can spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.
*   **Cash envelope method:** Use a physical wallet for your monthly spending money, and do not exceed that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. This emphasizes financial discipline over credit card rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Daily bank account checks:** Make checking your bank account the first thing you do every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This builds awareness of money flow and can encourage positive financial behavior, similar to daily weighing for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **Tracking balances:** Maintain a Google Sheet to record your daily bank balance. This allows you to track personal records and long-term trends, providing positive reinforcement for sacrifices made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. Over 90 days, this habit can significantly improve your financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

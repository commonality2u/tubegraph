Advertising is the process of making known, allowing strangers to discover the products or services a business sells. If more people are aware of what you sell, you will sell more, leading to increased revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The ability to generate leads provides endless opportunities for a business to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10">[08:10]</a>.

The strategies for getting leads are versatile and applicable across various industries, including Real Estate, medical, auto, homeowners insurance, healthcare, local businesses, home services, financial services, consumer services, software apps, e-learning, e-commerce, and any venture that involves selling products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These strategies are proven through their use in portfolio companies across software, local business, e-commerce, consumer services, medical services, professional services, and home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Core Four Advertising Methods

There are four primary ways to let others know about your offerings, often referred to as the "Core Four" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>:
1.  Warm Outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>
2.  Posting Free Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>
3.  [[Running paid advertisements | Running Paid Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>
4.  Cold Outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>

### 1. Warm Outreach

Warm Outreach involves directly contacting people who already know you on a one-to-one basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This method is reliable, low-risk, repeatable, and low-cost, making it ideal for getting initial customers with a zero-dollar budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

**Platforms and Methods for Warm Outreach:**
*   Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   Phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   Direct messages (DMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   Physical mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   Voicemails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   Carrier pigeons (a metaphorical inclusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>

Platforms where warm outreach can be executed include Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), TikTok, and through traditional email and phone systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. This method can be scaled from getting a business's first five customers to launching new products within a division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content

Posting free content involves creating and distributing valuable material to your audience on a one-to-many basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. This approach naturally grows an audience, leading to more potential buyers and positively impacting all other lead generation methods by building trust and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. A key strategy for content is the "Hook, Retain, Reward" framework, which maximizes the likelihood of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

**Platforms for Posting Free Content:**
*   YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   YouTube Longs (longer videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   Podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   SiriusXM Radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>

*   TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   Instagram stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   Instagram reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   Instagram posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>

This method can be scaled from one post a week to 250 posts a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

### 3. Running Paid Ads

[[Running paid advertisements | Running paid advertisements]] involves letting strangers know about your offerings on a one-to-many basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Paid ads are described as the closest thing to legally printing money because they consistently work and can be scaled by increasing spending rather than time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. They do not require an existing audience or reputation to start, and campaigns can begin with as little as a few dollars a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. [[effective_ad_creation_and_optimization_techniques | Ads]] are made simple by following frameworks like the "What, Who, When" framework for scripting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:58">[02:19:58]</a>.

*   Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>
*   Podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>

Businesses can spend over a million dollars per week on ads across their portfolio, demonstrating the scalability of this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

### 4. Cold Outreach

Cold Outreach involves privately reaching out to people who do not know you on a one-to-one basis, effectively advertising to strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This method is effective even without being on camera or creating extensive content, and it allows for operating in secrecy as competitors won't know what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. With sufficient volume, it becomes incredibly reliable and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:22">[02:48:22]</a>. Businesses can choose highly qualified, perfect-fit targets for outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>.

**Platforms and Methods for Cold Outreach:**
*   SMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Direct Messages (DMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   LinkedIn messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Instagram messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Twitter messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Voicemail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Physical mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>
*   Carrier pigeons (a metaphorical inclusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>

This method allows for starting with a tiny budget, requiring only time, a way to contact people, and knowing what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:44">[02:43:44]</a>. It can be scaled using other people's time and automation, with portfolios generating over 15,000 reach-outs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>.

## Leveraging Lead Getters

While an individual can utilize the Core Four methods, there are other ways to advertise through "Lead Getters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>. These include:
*   Customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>: Your customers can tell other people about your stuff using warm outreach, leading to more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>.
*   Employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>: Employees can execute the Core Four methods on your behalf, such as creating content for events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>: Agencies can post content, run ads, or conduct outreach on your behalf, effectively managing advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   Affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>: Independent businesses (affiliates) can tell their audience to buy your stuff, often through their own content or advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>.

The most efficient way to advertise is to have others do it on your behalf, as there are more of them than there are of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This significantly increases leverage, allowing for more leads with less personal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

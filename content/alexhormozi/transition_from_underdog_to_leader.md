The transition from an "underdog" status to a position of leadership and success often brings unforeseen social challenges, even when met with initial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This shift can be a significant aspect of the [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | challenges of becoming successful]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Shifting Perceptions of Success

Initially, individuals striving for success often receive encouragement. For instance, a business guru who slept in his gym while personal training was supported by his trainees, who expressed hopes for his business to "take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

However, once success is achieved—such as the guru owning the gym and managing operations—the perception of those who once offered support can change dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The supportive attitude transforms into a questioning one, challenging the newfound authority and work ethic of the successful individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a common hurdle in [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | overcoming societal and personal challenges to achieve success]].

### Personal Reflections on the Transition

A similar pattern was observed when an individual, like Sam (presumably Sam Sulek), experienced rapid, almost overnight success, becoming a professional bodybuilder and achieving YouTube prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Those who previously wished him well eventually reacted differently once he achieved his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

This experience was so difficult that it prompted the speaker to write an essay titled "Everyone believes in the American dream until it comes true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The core question explored was: "At what point do you go from being the underdog to the man?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The essay identified a crucial observation:

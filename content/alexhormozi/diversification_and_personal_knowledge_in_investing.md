The economic landscape underwent a significant shift in 2022, prompting a re-evaluation of investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This shift led to changes in asset pricing, inflationary pressures, and downturns in real estate, crypto, and stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. As a result, the speaker, who crossed $100 million in net worth at 33 years old, adapted their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Rethinking Cash Holdings

Historically, many people keep cash in traditional bank accounts. However, this is seen as suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When cash is deposited, the bank actually takes it as a loan from the depositor, making the depositor a creditor of the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Banks then loan this money out, either to the government by buying bonds or to individuals for mortgages, earning a higher return than they pay depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For instance, banks might pay depositors 0.1% to 1% annually, while earning 4% from the government, thus making 40 times what they pay out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A critical factor in lending is the likelihood of getting the money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. If a bank fails, funds exceeding the FDIC insured amount are at risk, and the FDIC itself is described as being in a precarious financial state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### An Alternative: US Treasuries

To address the limitations of traditional bank accounts, the speaker opted for US Treasuries as a "bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This approach offers a better alternative due to lower risk and higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The U.S. government is considered less likely to default than a commercial bank because it can print money to pay back its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, and it typically offers better returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Additionally, one can take loans against Treasuries for up to 80% of their value while still earning interest on the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Strategy

The speaker's [[importance_of_understanding_investments_for_wealth_growth | investment strategy]] evolved through several phases:

1.  **Early Life (SME 500)**: The initial focus was on [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | investing in personal and financial growth]]. All excess cash was directed towards [[investing_in_selfeducation_and_skills_development | learning skills]], gaining access to influential people, coaching, mentorships, and workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This was considered the highest return investment made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This phase represents [[the_role_of_longterm_investment_in_personal_growth | longterm investment in personal growth]] and [[investing_in_personal_growth_and_mentorship | personal growth and mentorship]].
2.  **S&P 500**: Once funds exceeded what could be reinvested in personal development, the speaker began investing in the S&P 500, following Warren Buffett's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
3.  **Post-Company Sale**: After selling three companies, a "barbell strategy" was adopted, involving investments in stocks, real estate, and private equities of owned companies, with little in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, despite having significant cash, only a small percentage (around 10%) was deployed over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Revelation: Investing Where Your Knowledge Lies

A pivotal insight came from a video featuring Dave Ramsey analyzing Graham Stefan's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Graham Stefan, with over 80% of his net worth in real estate, questioned if he was "over indexed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Dave Ramsey responded by suggesting that an ideal investment distribution should reflect one's knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. If 80-85% of one's knowledge is in real estate, then an 80-85% allocation to real estate is a "perfect distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Ramsey shared two key lessons learned from numerous billionaires:
1.  They don't do many things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
2.  The things they choose are what they understand, and they do a lot of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

This implies that the wealthiest individuals focus heavily on one or two areas they know exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Applying the Insight to Personal Strategy

This insight changed the speaker's perspective, highlighting that his previous "barbell strategy" was a friend's strategy, not his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. He realized his expertise lay in service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Quoting Warren Buffett, "It's only risky if you don't know what you're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The advice to invest in the S&P 500 is often given to those who don't know what they're doing, as it provides broad diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, outsized returns come from playing a "game where you have an unfair advantage," knowing more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The speaker now feels comfortable making sizable private deals in areas he understands, as he can identify and assess the [[understanding_risk_in_investments | risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## A Focused Investment Strategy

The refined investment strategy emphasizes a singular focus, mirroring a successful business approach:
1.  [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | Invest in yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
2.  Invest excess capital in indexes (like the S&P 500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Once you become highly proficient in your core area of expertise, deploy stockpiled capital into private deals within that area, initiating a compounding machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The overall [[investment_strategies_during_economic_shifts | investment strategy]] now aligns with a business strategy of singular focus: "do the things you know, do more, do it better, and keep doing that for an extended period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

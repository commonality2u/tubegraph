When developing pricing strategies, it is crucial to [[identifying_and_serving_the_ideal_customer | understand customer segmentation]] to maximize revenue and meet diverse market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:99">[05:24:99]</a>. Different customer segments derive varying levels of value from a product or service, necessitating varied pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:99">[05:40:99]</a>.

## Pricing Based on Value Delivered
The price of a product or service should reflect the value it delivers to a specific customer "avatar" or segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:99">[05:40:99]</a>. For instance, a service sold to Coca-Cola will be more valuable to them than to a local brewery, allowing for different pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:99">[05:43:99]</a>.

Consider a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) expert:
*   If they help an e-commerce store making $1 million annually increase sales by 10%, that's an additional $100,000 in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:99">[05:54:99]</a>.
*   If the same expert helps a store doing $100 million annually achieve the same 10% increase, the value delivered is $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:99">[05:58:99]</a>.
The value provided to the customer is directly proportional to who they are, not solely based on the provider's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:99">[06:03:99]</a>. This principle supports [[defining_value_and_pricing_strategies | defining value and pricing strategies]] and allows for higher pricing for higher-value customers.

## Meeting Buying Personas
A common mistake in pricing is having narrow price ranges, such as $100, $110, and $120 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:99">[05:27:99]</a>. Instead, businesses should aim to meet diverse buying personas with broader price points, like $100, $200, and $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:99">[05:32:99]</a>. This is because the needs and financial capabilities of customers differ significantly across these tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:99">[05:37:99]</a>.

## The "Whale" Customer Segment
There's a specific segment of the population, often referred to as "whales," who consistently purchase the most expensive available option because "that's who they are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:99">[04:43:99]</a>. Having a very expensive, premium offering (10x, 50x, or even 100x the price of your main product) on your menu does not negatively impact your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:99">[04:46:99]</a>.

This [[strategies_for_premium_pricing | strategy for premium pricing]] has two key benefits:
1.  **Price Anchoring**: The extremely high price [[anchoring_tactic_in_pricing_strategies | anchors the perception of value]] for other offerings, making them appear more affordable by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:99">[01:43:99]</a>. For example, if a $100,000 "gold" package is offered alongside a $10,000 "silver" package, the $10,000 option seems like a great deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:99">[05:18:99]</a>.
2.  **Attracting High-Value Buyers**: A certain percentage of customers will buy the most expensive option regardless of the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:99">[04:43:99]</a>. This [[selling_to_wealthy_customers_vs_mass_markets | selling to wealthy customers vs mass markets]] approach can lead to unexpected sales of high-ticket items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:99">[04:50:99]</a>.

When setting these high prices, aim for a reaction of surprise or a "gasp" from potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:99">[04:54:99]</a>. This indicates that you've pushed past their expected price range, "breaking the rubber band of pricing" they had associated with your products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:99">[04:57:99]</a>. After presenting the anchor, you can then explain the exceptional value, and customers will be more open to considering other, seemingly more reasonable, options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:99">[05:07:99]</a>.

By understanding and segmenting customers, businesses can effectively [[using_tiered_pricing_to_influence_buyer_behavior | use tiered pricing to influence buyer behavior]] and capture different levels of value.

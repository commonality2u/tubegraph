To achieve success and impress your future self, it's essential to adopt a specific [[effective_habits_and_mindset_strategies | mindset]] and approach to actions, learning, and personal growth. The goal is not to impress others, but rather to win for "future you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This framework applies to any area of life, including health, relationships, business, sales, real estate, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## What to Do: The Power of Inversion

Winning starts with understanding what leads to losing and then doing the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This "inversion" process leverages the brain's natural ability to identify problems more easily than solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Identifying What Not to Do
Imagine the "least successful version" of yourself and list the actions they would take or not take to guarantee failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Examples of behaviors that lead to losing include:
*   Being impatient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Showing up late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Being unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Lacking confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   Being transactional rather than relational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   Not following up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Not advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   Not asking for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

The more concise this "lose" list is, the more potent its inverted counterpart becomes, often serving as a "north star" for how to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## How to Do It: Breaking Down Skills and Building Confidence

Many people struggle not because they don't know *what* to do, but because they don't know *how* to do it, often due to a lack of detailed breakdown of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Operationalizing Actions
Skills and actions need to be broken down to their most basic, observable form. A highly skilled person can follow a general command, but a less skilled individual needs every step articulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If there's one "broken link" in a chain of instruction, progress halts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

To operationalize means to explain using actions or behaviors that can be seen, rather than feelings, thoughts, or intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. For example, "being charismatic" can be operationalized into observable actions like:
*   Smiling when people walk in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   Changing emphasis and tonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>
*   Remembering names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
*   Asking about people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
*   Maintaining eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   Addressing everyone in a room when entering and exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

If you can learn something, it's a skill, and if it's a skill, it can be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Traits like "charismatic" are simply shorthand for groups of smaller, learnable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Learning, Intelligence, and Confidence
*   **Learning**: Occurs when, under the same condition, you exhibit a new behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. If you don't change your behavior in the same situation, you haven't learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Intelligence**: Defined as the rate of learning, or how fast you change what you do in the same situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Confidence**: The percentage likelihood that something will happen, built through repeated proof of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Confidence is domain-specific; practicing a skill repeatedly in its actual context builds true confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | Confidence comes from the past, not the present]] â€“ preparation happens *before* the skill is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. If your plan requires luck, it's a bad plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Why to Do It: Overcoming External and Internal Barriers

### External Conditions: The Five Stages of Opportunity Hopping
Many individuals fall into a cycle of "opportunity hopping" instead of sticking with a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This cycle includes:
1.  **Uninformed Optimism**: Excitement based on superficial observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
2.  **Informed Pessimism**: Realization that the task is harder than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
3.  **Valley of Despair**: Questioning purpose and justifying quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Most people jump to a new opportunity here, restarting the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
4.  **Informed Optimism**: Understanding the process, breaking it into actionable steps, and committing to a feedback cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
5.  **Win**: Achieving success through persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

Sticking with things yields compounding returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Wealth is often made during hard times because the market consolidates to the few who remain persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. [[delaying_gratification_for_greater_outcomes | "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Hard times are opportunities to gain proof of who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. What makes you extraordinary is not *what* you do, but *how long* you are willing to do it for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

### Internal Conditions: Motivation from Deprivation
Motivation stems from deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. When you're hungry or thirsty, you're motivated to eat or drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. With money, deprivation is psychological, not physiological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. You only feel "poor" or deprived if you perceive a large gap between your current situation and where you want to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

Changing your environment and who you compare yourself to can stretch this gap, increasing your sense of deprivation and thus your motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Your environment sets your standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. To leverage this, [[mindset_changes_for_achieving_financial_goals | compare yourself to the person you generally want to become]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Who You Need to Become: Identity Through Action

Contrary to some popular beliefs, "being" and "identities" are simply descriptions of what we *do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. As Aristotle said, "We are what we repeatedly do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Therefore, the phrase "Be, Do, Have" can be simplified to just "Do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. By doing what a certain type of person does, you become that person and achieve the results of those actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

The work you put in shapes who you become: "The work works on you more than you work on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. A new identity comes with new [[setting_priorities_for_success | priorities]] and a shift in how you allocate resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. To be number one, simply do what the number one version of yourself would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

## When to Start: Now

There are three common reasons people delay starting:
1.  **Season/External Timing**: Believing the current economic climate or life stage isn't ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. However, the best time to change behavior is when you are busiest, so that the change endures even when life gets hectic again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
2.  **Hour by Hour (Lack of Time)**: Feeling there isn't enough time in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. This often means you're doing the wrong things. The first step to correcting course is elimination, not addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. If you're busy and broke, you're not smart with your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. People who achieve goals faster are more leveraged; they get more for what they put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
3.  **The "When-Then" Fallacy**: Believing "when I have more time, I'll do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This inverts the sequence. You *do* now to *get* later; you don't *get* in order to *do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

The moment you want to be the future version of yourself is when you should start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. If identity is based on action, then the moment you begin doing what future you does, you *are* that person, even if the proof takes time to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

Measure success by whether you completed the actions, making failure unreasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. The greatest games in life, like marriage or business, are about outlasting, not winning a single event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>. This shifts winning to a decision you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. "Everything must be hard before it can be easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. The hard times are opportunities to give yourself proof that you can overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Focus on the activities, not internal feelings, to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

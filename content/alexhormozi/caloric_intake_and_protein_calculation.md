This article outlines a straightforward, flexible approach to diet and fitness that has allowed the speaker to maintain a six-pack for 20 years, even while eating dessert nightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method is based on personal experience rather than being the most scientifically researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, and many entrepreneurs who have adopted it have seen success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The core of the approach involves determining caloric and protein needs, then using the remaining calories flexibly, making it easier for [[maintaining_fitness_with_simple_nutrition | maintaining fitness with simple nutrition]] and [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexible eating]].

## Step 1: Determine Your Goal

The first step is to identify your fitness objective: whether you are trying to get bigger or get smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Step 2: Calculate Daily Caloric Intake

To determine your daily caloric intake, use a coefficient system ranging from 7 to 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These coefficients correspond to different goals:
*   Extreme Weight Loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Moderate Weight Loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Moderate Weight Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Extreme Weight Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

You multiply your body weight by the chosen coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Example for Moderate Cut

For a 200 lb individual aiming for a moderate cut, the speaker uses a coefficient of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   200 lbs (body weight) \* 10 (coefficient) = 2,000 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

This calculation accounts for exercise or physical jobs; if you lose weight too quickly, you can adjust the coefficient (e.g., from 10 to 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This method is part of [[caloriefocused_dietary_strategies | calorie-focused dietary strategies]].

## Step 3: Calculate Daily Protein Intake

Next, calculate your daily protein intake by multiplying your body weight by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Example for Protein

For a 200 lb individual:
*   200 lbs (body weight) \* 1 = 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

The speaker emphasizes that roughly one pound of lean meat (like white fish, ground turkey breast, ground beef, or shrimp) contains about 100 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Therefore, 200 grams of protein would require about 2 pounds of meat if it were your exclusive [[protein_consumption_in_diet | protein consumption in diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The speaker personally tends to eat more than 1 gram per pound because protein is filling and makes him feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Step 4: Allocate Remaining Calories

This is considered the "magic" step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. After calculating your total calorie goal and protein needs, you determine the calories associated with your chosen protein sources.

### Example for Remaining Calories

If you aim for 2,000 total calories and need 200 grams of protein (equivalent to 2 pounds of turkey at 560 calories per pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:
*   2 lbs of turkey = 1,120 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   2,000 (total calories) - 1,120 (calories from protein) = 880 calories remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

These remaining calories can be used flexibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For instance, you could have cocktails and a 500-calorie meal at a business dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, or a whole pint of ice cream (880 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, or two 400-calorie cookies for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This flexibility allows for [[balancing_dessert_and_fitness | balancing dessert and fitness]].

For maintenance, the speaker uses a coefficient of 15 (e.g., 200 lbs \* 15 = 3,000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, which provides even more caloric flexibility.

## Daily Meal Structure Example

The speaker follows a consistent breakfast and lunch routine to hit protein targets, allowing for flexibility at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This provides a framework for [[highprotein_recipes | high-protein recipes]] and [[easy_protein_snacks | easy protein snacks]].

*   **Breakfast**: A 200-calorie bar (e.g., Quest Bar) with 20g protein, and a shake with 30g protein and 160 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Total for breakfast: 360 calories, 50g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This is an example of [[proteinrich_breakfast_options | protein-rich breakfast options]].
*   **Lunch**: One pound of turkey (560 calories) and half a cup of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   Total through lunch: 1,140 calories, 150g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Dinner**: This is the "big flex meal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. While the speaker often eats another pound of protein, the remaining calories can be filled with anything, as long as the total calories for the day are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Eating protein keeps the speaker full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The speaker notes that this method has led to significant weight loss for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> and is what he genuinely eats every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. He supplements with a multivitamin for greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

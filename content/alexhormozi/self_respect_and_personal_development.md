The most challenging respect to earn is one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Achieving success, whether it's building a business or reaching personal goals, involves more than just setting external objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It fundamentally ties into who you become through your actions and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Be-Do-Have Framework

Personal growth can be understood through a three-element framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>:
1.  **External Result** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>: The desired outcome, such as making more money or achieving a fitness goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  **Processes, Behaviors, and Activity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>: The work and actions required to achieve the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  **Being the Type of Person** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>: Identifying with the behaviors and embodying the characteristics of someone who naturally performs those actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This "be-do-have" concept highlights that the deepest transformation comes from [[identity_and_personal_transformation | becoming]] the person who naturally does the things that lead to desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Goals vs. Activities

Contrary to popular belief, merely writing down goals is often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Winners and losers frequently share the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. What distinguishes them is the consistent commitment to the activities that drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The goal isn't just the outcome, but the consistent commitment to the activities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. People often know *what* to do but fail to *do it* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## The "What Would This Type of Person Do?" Keystone Habit

A powerful [[foundational_personal_development_for_success | foundational personal development]] tactic is to ask yourself, "What would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This question serves as a mental cue to guide [[decisionmaking_power_and_personal_development | decision-making]] and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Examples of this question include:
*   "What would a wise man do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   "What would a billionaire do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   "What would someone 10 times smarter than me do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   "What would Jesus do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
*   "What would King Solomon do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>
*   "What would Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>

This approach simplifies the process, making it easier than remembering a long checklist of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It addresses unforeseen situations because you embody a certain type of person rather than following a rigid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Identity as a Voting System

Your [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] functions like a voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Every action you take casts a vote for the type of person you aspire to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For example, if you consistently ask "What would a wise man do?" and act accordingly, you are casting votes towards becoming a wiser person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The word "identity" itself means "repeated beingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Your actions literally shape who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. While affirmations (e.g., "I am a lion") on their own are largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, coupling them with action provides the necessary evidence to reinforce your desired [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> "We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught. Most people know they should be doing more than they're currently doing in order to achieve their goals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>

The key to [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | sustained growth]] and achieving extraordinary results is to consistently perform "uncommonly obvious" actions for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This is only possible if you are doing it because it aligns with who you *are* or who you *are becoming*, rather than solely for an external outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Focusing on the internal shift of [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] allows for long-lasting, deep change that eventually feels effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

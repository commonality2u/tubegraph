Achieving specific financial targets, such as an [[business_valuation_and_enterprise_value | enterprise value]] of $100 million, can be done with "any business" without needing to invent complex technologies [00:00:21]. For comparison, aiming for $100 billion would necessitate creating something on the scale of the next Google [00:00:15].

## Setting Financial Targets

To build a business worth $100 million, it's essential to determine the required profit [00:00:40]. Given typical industry multiples, a business might need to generate $12-15 million in profit, or $20 million to be safe, to achieve a $100 million valuation [00:00:46].

## Deriving Revenue from Profit Goals

Once the target profit is established, the necessary revenue can be calculated using average net margins. For instance, if the target profit is $20 million and the industry average net margin is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, the business would need to achieve $100 million in annual revenue [00:00:52].

This annual revenue can then be broken down into smaller, actionable targets:
*   **Monthly Revenue:** $100 million annually translates to approximately $8.3 million per month [00:00:54].
*   **Weekly Revenue:** This is roughly $2 million per week [00:00:57].
*   **Daily Revenue:** Dividing the weekly goal by seven days yields a daily target of $300,000 [00:01:01].

## Applying to a Business Model: House Cleaning Example

Consider a house cleaning business as an example to illustrate these calculations:
*   **Customer Retention:** The average customer stays for 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Monthly Payment:** Customers typically pay $400 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Net Margins:** The industry average for net margins is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

By knowing the daily revenue target (e.g., $300,000), one can then "back in [[sales_velocity_and_daily_revenue_goals | sales velocity]]" based on the customer's [[key_sales_metrics_and_their_impact | Lifetime Value (LTV)]] to meet that daily goal [00:01:05].

## The Business Model Derivation Process

The general process for deriving a business model based on financial targets involves these steps:
1.  Determine the daily sales required [00:01:15].
2.  Calculate the worth of each sale (e.g., customer LTV) [00:01:15].
3.  Project the total revenue this will generate [00:01:17].
4.  Assess the margin on that revenue [00:01:19].
5.  Apply the appropriate multiple to that margin to determine the business's potential valuation [00:01:21].

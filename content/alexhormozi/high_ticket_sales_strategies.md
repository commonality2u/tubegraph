Alex Hormozi, founder of Gym Launch, is recognized as a leading internet marketer in the fitness industry, with Russell Brunson of ClickFunnels calling him the best sales guy he knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Hormozi's businesses have achieved significant financial success, reaching over $100 million in sales with a remarkable 36-to-1 lifetime return on advertising spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. His approach to sales emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and deep conviction in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Core Sales Philosophy

Hormozi believes in a simple sales process that yields significant returns, especially when [[selling_highvalue_products_and_services|selling expensive stuff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The key is to focus on making more per customer through efficient conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This strategy allows businesses to afford more leads and grow faster, as seen when transitioning from selling trials to selling high-value items on the front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## The CLOSER Framework

The CLOSER framework is a systematic approach to [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals|closing deals]] that works for both B2C and B2B, and for products ranging from $500 to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. It's designed to guide prospects to a "yes" by hitting specific milestones.

*   **C - Clarify why the person is on the phone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>: Understand their objective, their goal, and the problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This step is crucial; if the problem isn't clarified, don't ask for the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **L - Label the problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>: Reiterate what you understand to be their goal and problem, ensuring they acknowledge and own it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **O - Overview their past attempts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>: Ask what they've tried, how long they tried it, and how it worked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This process, called the "pain cycle," generates "ammo" for the close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Crucially, explain how their past failures were not their fault, but due to a missing piece of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **S - Sell the Vacation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>: Instead of describing the product's features (the "plane flight"), sell the end result or transformation (the "vacation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The pitch should be short, ideally no longer than three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Prospects buy because they feel understood, not because of jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Sales calls should consist of only three types of communication:
    1.  Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>
    2.  Restatements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>
    3.  Anecdotal stories (to break beliefs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>
*   **E - Explain away their concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>: Address common objections like [[pricing_strategies_for_highticket_items|price]], needing to consult a decision-maker, or needing to "think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Memorize responses to these obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. People often stall due to fear of making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
    *   **Three Core Questions for Decision:**
        1.  "Do you feel like what we're doing can meet your needs and solve the problem?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>
        2.  "Do you want to work with us as a company? Do you like our values, what we stand for, what we believe?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>
        3.  "Do you have access to funds or know someone who does?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>
*   **R - Reinforce the decision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>: The sale continues throughout the customer relationship. Reinforce the decision through personalized videos, handwritten cards, and consistent follow-up to ensure continued belief and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## The Conviction Framework

Conviction in the product can make any salesperson outperform a seasoned veteran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. If you believe in the product, you won't need to have all the [[enhancing_sales_skills_through_low_ticket_transactions|sales skills]] because you will genuinely want to help the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. This deep belief enables one to "sell hard" ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.

*   **Tactics for Cultivating Conviction:**
    *   **Read testimonials out loud daily:** If a business lacks testimonials, find another business to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
    *   **Continuously improve the product:** Fix everything possible and never blame a customer for lack of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Take responsibility for making the next person successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
    *   **Inner conviction:** The drive to put in the work to truly merit the price charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. Salespeople burn out from internal guilt, not external rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
    *   **Be an evangelist:** When you become a "disciple" of your product, [[effective_use_of_scripts_in_sales|scripting]] becomes less critical because your belief drives your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. The most convicted person will always win the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>, as belief is a spectrum, not binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Sales Training and [[Sales team scaling strategies|Scaling Sales Teams]]

To [[sales_team_scaling_strategies|scale sales teams]] and duplicate [[enhancing_sales_skills_through_low_ticket_transactions|sales skills]] in others, consistent training is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Alex Hormozi's teams practice 60 minutes a day, five days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

*   **Daily Training Schedule:**
    *   First 25 minutes: Read the [[effective_use_of_scripts_in_sales|script]] out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
    *   Five minutes: Draw obstacles (e.g., "I need to think about it," "I need to talk to my partner," "This is expensive") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
    *   Second half: Practice active listening by reviewing call recordings to identify what went right or wrong, and plan for the next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

When training salespeople, the focus should be on understanding the *prospect*, not just the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. If a salesperson misarticulates the prospect's problem, the product's effectiveness becomes irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

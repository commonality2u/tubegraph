From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

Living frugally and strategically managing finances can lead to significant savings and opportunities for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The speaker shares his personal experience of living on $1,500 a month while earning between $15,000 and $20,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach was driven by a risk-averse nature and a desire to accumulate capital for future "offensive" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He viewed his substantial income as a stepping stone to larger goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Understanding how to live cheaply is crucial for [[steps_to_achieve_financial_independence | building a business]] and [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | investing in skills and experiences]] that generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This [[smart_money_management_techniques | financial discipline]] increases one's risk tolerance, as there are fewer financial burdens to worry about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The ultimate goal is to maximize both minimal spending and high earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Key Cost Centers for Frugal Living

The speaker focuses on three primary cost centers: food, transportation, and living arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Food (Mosey Meals)

Despite living on $1,500 a month, the speaker managed to eat out every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This was a strategic choice to save time for income generation, as he found cooking and meal prep more time-consuming and less financially sensible than buying food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Popular low-cost options included:
*   **Chipotle**
    *   Eating twice a day cost approximately $15-$20 daily, totaling around $600 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Panda Express**
    *   A "hack" involving extra chicken can provide 110-200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Chick-fil-A**
    *   Purchasing 20-40 packs of chicken nuggets or two sandwiches could keep daily costs around $10-$12, resulting in $600-$700 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Grocery shopping for a single person could cost $150 a week, or $600 a month, similar to these eating out options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Extremely cheap options:** Bread, peanut butter, and multivitamin are the absolute cheapest route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Adding Lactaid milk can provide protein, carbs, and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These can be combined with one "Mosey Meal" for balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Transportation (Mosey Mobiles)

The most cost-effective way to own a vehicle is to purchase a used, 5-10 year old, four-door vehicle in cash for around $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This eliminates car payments, leaving only car insurance, which is less expensive for cheaper cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. After the initial capital expense, transportation costs could be as low as $100 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

A "Plan B" for income involves using this vehicle for Uber or similar flexible work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This provides immediate income, flexibility in hours, and minimal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Living (Mosey Mansions)

The speaker lived in Southern California, an expensive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. His living situation progressed from sleeping in his gym (technically free, though business rent was $5,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> to sleeping at a member's house for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
He eventually split a single bedroom in a seven-bedroom house with a roommate, paying $400 a month for his half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This environment was challenging, with multiple dogs and couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The speaker recommends moving to areas where "shit's happening" and people are active in their lives, even if it costs $200-$400 a month for a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This exposure to higher standards of excellence, though potentially making one feel worse initially, serves as inspiration for what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Being around people who discuss time and money in larger increments (e.g., $100,000 investments, decades instead of weeks) can shift one's own perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## The Importance of Connections and Mentorship

[[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | Investing in personal and financial growth]] also involves strategic relationship building. The speaker emphasizes that "handshakes" and connections have propelled his life faster than "hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Major deals in his life have stemmed from one or two degrees of separation from people he met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Key advice for networking:
*   **Accept the first invite:** Accepting initial invitations to connect significantly increases the likelihood of forming lasting friendships and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Do prep work:** Research the person you are meeting for about 30 minutes and aim to bring something valuable to the table, such as applying your skills to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Provide disproportionate value:** When offering a favor, "blow them away" with the amount of work to the point of making them feel awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | invests in long-term relationships]] that can pay dividends later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Not needing anything back:** The ultimate leverage in a relationship is not needing anything in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This allows one to "stack IOUs" and "load the deck early" so that when a move is needed, there are "blank checks ready to cash in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The time to dig a well is before you are thirsty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Mindset and Habits for Financial Discipline

[[personal_finance_habits_and_strategies | Personal finance habits and strategies]] are critical for success.
*   **Gamify spending:** Try to be competitive with yourself about how little you can spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Cash budgeting:** One effective method is to withdraw the exact amount of cash you plan to spend for the month and stick to that budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Focus on discipline, not credit card hacks:** Chasing small percentages with credit card rewards distracts from the core goal of [[personal_finance_strategies | financial discipline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **[[tracking_finances_daily_to_improve_money_habits | Track finances daily]]**: Make checking your bank account the first priority every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This builds awareness of money flow, similar to how daily weighing helps with weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Awareness improves problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Reward good behavior:** Seeing your bank balance increase provides positive reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Use a Google Sheet:** Record your daily bank balance in a Google Sheet to track personal records and long-term trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This visual progress motivates continued sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Confront financial reality:** Avoiding checking your bank account due to anxiety perpetuates financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Money "sticks to the person who pays it the most attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

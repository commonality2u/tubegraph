The most powerful sales tactic, though learned by accident, revolves around the [[the_importance_of_belief_and_trust_in_sales | importance of belief and trust in sales]] and the seller's underlying intention. This method, detailed in the upcoming *100 Million Dollar Sales Book*, can drastically increase closing rates by rapidly establishing trust with prospective buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Initially, this approach allowed for a 100% close rate for the discoverer and enabled new salespeople to close 80-90% of clients in a retail environment selling physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The "Ghost Product" Tactic: Building Trust Through Concession

The core of this strategy, originally called "sacrificial lambs" and now "ghost products," involves making concessions that demonstrate you are acting in the customer's self-interest, rather than your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This builds [[building_trust_in_sales_through_integrity | trust]] by giving the client a reason to believe you are not trying to take advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

The tactic was discovered while selling supplements in a gym. During nutrition orientations, product recommendations were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. When a key product ran out, instead of trying to "skirt around" the missing item, the salesperson advised the customer that a similar, cheaper alternative could be found at Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Immediately after this concession, customers purchased all other recommended products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

This led to intentionally identifying products that could be recommended for purchase elsewhere, even those that were lower margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Over time, the products used for these recommendations were not even carried in stock, as their primary value was in their role as a sales tool to gain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The recommendation is to make the products sent "across the street" the lowest margin items, gaining trust for the sale of higher-margin products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Practical Application

*   **Retail/Product Sales:** If selling multiple products, identify low-margin items that can be transparently suggested for purchase elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Service Sales (e.g., Web Design):** Inform clients that a service is not your core capability and suggest they can find it cheaper elsewhere, even providing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. This positions the salesperson as an ally.

## Intent as the Arbiter: Help vs. Manipulation

The distinction between manipulation and help hinges entirely on **intention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

> "If you want to help someone you are manipulating them but you're just doing it in a positive intent now and if you change someone's behavior and you have negative intent you are manipulating them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>

If you [[the_importance_of_belief_and_trust_in_sales | believe in the stuff that you sell]], you can create an environment where someone will [[building_trust_in_sales_through_integrity | trust]] you faster by giving them a reason to trust you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This means acting in their self-interest rather than solely your own, so they do not feel taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## The "Side of the Table" Principle

The ultimate goal in sales is to move psychologically from being "across the table" from the customer to being "shoulder to shoulder" with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This means both parties are looking at the decision together, with the same information, to make the best decision for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. The "ghost product" tactic is one of the fastest ways to achieve this psychological shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. By demonstrating that you prioritize their needs, you become an ally rather than just a salesperson.

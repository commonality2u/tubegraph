This article provides advice for individuals, like Avante, who are working multiple jobs, supporting a family, and seeking to improve their financial situation and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The core message emphasizes extreme dedication and sacrifice to achieve long-term success and financial stability.

## The Objective: Acquire Valuable Skills While Providing for Family

The primary goal is to carve out time to learn valuable skills while simultaneously fulfilling family responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This period of intense effort is described as a necessary "season" of imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Temporary Family Sacrifice

During this critical period, the family may experience short-term hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is argued that these sacrifices are better made when children are young and less likely to remember them, rather than later when they might be old enough to understand and be impacted more significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Financial Strategies for Self-Improvement

To free up resources for skill acquisition and advancement, several extreme financial measures are recommended:

*   **Cut All Costs:** Eliminate non-essential spending. This includes avoiding eating out, buying clothes, or any items not from discount stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Minimize Living Expenses:** Ideally, live with family or in a shared housing arrangement to reduce rent and utility costs as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The focus should be solely on food and shelter, dropping all other expenses to the greatest degree possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Increase Income Strategically:** While working current jobs, spend free time applying for better-paying positions, especially those like at-home phone sales which may offer starter roles with zero experience at $40,000 a year or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Consider driving for ride-sharing services like Uber for flexible hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Learn to Sell:** Start by selling others' items, then learn to buy and flip goods for profit, scaling up from small items to larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Realigning Relationships and Time

To achieve the necessary focus, it's crucial to evaluate and adjust relationships and time allocation:

*   **Information Diet:** Actively ignore advice from those who are poor or who discourage your ambition, as listening to them can keep you from progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Seek out content that supports your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This aligns with [[eliminating_distractions_for_selfimprovement]].
*   **Evaluate Relationships:** Anyone not actively supporting you in building a better future does not deserve your time. Every person you spend time or money on must earn their keep by helping you achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This is connected to [[aligning_relationships_with_personal_goals_and_values]].
*   **Family Unit Balance:** Acknowledge that individual [[worklife_balance_and_personal_fulfillment | balance]] may be impossible during this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Instead, aim for balance within the family unit: if one partner focuses on childcare, the other can intensely focus on career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The overall balance can also be viewed across your lifespan, with more leisure time in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This principle directly relates to [[balancing_marriage_and_career_goals]] and [[balancing_life_priorities_and_financial_goals]].

## The Mindset of Extreme Effort and Resilience

Success in this demanding period requires a specific mindset:

*   **Rejecting Luck:** Assume that luck is not a factor for you; success must be made to happen through sheer effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This is related to [[value_of_humility_and_selfimprovement]].
*   **"Ignorance, Not Sadness":** When feeling hopeless, reframe it as a lack of knowledge, which is controllable. This shifts power back to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Becoming Undeniable:** Cultivate high-skilled abilities and demonstrate extreme hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Work until your "fingers bleed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Volume Negates Luck:** Success comes from consistent, high-volume effort, whether it's learning new skills or applying for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Skill Acquisition:** Dedicate specific hours (e.g., 4 hours daily) to deep, focused study of one skill, stopping a timer if distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Just 20 hours can be enough to grasp basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This is part of an [[approach_to_learning_selfimprovement_and_mastering_skills]].
    *   **Job Applications:** Apply for jobs by personalizing every message, cover letter, and direct outreach to multiple people at each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Even if the first attempts fail, consistent high volume will eventually lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   **Post-Hire Effort:** Once hired, work significantly harder than the top performer to accelerate progress and become indispensable, like [[kobe_bryant | Kobe Bryant]] practicing three times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Maintain this intensity for a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This demonstrates [[the_importance_of_commitment_and_setting_priorities]].
*   **Embrace Rejection:** Rejection means you learn or win. Getting rejected a thousand times leaves you no worse off, but with a thousand experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. One "yes" can change everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This is linked to [[Self Respect and Personal Development]].
*   **Motivation Beyond Self:** If self-motivation falters, be willing to fail for your child and for the future "Avantes" you will inspire with your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The bigger the "monster" (challenge), the more epic the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

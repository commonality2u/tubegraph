[[conviction_and_tone_in_sales | Conviction]] is paramount in sales, acting as a corrective force for a salesperson's tone and overall effectiveness. Alex Hormozi emphasizes that deep belief in the product can allow a salesperson to outperform even seasoned veterans, as it naturally leads to the right approach because the salesperson genuinely wants to help the prospect [00:29:58].

## The Importance of Product Belief
The most crucial aspect of sales is the product itself [00:31:05]. If a salesperson genuinely [[the_importance_of_belief_and_trust_in_sales | believes in the product]], they don't need extensive sales skills because their [[importance_of_intention_in_sales | intention to help]] the person will guide them [00:31:00]. This belief must be unwavering and ethical [00:31:10]. Without a solid belief in the product, closing deals becomes nearly impossible unless one operates unethically [00:31:17].

## Building Conviction
To cultivate strong [[conviction_and_tone_in_sales | conviction]], salespeople should:
*   **Regularly Review Testimonials** Re-reading [[importance_of_proof_and_testimonials | testimonials]] out loud daily, especially in front of a sales team, reinforces belief in the product's effectiveness [00:32:05]. If the business lacks testimonials, it is advisable to find a different product or business that one can genuinely believe in [00:32:10].
*   **Commit to Product Improvement** Business owners must continuously strive to improve their product and take responsibility for any lack of customer success [00:32:31]. The focus should always be on what could have been done differently to help the next customer succeed, plugging any holes in the offering [00:32:44]. This commitment ensures that the effort put into the product genuinely merits the price charged [00:32:58].

## The Impact of Conviction
Salespeople who lack [[conviction_and_tone_in_sales | conviction]] often burn out, not because they cannot handle rejection, but because they cannot reconcile their actions with their own self-perception [00:33:12]. Putting in the necessary work and cultivating belief is essential for long-term success and resilience in sales [00:33:17].

A salesperson with strong [[conviction_and_tone_in_sales | conviction]] acts like a "disciple" or "evangelist" for their product [00:33:40]. Their deep [[the_importance_of_belief_and_trust_in_sales | belief]] makes scripting less relevant because their sincerity shines through [00:33:47]. The most convicted person will always lead the sales conversation, as the strength of their belief will overcome any skepticism from the prospect [00:33:56]. The question is not whether one believes, but to what extent [00:34:10].

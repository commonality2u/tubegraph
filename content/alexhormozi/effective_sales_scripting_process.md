This article outlines a sales presentation given at the War Room Mastermind, a $30,000-a-year program for 200-300 people run by Ryan Dice, Perry Belcher, and Roland Fraser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The presentation, condensed into a 30-minute video, is designed to help build a first [[effective_use_of_scripts_in_sales | sales script]] or scale a [[sales_team_scaling_strategies | sales team]] to onboard new people and achieve high sales percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The speaker, from acquisition.com, manages a portfolio of six companies doing $85 million a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The methods discussed have been successfully used to scale numerous [[sales_team_scaling_strategies | sales teams]], with one referenced company growing from 14 to almost 30 sales representatives using this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The approach focuses on improving [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals | closing percentages]] and enabling more team members to close at or above the lead salesperson's rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The content of this article is broken down into three key frameworks:
1.  **Closer Framework:** How to ask questions that lead prospects to say yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  **Conviction Framework:** How belief can outperform seasoned sales reps by controlling tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
3.  **Scaling Framework:** How to duplicate the sales process across teams in any niche within seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The speaker notes that his personal journey into phone sales started because other marketing methods like webinars and VSLs (Video Sales Letters) weren't working for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. By simply getting people's phone numbers and calling old webinar leads, he managed to do $100,000 in sales in a single day, finding it "so much easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This experience led to consulting with [[sales_team_scaling_strategies | sales teams]], and owning and training four [[high_ticket_sales_strategies | high ticket sales]] performance teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Closer Framework

The Closer Framework is a question-based [[effective_use_of_scripts_in_sales | sales script]] that is simpler than often portrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It works for B2C, B2B, low-ticket ($500), and [[high_ticket_sales_strategies | high-ticket]] ($100,000) sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The acronym CLOSER stands for:

*   **C - Clarify why they are there** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
    *   Ask questions like: "What made you come in today?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, "What made you reach out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, "What's your goal right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, "Why is that important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, "Why that number specifically?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, "What does it resonate for you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **L - Label them with a problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   This is crucial because you can't offer a solution if they don't admit a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Example: If they say, "I just wanted to find out more information," respond with, "I'm assuming you're not hopping on sales calls all day just running for information, is there a problem you're trying to solve?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   Confirm the problem: "So what I'm hearing is XYZ. Does that sound about right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This is a vital milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **O - Overview what they've tried so far** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    *   Gather intel by asking: "What have you tried so far to accomplish that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   This is the "pain cycle": "How long did you do that for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, "How long ago had that worked for you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, "What else have you tried?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Continue until they feel they've tried everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **S - Sell the vacation (solution)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
    *   The sales pitch should be under three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Focus on what they will *experience*, not *how* they will experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Typically sell three core benefits/things, regardless of industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> (e.g., for mortgage leads: exclusive, timely, qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>; for fitness: fitness, nutrition, accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>).
    *   Have 30-second memorized anecdotal stories for each commitment point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Example: For fitness, instead of talking about workouts, connect it to something they look forward to like a favorite TV show, implying they won't need motivation if they look forward to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   This framework emphasizes selling the "Maui" (the final destination/desired outcome), not the "plane flight" (the process, modules, details) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Everyone gets to Maui, but the variables are the speed and quality of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **E - Explain away concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
    *   **Price:** If a client says "I can't afford it," it means they don't understand the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. If Ferraris were $5,000, people would find the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Salespeople should believe that if someone can't afford the program, it's their fault for not conveying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Decision Maker:**
        1.  **Circumvent:** Ask, "What if they say no?" If they respond, "I'll probably do it anyway," then proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
        2.  **Divert:** If they say they wouldn't do it, ask, "What do you think their biggest objection would be?" This allows you to address the underlying obstacle even if the decision-maker isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
        3.  **Past Agreements:** Use previous agreements to project into the present. Example: "Does your business partner know you're struggling on sales? Does he approve of that? Then why would he be against something that solves a problem he already doesn't approve of?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
        4.  **Forgiveness over Permission:** Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
    *   **Stalls:** Teach prospects how to make decisions on the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Consider variables: "Can the product meet your needs?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, "Do you want to work with us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, "Do you have access to funds or know someone who does?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **R - Reinforce the decision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   This transitions into onboarding, leading to higher customer lifetime value (LTV), lower churn, and fewer refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
    *   Send personalized videos from the CEO or other leadership to welcome them and thank them for trusting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This matters as customers often decide if they like the business in the first 48 hours after the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Conviction Framework

The Conviction Framework explains how anyone who believes in the product can outperform a seasoned sales representative by simply controlling their tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

This framework is based on the concept of a "hidden dialogue," where two dialogues are always occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Words** convey logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Tone** speaks to the emotional brain, which makes decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
Therefore, "how you say what you say is what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

While seasoned sales reps can consciously control their tone (e.g., raising voice for a question, lowering for importance), there's a "trick" for others: **conviction will correct your tone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. If a salesperson truly believes in what they sell, they will say it the right way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

*   **Impact of Lost Conviction:** A salesperson might start strong, crushing it, but then tank if they lose belief due to negative customer feedback or reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Their tone will be off because they feel ethically compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

*   **Practical Actions to Hack Conviction:**
    1.  **Read testimonials aloud daily:** Reading fresh testimonials in front of the [[sales_team_scaling_strategies | sales team]] helps them feel they're making an impact, especially when they face daily rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
    2.  **Fix product issues:** Continuously improve the product and take ownership of any lack of success instead of blaming the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This aligns with [[sales_and_product_development | Sales and Product Development]].
    3.  **Involve customer support:** If sales dip, bring the head of customer support to a sales meeting to describe how they amaze customers. This reminds the sales team of the excellent post-sale experience, boosting their conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Scaling Framework: The 6 Cs

To easily duplicate the sales process across salespeople in any niche, implement these six "Cs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This framework has helped scale teams to multi-figure revenue and even build a 3,000-person affiliate base that added $35 million in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

1.  **Closer Sequence:** Ensure your [[effective_use_of_scripts_in_sales | sales script]] is a question-based framework that follows the CLOSER steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. This structure helps sales reps navigate calls easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
2.  **Consistent Daily Training:** This is the most important element after conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
    *   Teams should train 60 minutes a day, five days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
    *   **Talking (25 mins):** Have them read the script aloud, focusing on questions and correct tonality. If they make a mistake, they start over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
    *   **Overcoming Obstacles (5 mins):** Drill common objections (e.g., "I need to think about it," "I don't have the money," "I need to talk to my partner") so they can respond without thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The only things sales people should memorize are 30-second anecdotal stories and obstacle overcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
    *   **Listening (30 mins):** Listen to a 30-minute call recording daily. Analyze: "What went right in this call?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, "What went wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, "What do you do next time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. This is like game tape review for sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. This is part of [[sales_training_and_frameworks | sales training and frameworks]].
3.  **Call Recordings:** Crucial for studying "game film" and providing training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Gong.io is highly recommended for its AI capabilities that track metrics like talk time, questions asked, and who is speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
4.  **Communication Cycles:** Feedback should be focused on one thing at a time to be effective, similar to improving a golf swing by focusing on one small adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
    *   **Weekly Team Meetings:** For collective feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
    *   **Daily Wrap-up:** A short, uplifting session to pump up the team and acknowledge their hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
    *   **One-on-ones:** Weekly for new team members, bi-weekly for more experienced ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. This improves [[improving_sales_techniques_for_closing_deals | sales techniques]].
5.  **Cuts:** Underperforming salespeople who cannot close deals within the first 1-2 weeks (unless it's a very complex product) should be cut quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. It's more effective to take a good performer (a "six") to a high performer (a "nine") than to try and bring a struggling person (a "two") to average (a "five") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
6.  **Competition and Career Path:**
    *   **Competition:** Salespeople are competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Six-week cycles for competitions work best, as they are long enough for accomplishment but short enough to maintain urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Group goals around 10-15% conversion rates are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Mini-teams (e.g., 4-person teams) foster camaraderie while maintaining competitiveness, allowing for adjusted drafts where strong performers can help weaker ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
    *   **Career Path:** Create minor milestones (e.g., 50, 100, 150 deals closed) with small increases in commission (e.g., $500 to $525 per deal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. A clear roadmap of progress helps relieve anxiety and keeps salespeople focused in a repetitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Include management roles for further advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

As an additional point on [[efficiency_in_the_sales_process | efficiency]], separate outbound and inbound sales teams, and also separate setters and [[sales_closing_frameworks | closers]] within those teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Different lead types (outbound vs. inbound) require different approaches, and separating them leads to higher conversion rates if there's enough lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

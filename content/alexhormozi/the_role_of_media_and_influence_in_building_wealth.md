The economic landscape has fundamentally shifted, moving from a focus on energy resources to the increasingly valuable commodity of human attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This shift signifies a new era where influence and media mastery are paramount for [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Attention: The New Oil

In the last century, the wealthiest individuals and largest companies were built on oil and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Today, four out of the top five biggest companies are built not on the old oil, but on the "new oil" â€” attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The constant pumping and drilling in the modern economy is for the attention of the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This involves capturing as many hours of people's open eyes and ears as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Just as oil was once a scarce resource, attention is now the most valuable scarce resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Those who create platforms enabling others to "drill" for attention are effectively buying up the digital real estate of collective attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Unlike oil tycoons who had to haggle for land, today's attention magnates simply "take" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Notable examples of individuals who have leveraged attention into immense wealth include:
*   Conor McGregor, whose Proper No. Twelve whiskey became a $600 million deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, whose Teremana Tequila is now valued at approximately $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Kylie Jenner, who became a billionaire at 20, making the front of Forbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Mr. Beast, predicted to become a centibillionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Huda Beauty, who sold a percentage of her company for $600 million, now valued at over a billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Leverage Through Media

The concept of [[leverage_and_its_role_in_wealth_creation | leverage]] is key to understanding how these individuals achieved such financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Leverage is defined as the difference between effort put in and output received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The individuals who earn the most money are those with the greatest leverage, maximizing returns on their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Naval Ravikant's "Almanac" outlines four types of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:
1.  **Labor**: Having other people do work for you, freeing up your time and increasing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  **Capital**: Investing money provided by others to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
3.  **Code**: Creating software that millions can use, requiring a one-time investment for potentially infinite returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
4.  **Media**: Producing content (like a video) that can be seen by millions or hundreds of millions of people with a single effort, providing immense leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Media is a powerful compounding vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Unlike traditional businesses where output is often linear, media allows for a single investment of time to multiply itself repeatedly, reaching a vast audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The Shift in Personal Beliefs

Initially, the speaker preferred to build businesses like Gym Launcher and Prestige Labs, focusing on running ads and remaining "rich and unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This belief was challenged by the success of individuals like Kylie Jenner, who at 20, had a net worth far exceeding the speaker's income despite being seven years younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This sparked a "huge belief shift" and a realization that his existing business models lacked the compounding leverage seen in media-driven ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The speaker's ego initially led to protective excuses, attributing Kylie's success to her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, witnessing similar successes from Huda Beauty, Conor McGregor, and The Rock repeatedly, forced a re-evaluation of his core beliefs about [[wealth creation strategies | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Overcoming the fear of exposure and "weirdos" that come with fame was another hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. A conversation with Dean Graziosi provided a pivotal moment: "If a couple weird letters every day or every week is the price I have to pay for the impact I want to have, I pay that price any day of the week and twice on Sunday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This helped the speaker realize that the desire to make business education available to everyone required matching actions to that goal, embracing the necessary exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the key realization was that content is not the output; it is the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The output is the audience, and the audience is what compounds and sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The audience is the scarce resource that continuously pumps attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Translating Attention into Money

Successfully translating attention into money involves several key factors:

1.  **Long-Term Audience Building**: Influencers spend significant time building and amassing attention before attempting to monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The Rock, for example, built his brand for 20 years before signing deals or launching products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The longer one waits and gives value to their audience, the bigger the potential monetization can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
2.  **On-Brand Monetization**: The products or services chosen for monetization must align with the influencer's brand and resonate with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The Rock's deal with Under Armour makes sense because fitness is central to his brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Status Association**: Celebrities are iconic figures that brands seek to associate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Consumers then buy the brand to associate themselves with the status embodied by the celebrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Examples include Kim Kardashian with Dolce & Gabbana and LeBron James with Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
4.  **Multi-Dimensional Engagement (Cross-Pollination)**: Mega-stars like Joe Rogan engage deeply across multiple interests (UFC, comedy, fitness, biohacking, UFOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This allows them to attract diverse audiences and cross-pollinate them, leading to even faster audience compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## The Future of Wealth Creation

The game of [[building_and_maintaining_wealth | wealth creation]] has fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. If past generations were built on oil, the new generation of billionaires will be built on attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Media will only become more expensive and fragmented over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, making the cost of acquiring and holding an audience more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

The individuals who will become the new "centibillionaires" will be those who can perform three critical actions:
1.  **Capture** attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
2.  **Hold** attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
3.  **Multiply** attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

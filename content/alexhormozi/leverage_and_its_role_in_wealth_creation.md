The economic landscape has shifted dramatically, moving from a focus on energy and power to attention as the new "oil" for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. In the last century, the wealthiest individuals and largest companies were built on oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:24]</a>. Today, four out of the top five biggest companies in the world are built on "attention," which is the "new oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:33]</a>. The collective eyes and ears of humanity, 24 hours a day, represent this new "pie" that companies are fighting to capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:03]</a>. Just as oil was once a scarce resource, attention has become the scarce resource of the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Power of Attention

High-profile individuals and celebrities have demonstrated the immense wealth-generating potential of captured attention:
*   Conor McGregor's Proper Twelve whiskey deal was valued at $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   The Rock's Teremana Tequila is now valued at approximately $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   Kylie Jenner became a Forbes-listed billionaire at age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Mr. Beast is projected to become a centibillionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

These examples highlight how individuals can leverage their audience to create significant wealth, often with smaller teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The value lies in the compounding effect of an audience, which acts as a consistent source of "pumped attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. For instance, Mr. Beast attracted 10,000 people to a local restaurant opening, showcasing the direct impact of his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Understanding Leverage

Leverage is defined as the difference between what you put in and what you get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Those who earn the most money possess the most [[leverage_as_a_key_to_making_money | leverage]], as everyone has the same amount of time, but not the same return on that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Types of Leverage

Inspired by Naval Ravikant's Almanac, the speaker identifies four primary types of [[leverage_and_its_types_for_maximizing_business_success | leverage]]:
1.  **Labor**: Getting other people to do tasks for you, freeing up your time and increasing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  **Capital**: Investing money provided by others to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Code**: Creating software that, once built, can be used by millions, offering infinite returns on a one-time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:04:01]</a>.
4.  **Media**: Producing content (like a video) that, once created, can be consumed by millions or even hundreds of millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:09]</a>.

Media and code are particularly powerful because they allow for compounding, meaning a single investment of effort can multiply returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:37]</a>.

### The Power of Compounding

Compounding is a crucial form of [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:41]</a>. It's about an investment that multiplies itself over and over again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:43]</a>. For example, Warren Buffett's success with Berkshire Hathaway is attributed to the compounding of money itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:54]</a>.

The speaker initially disregarded content creation, preferring to be "rich and unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:56]</a>. However, seeing the success of figures like Kylie Jenner, Huda Beauty, Conor McGregor, and The Rock, who all leveraged their media presence for massive deals, caused a significant belief shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:55]</a>. He realized that his business lacked a compounding vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:33]</a>.

> "I thought if I got one more person who's gonna see this short or see this long or see this post or see this tweet or see this whatever that was the point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:25]</a>

A pivotal moment occurred during a conversation with Dean Graziosi, who challenged the speaker's reluctance to engage with public exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:40]</a>. Graziosi stated that dealing with "weirdos" or "a couple weird letters" was a small price to pay for the impact he wanted to have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:52]</a>. This shifted the speaker's perspective, making him realize that if he truly wanted to make business education available to everyone, his actions needed to align with that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:05]</a>. He concluded that content is the *input*, and the *output* is the audience, which compounds and sticks, gathering the scarce resource of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Monetizing Attention Effectively

Successful figures convert attention into money by:
1.  **Long-Term Brand Building**: They spend significant time building and amassing attention without immediately monetizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:41]</a>. The Rock, for example, built his brand for 20 years before signing major deals with Under Armour, Teremana, and ZOA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:50]</a>. The longer one can wait, the bigger the eventual monetization can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:06]</a>.
2.  **On-Brand Monetization**: The products or services chosen for monetization are "on brand" and resonate with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:13]</a>. The Rock's partnership with Under Armour aligns perfectly with his fitness-focused brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:27]</a>.
3.  **Endorsement and Association**: Celebrities lend their status to brands, allowing consumers to associate the brand with the celebrity's desired qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:50]</a>. For instance, Nike signed LeBron James to associate their brand with victory and iconic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:09:08]</a>. Consumers then buy the brand to gain a perceived association with that status or aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:14]</a>.
4.  **Multi-Dimensional Engagement**: Mega-stars like Joe Rogan go deep on multiple, seemingly different, interests (UFC, comedy, fitness, biohacking, UFOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:31]</a>. This "cross-pollination" captures broader audiences and compounds their reach even faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:42]</a>.

## The Future of Wealth Creation

The fundamental game of wealth creation has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:00]</a>. While past generations built wealth on resources like oil, the new generation will build on attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:05]</a>. Media will continue to become more expensive and fragmented, making the audience increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:17]</a>.

The future "centibillionaires" will be those who can perform three key actions with attention:
1.  **Capture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
2.  **Hold** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
3.  **Multiply** attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:27]</a>.

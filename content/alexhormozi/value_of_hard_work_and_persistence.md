Winning in your 20s and beyond, as someone who made their first million at 26 and crossed a $100 million net worth at 31, involves a roadmap centered on [[the_concept_of_working_hard_and_pushing_through_pain | brutal honesty and consistent effort]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Foundation of Hard Work

A normalized 6-day, 12-hour work week is recommended for men between 16 and 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Your value is based on your utility, and when young, you have abundant energy to trade for experience points, thus becoming useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Resourcefulness Over Resources

The first rule of [[work_ethic_and_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]] is to use what you've got <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Many people delay starting due to perceived lack of capital, connections, or other resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it's about resourcefulness, not just having resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Use your energy, the resource you possess, to gain experience and prove your capability in a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Skill Development Through Repetition

You only get good at a skill by starting not good at it, repeating it, failing, and making [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | incremental improvements]] through many repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means checking your ego at the door and not caring what others think, as they won't be around in ten years when you've formed a new, better peer group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Practical Steps for Financial Growth
For those with less than $100,000 in savings, practical steps include:
*   Stop eating out; use discount groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Stop buying new clothes; shop at Goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Only attend free friend events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Friends who don't support your goals may be enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Dedicate time to:
    *   Apply for higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Pick up side hustle work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   Learn skills for a higher hourly rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   Find the hardest worker and double their input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This leads to faster improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Financial Discipline for Future Bets
Building a significant financial stockpile allows for [[patience_in_achieving_success | patience]] and long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If you're in survival mode, focusing on daily needs, long-term strategy is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The goal is to minimize survival costs to enter "thrive mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Personal Growth Through Action

### Provide Value and Gain Skills
To make money, you must provide value to an employer or customers, exchanging utility for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Increasing your usefulness leads to developing ancillary skills that generalize across life domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Sales skills, for instance, are applicable in conversations, negotiations, and various aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Volume and Feedback Loop
Skill development occurs through volume and a feedback loop: the number of repetitions multiplied by the amount of improvement between repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. It's not enough to simply produce; you must analyze what worked and what didn't, then refine your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This iterative process of doing, analyzing, and adjusting leads to significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### [[role_of_patience_and_action_in_success | Patience with Outputs, Impatience with Inputs]]
This principle means being patient for results but relentless with your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. You control the "doing something" part (inputs), not the "money happening" part (outputs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Action alleviates anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. When impatience arises, use action as a coping mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Work with the intention to improve, not just for work's sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Learning from Others
Humble yourself and learn from those ahead of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. This willingness to learn and ask questions can provide thousands of dollars worth of advice and years of saved time for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Investing in your own learning and skills is the ultimate asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Skills compound; knowing two critical skills (e.g., sales and finance, or coding and marketing) can disproportionately increase your potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Physical Discipline and Avoiding Stupidity
Many problems can be avoided by maintaining physical discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Going to bed on time, for example, eliminates many issues that derail young men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Avoiding stupidity is easier than trying to be intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Being in shape provides more energy, focus, and improves outcomes in various aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Getting in shape costs time, not money, and time is cheaper when you're young and have fewer responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## The Power of Compounding
Your actions now amplify throughout your career and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Stacking advantages like sleeping on time, not drinking, getting in shape, doing many repetitions, and humbling yourself to experienced individuals, compounds success over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. While your brain's processing power peaks in your 20s, experience and learning make older individuals "smarter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## The Battle Against Distraction
Your reference group significantly influences your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Sometimes, you must value your goals more than your friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The journey to exceptional achievement is often lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Your goals will serve you longer than many current relationships, which are often based on convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. To be exceptional means being the exception, stepping out of the "in-group" comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

Entertainment, including social media and "motivation porn," distracts you from what truly matters in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. Every minute spent on distraction is a minute not spent advancing your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

## Delaying Gratification
The overarching "meta skill" is your ability to delay gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. Pushing through the initial period without immediate reward until you get that first, outsized reinforcement is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

## Consistency and Self-Improvement
Great salespeople never get cold; they maintain discipline and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This involves understanding how to consistently treat every interaction with the same intensity as when you're "on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. These behaviors are skills that can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

## Reframing Challenges: "Demons" as Skill Deficiencies
When facing perceived "demons," "self-sabotage," or "mom/dad issues," it often translates to a lack of skills in how to behave under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.
*   **Logic**: Define the "demon" in terms of observable behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
*   **Evidence**: Provide data or instances that prove this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Utility**: Ask "who cares?" or "why does this matter?" in relation to your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
This framework removes mysticism and focuses on actionable behavioral changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

## The "Last Man Standing" Game
[[critique_of_hard_work_as_a_path_to_wealth | Entrepreneurship]] is not a game of "best man wins," but "last man standing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. This "infinite game" perspective emphasizes endurance and persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

### The Only Wrong Answer: Doing Nothing
It's never been easier to start a business, but also never been easier to do nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Most people already know what they need to do to get in shape or achieve goals but delay action under the guise of finding a "better plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Reality often has many right answers, with the only wrong one being inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Fear of failure or disapproval are the primary obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

You need three things to win:
1.  The balls to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
2.  The brains to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
3.  The heart to never quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Choice to Be Exceptional
Balance in life is often a myth for those who achieve great things; they focus intensely on one area to gain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. Hardship is not a tragedy but an opportunity to prove your resilience and become the "savage hero" of your own story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. [[Value of executing the basics well | Most things can be learned in 20 hours]] of focused effort, but most people delay those initial hours for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. Your actions are the only thing that matters, not desire, deservingness, or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. [[Work ethic and entrepreneurship | Work ethic]] is the currency of respect, and a man is judged by what he can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

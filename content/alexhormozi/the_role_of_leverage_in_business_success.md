The belief that hard work alone leads to wealth is a misconception; [[leverage_as_a_key_to_making_money | hard work]] will not make you rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Influencers who claim "no one can outwork me" are often objectively false and their statements are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While putting in volume and doing the work is crucial for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, bragging about the amount of work is misguided because work has very little to do with success at the highest levels of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Consider Warren Buffett, who deems a year successful if he makes two good decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He reads five to six hours a day and makes few but impactful choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with those who emphasize working long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Everyone has the same number of hours in a day, so simply working more hours does not differentiate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Output Formula: Volume Ã— Leverage

Total output is determined by the volume of activity multiplied by the [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] of that activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While some initial energy input is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, measuring success by the number of activities is a "newbie measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Successful individuals like Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos don't focus on activity metrics like sending a thousand emails or waking up early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Waking up early, going to bed late, or not sleeping much are superstitious beliefs and don't inherently matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. What truly matters are the inputs that generate the most [[leverage_and_its_types_for_maximizing_business_success | leverage]] for the greatest output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> "The few things that matter are the inputs that go into the system that have the most leverage to create the most output." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

For a novice, getting started and doing *something* is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. However, there's a limit to how much physical work one can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Once maximum work capacity is reached, the next step is to maximize the [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] of those activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Even a low-leverage activity done many times can yield more than a single high-leverage one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, but the goal is to shift towards higher-leverage tasks.

## Shifting to High-Leverage Activities

When a CEO joins a company like acquisition.com, they often work nearly every hour of every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The focus isn't on working *more*, but on changing *what* they work on, as that is the only remaining lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This involves analyzing calendars and organizational charts to identify and delegate low-leverage activities to other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If no one in the existing structure can take on these tasks, it signals a need to hire for that specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This strategic shift is how you [[role_of_leverage_and_efficiency_in_scaling_a_business | grow a business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## The Entrepreneur as a Coach

The "no one can outwork me" mentality is problematic because there are multiple ways to win in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Like a video game war party, a business team needs diverse skills, not just one type of player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. You wouldn't field a football team with only running backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The entrepreneur's true role should be that of a [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | coach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Success depends on organizing the team and how well its pieces play together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A team with an All-Star but a poor supporting cast often loses to a better overall team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Many entrepreneurs try to be the star player, scoring all the points, but ultimately lose to well-organized teams like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Bragging about work is akin to celebrating just one type of player; it's not the sole requirement for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Specialized Roles in Business

To win, it's more valuable to understand:
1.  The distinct roles within a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
2.  Which role best suits your characteristics and skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  Your eventual evolution through entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Businesses have various functions, each requiring specialized skills:
*   **Marketing/Promotion:** Making things known, storytelling, branding, providing audience value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Sales:** Converting attention into direct sales, whether through ads, sales pages, or person-to-person interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This includes direct selling, training others to sell, and leading sales trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Marketers can be poor at sales, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Product:** Creating something beautiful and functional. The founder of Shopify, for example, excelled as a product visionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience/Success:** Managing customer engagement, providing value, ensuring amazing experiences, and helping customers hit milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This is distinct from product design and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

As an enterprise grows, skills become more specialized and require deeper experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Instead of claiming "I can't be outworked," leaders should boast: "I can't be out-recruited," "I can't be out-managed," or "No one can build a culture like me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These are high-[[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] activities across an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While working hard is good, claiming to be the hardest worker is an irrelevant activity metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The entrepreneur's journey involves progressing from being a specialized expert (e.g., CMO, Chief Sales Officer, Chief Product Officer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> to, ultimately, becoming the [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | coach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## The CEO's Ultimate Leverage

The best [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | coaches]] actively headhunt and recruit top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, similar to how Google recruits the best and brightest from universities, business schools, and at the executive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The parallels between sports and business are striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The final level of entrepreneurship involves being the [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | coach]]:
*   Recruiting top-level executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Creating a farm system to feed into the company, ensuring sustained competitive advantage and a dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Developing soft skills to foster a high-performance culture, maximizing each player's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The value of a [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | coach]] or CEO is the difference between what players would achieve without [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | leadership]] and what they achieve with the best [[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The CEO must have the highest return on time in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, constantly solving the next problem and replacing their own direct activities with new ones that further build the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] can transform large businesses within a few years through setting standards and embodying values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

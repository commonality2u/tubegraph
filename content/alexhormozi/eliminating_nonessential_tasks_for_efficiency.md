For business owners and high-level employees, a key to financial success is to understand what "work" truly is and to eliminate activities that do not directly contribute to business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Most people claim to work daily but cannot even define the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Instead of defining work by time spent or effort expended, a more useful definition for knowledge workers is that "work equals outputs," where outputs equal "volume times leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This means the number of times you do something multiplied by how much you get out of each instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. To do more work per unit of time, one must focus on "output per unit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Identifying High-Impact Activities

To [[defining_and_optimizing_work_output | define and optimize work output]], businesses fundamentally grow in two ways: getting more customers or making existing customers worth more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. These break down into four core actions:

*   **Getting more customers:**
    *   Increasing traffic (e.g., advertising more or better) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>
    *   Converting a higher percentage of traffic (e.g., practicing sales, improving offers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>
*   **Making customers worth more:**
    *   Raising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>
    *   Decreasing churn/getting people to buy more times (e.g., reach-outs, exit interviews, improved onboarding, faster results, client events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>

Many business owners spend their time on activities that have the same impact as doing nothing, leading to stalled growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. For most smaller businesses, effort should disproportionately focus on increasing traffic and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Volume

Excellence comes from repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. To become exceptionally good at a core activity like advertising, one must dedicate significant "volume" to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This could mean:

*   Spending four hours a day scripting, analyzing, writing, copying, or recording ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   Four hours a day reaching out to people across social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   Making content for four hours a day on every platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   Doing outreach or creating content to support affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

If you are thinking about how you will find the time to do this, remember that "doing everything else is doing nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Your time must look like a growing business, not a stalled one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

It's crucial to understand that if your business isn't growing, the tasks you are prioritizing are likely wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This involves learning to [[prioritizing_tasks_for_business_success | prioritize tasks for business success]] and "letting some fires burn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Some problems, while real, are not "the problem of the business today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. You can neglect them for a period until they become the true constraint, then focus intensely on solving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

## Finding Time: Maker vs. Manager Time

Every entrepreneur has two types of work:
*   **Maker Time:** Long, uninterrupted blocks of 4-6 hours, representing high-importance, low-urgency work that moves the business forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. A productive maker calendar is an empty calendar, as interruptions destroy entire blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.
*   **Manager Time:** Small blocks of 5-15 minutes, used for training teams, coordinating, communicating, and putting out fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. The goal is to fill the calendar with these slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

Disaster occurs when these two work styles mix; attempting to fit small management tasks into maker time kills half a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. It's essential to understand which type of work you are doing and communicate this to your team to protect crucial time periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. This directly impacts [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | time management and productivity for leaders]].

### Practical Habits for Maker Time

To facilitate maker time, consider these habits:
*   Decide on the one most important project to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.
*   Dedicate 4-5 hours daily, ideally early in the morning (e.g., 4 AM to 9 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   Turn off all notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
*   Create a distraction-free environment (dark room, no sound, earplugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. This is a core [[tactics_to_eliminate_distractions_and_focus | tactic to eliminate distractions and focus]] and also helps with [[eliminating_distractions_for_selfimprovement | eliminating distractions for self-improvement]] and [[avoiding_distractions_and_shiny_object_syndrome | avoiding distractions and shiny object syndrome]].
*   Realize there are no business "emergencies" (only 911 scenarios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, including weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
*   Consider working weekends, which offer 104 days of uninterrupted time annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

## Buying Time: Outsourcing Non-Essential Personal Tasks

As a business owner, you are the most valuable person in your business, producing the most value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Just as you would maximize a star employee's time, you must maximize your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

One battery powers all aspects of your life (work, family, chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. You become more productive by [[understanding_and_eliminating_business_inefficiencies | understanding and eliminating business inefficiencies]] that drain your energy, rather than by adding optimization hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

Consider the time spent on common personal tasks and their replacement cost:
*   **Food:** 50 hours/month (groceries, prepping, eating, cleaning) can be replaced for ~$800/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   **Cleaning:** 25 hours/month can be replaced for ~$500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.
*   **Laundry:** 16 hours/month (washing, drying, folding, organizing, dry cleaning, driving) can be replaced for ~$200/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

For approximately $1,500 a month, you can regain 96 hours per month, equivalent to two full work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. If you can make more than $15 per hour with your time, this trade is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. This is a form of reinvesting in yourself, but the purchased time *must* be used for high-impact work, not leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

This is a one-time investment in increased productivity, not a recurring benefit that can be repurchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs hesitate to spend money on services they perceive as "fancy" or "frilly," despite happily hiring employees for much higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. If you wouldn't hesitate to give a valuable employee 50% more productivity for $1,500/month, you should make the same investment in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

## The Power of Elimination over Optimization

True productivity gains come more from [[importance_of_saying_no_to_maximize_productivity | eliminating distractions for self-improvement]] and non-essential tasks than from optimizing existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Cutting things out creates permanent reductions in energy drainage, allowing you to reallocate that energy to activities that make more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.

Someone who dedicates 16 productive hours a day, six days a week, will move significantly faster than someone who only manages three productive hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. This stark difference in "real work time" can explain why some businesses grow 30 times faster than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

By working on the right things—getting more customers and making them worth more—your business will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. To maximize this growth, ensure your day is filled with high-impact "maker time" activities, not unproductive "manager time" gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.

Achieve this by:
*   Understanding the difference between maker and manager time and communicating it to your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>.
*   Implementing daily habits to protect your maker time (deciding on a core project, waking early, turning off notifications, creating a focused environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.
*   Investing in yourself by buying back time from less valuable personal tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.

This strategy allows you to be 30 times more effective than competitors who remain distracted and unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. The secret is simple: eliminate as many drains on your single battery as possible that aren't aligned with your goals, compressing multiple lifetimes of growth into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

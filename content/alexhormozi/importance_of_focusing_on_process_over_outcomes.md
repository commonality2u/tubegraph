Many people enter new ventures, such as starting a podcast, with the expectation of rapid success, often within 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">00:00:49</a>. This mindset can lead to discouragement, especially for those starting without an existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>. However, true and lasting success is typically the result of consistent, long-term effort and a [[understanding_the_impact_of_commitment_and_focus | commitment]] to the process, rather than an immediate focus on outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">00:01:39</a>.

## The Long Road to Success

The journey to significant achievement often takes years, not months. For instance, one podcast took five and a half to six years to break into the top 10 in its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>. During this six-year period, the creator consistently produced one to three podcasts every week without fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">00:00:41</a>.

The initial phase of any endeavor is crucial for development and learning:
*   **Finding Your Voice**: The first year is often spent discovering your unique style and approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">00:00:53</a>.
*   **Skill Development**: This period involves learning how to communicate effectively, teach, entertain, present, and speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">00:00:56</a>.
*   **Evolving Content**: Just as skills improve, the subject matter itself evolves. Early content might be highly specialized (e.g., how to run a gym better for the first 150 episodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">00:01:08</a>, eventually broadening to related topics like marketing, sales, and general business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">00:01:12</a>. Both the content and delivery skills improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">00:01:21</a>.

## Shifting Focus from Outcomes to Actions

A common pitfall is to focus on immediate results, such as sales or money earned. This can create a cycle where activity slows down once an income threshold is met, leading to "scarcity mode" when funds dry up, and then a frantic return to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">00:02:48</a>. This pattern, where activities stop after seeing an outcome, indicates a lack of the trait of [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">00:03:19</a>.

To break this cycle, the [[focus_on_improvement_over_profitability | focus]] must shift from the sales or money being made to the process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">00:03:07</a>.

> "You need to be able to do the doing without seeing the result of your doing and you have to keep doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">00:03:29</a>.

This means consistently performing the necessary actions, whether results are immediately positive or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">00:03:35</a>. If activities are maintained, even if outcomes are delayed, eventual success becomes more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">00:03:41</a>.

## The Power of Action-Oriented Goals

Based on concepts from "Atomic Habits," all winners and losers share the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>, making goals themselves not unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">00:04:19</a>. What truly differentiates individuals are the activities they perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">00:04:21</a>.

*   The goal of a winner is to [[understanding_the_impact_of_commitment_and_focus | commit]] to the activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">00:04:24</a>.
*   The goal of a loser is to [[understanding_the_impact_of_commitment_and_focus | commit]] to the outcome-based goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">00:04:26</a>.

If you aim to be a millionaire, the [[importance_of_focus_and_perseverance_in_entrepreneurship | focus]] should not be on "making a million dollars" but on the consistent actions that lead to that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">00:04:43</a>. By divorcing activities from outcomes, you can maintain [[the_importance_of_focus_and_avoiding_distractions | focus]] on what you can control: the doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">00:04:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">00:04:59</a>. This approach stabilizes self-esteem regardless of fluctuating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">00:04:54</a>.

## Thinking in Decades, Not Days

Adopting a long-term mindset, thinking in decades rather than days, is transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">00:05:15</a>. A commitment to a process for 5 to 10 years, or even a decade, is uncommon but essential for substantial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">00:05:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">00:05:21</a>. Most clients prioritize immediate leads within 90 days, missing the bigger picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">00:05:28</a>.

This long-term perspective has several benefits:
*   **Sustainable Growth**: It allows for consistent progress without the emotional rollercoaster of short-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">00:06:01</a>.
*   **Building Character**: By [[importance_of_focus_and_perseverance_in_entrepreneurship | committing]] to actions and behaviors, you grow into a person capable of sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">00:03:51</a>.
*   **Freedom from Financial Constraints**: The trait of consistency, developed through process [[importance_of_focus_in_business | focus]], can lead to a point where money is no longer a limiting factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">00:04:02</a>.

Ultimately, putting your "game playing life" into things you *can* control – the consistent actions – rather than the outcomes you cannot, is the path to enduring success and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">00:06:09</a>. If you consistently produce content, like 400 long-form episodes, your following will inevitably grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">00:06:34</a>. The question shouldn't be "how long will it take?" but rather embracing that it will take "as long as it takes," because the [[the_importance_of_focus_and_avoiding_distractions | goal]] is the *doing*, not just the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">00:06:40</a>.

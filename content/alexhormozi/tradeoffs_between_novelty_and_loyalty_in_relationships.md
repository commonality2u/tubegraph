The person one chooses to spend their life with significantly impacts who they become, what they achieve, and their overall happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Despite this, many people spend more time deciding on a car or neighborhood than on a spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Research suggests a 71% correlation between subjective well-being and the strength of one's relationship with their significant other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Over time, the amount of time spent with a spouse increases, while time with friends, family, and kids decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, making the spouse the person with whom one spends the most time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Choice: Novelty vs. Loyalty
When considering [[long_term_commitment_mindset | long-term commitment]], a significant [[the_significance_of_making_tradeoffs_to_achieve_success | tradeoff]] arises between novelty and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The speaker articulates this choice as trading:
*   **Novelty for Loyalty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>: Giving up the excitement of new experiences and partners for the security and predictability of a committed relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Loyalty, in this context, is defined as the ability to predict another person's future behavior based on their stated intentions and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Exploration for Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>: Ceasing to explore new romantic possibilities in favor of investing time into one relationship, which yields the dividend of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **The Chase for a Journey Together** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>: Moving from constantly seeking new partners to embarking on a shared journey with one person towards a common idea, goal, or purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

For the speaker, these were worthwhile [[the_significance_of_making_tradeoffs_to_achieve_success | tradeoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. He stopped seeing anyone he didn't believe he could marry, which saved time for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Honesty and Intentions
It is considered unethical to pretend a future commitment (like marriage or children) might happen when one knows it won't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Instead, it is crucial to state facts and tell the truth in hard conversations, clearly communicating intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. If someone truly prefers novelty, exploration, or the chase, then marriage may not be the right path for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

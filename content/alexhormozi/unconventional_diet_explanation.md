The speaker, coming from the [[Maintaining Fitness with Simple Nutrition | fitness world]], observed at a mastermind event that many entrepreneurs adopted "weird shticks" related to food, exercise, hydration, and biohacking, which he considers "complete make believe" and a "farce" used for selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While others at the event were following strict [[Dieting and nutrition strategies | diets]] like keto or intermittent fasting, he openly ate Twizzlers, cookies, and ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Despite this, he was in better physical shape than everyone present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Months later, several attendees adopted his approach to [[Maintaining Fitness with Simple Nutrition | eating]] and got in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The speaker has maintained a six-pack since he was 13 or 14, while eating ice cream daily, consuming alcohol, and eating cookies, for nearly 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This method, which he lives by, is explained as a sustainable way to stay in shape forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Critiquing Conventional Diets

The speaker argues that most popular [[Dieting and nutrition strategies | diets]] are fundamentally the same because they all lead to a reduction in calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>:
*   **Keto:** Eliminates carbohydrates, resulting in approximately one-third fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Low-Fat Diet:** Eliminates fat, also leading to about one-third fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Portion Control:** Involves eating less of all macronutrients, leading to fewer calories overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Reduces the number of meals per day, thereby reducing overall calorie intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The speaker dismisses arguments that specific diets work better for certain individuals (e.g., "I do really well with low carb") as "horseshit," asserting that only [[caloriefocused_dietary_strategies | calories]] truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He explains that diets fail when individuals compensate for removed calories by adding more calories from other sources, such as consuming excess fat and protein on a keto diet by drinking butter or eating rib-eyes for breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## The Speaker's "Unconventional" Approach

The speaker's strategy revolves around two primary numbers: daily calorie intake and daily [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He also mentions the importance of training "volume," but focuses on nutrition for this explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### 1. Understanding Your Body Type & Goals

The first step is to define your current [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | body type]] (e.g., high fat, low muscle; low muscle, low fat; high fat, high muscle; low fat, high muscle) and your desired [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | body type]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This helps determine whether you need to increase or decrease [[caloriefocused_dietary_strategies | calories]] and training volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### 2. Calculating Daily Calories

The simplest way to determine daily calorie needs is by multiplying your current body weight by a goal-specific multiplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>:
*   **Maintenance:** Body weight x 13-15 (e.g., 200 lbs x 15 = 3000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Fast Weight Loss:** Body weight x 10 (e.g., 200 lbs x 10 = 2000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The multiplier can range from 7 (extreme weight loss) to 21 (extreme weight gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   If you're not losing weight as fast as desired, simply decrease the calorie intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### 3. Calculating Daily Protein

Aim for your body weight in grams of [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Conversion:** 100 grams of [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] is roughly equivalent to one pound of lean meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Example:** A 200-pound person needs 200 grams of [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]], which is two pounds of lean meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   This lean meat can be any source like shrimp, tilapia, tenderloin, flank steak, top round, top sirloin, or chicken breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. All lean meats are roughly similar in [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] content per gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### 4. Allocating Remaining Calories

After determining total calories and [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]], calculate the calories derived from your [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] intake.
*   Each gram of [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] is roughly 4 calories, but to account for trace fats in lean protein sources, multiply your total [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] grams by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Example:** For a 200-pound person aiming for 2200 daily calories (moderate weight loss) and 200 grams of [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]]:
    *   Calories from protein: 200 grams x 5 = 1000 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   Remaining calories: 2200 (total) - 1000 (from protein) = 1200 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   These 1200 remaining calories can be filled with "whatever the hell you want," including ice cream, cookies, or any other foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

The "cornerstone" of this [[alex_hormozis_daily_diet_routine | diet]] is to consume enough [[Protein consumption in diet | protein]] first, protecting muscle mass, and then fill the remaining calorie allowance with desired foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Flexibility and Sustainability

This method offers significant flexibility:
*   **Meal Frequency:** Meals can be split up in any way desired—five meals, three meals, or even one meal a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Food Choices:** The 1200 discretionary calories can be changed daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Appetite vs. Volume:** People who prefer less food may choose more appetizing, calorie-dense options, while those who prefer large volumes of food might choose more whole foods like potatoes and rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

This [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | approach]] aims to solve [[common_misconceptions_about_diets | dieting]] for good, as there's no "falling off" a [[Dieting and nutrition strategies | diet]] because nothing is forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Regular consumption of treats like ice cream or cookies makes them less "special," reducing the compulsion to splurge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Ultimately, anyone can lose weight in a calorie deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

This [[alex_hormozis_daily_diet_routine | daily diet routine]], consistently adjusted for specific goals, allows for [[balancing_dessert_and_fitness | dessert]] while maintaining fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

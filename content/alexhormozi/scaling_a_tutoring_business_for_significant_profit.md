From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

Tutoring, particularly test prep, is presented as a highly profitable business model that can be started with minimal capital and operated flexibly, even by students, with the potential to earn over $1,100 per day in profit within four hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This business was considered as one of three before deciding to start a gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It can even be scaled to generate a million dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The "Outcome, Not Service" Approach

The key to successful test prep and tutoring is to sell the *outcome*, not just the tutoring hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This outcome is typically entry into a better job or the ability to pass a test, ideally a standardized test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Getting into a better college or business school through improved test scores can significantly impact a person's network, job recruitment opportunities, and average salary/earning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. College itself was historically seen as a business opportunity where attendees would earn more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Pricing should reflect the potential for students to earn $100,000 more per year by attending better schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Operational Model: Semi-Private Tutoring

The most profitable service model, especially for those with time constraints, is semi-private, 1-to-many tutoring, rather than 1-on-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Why 1-to-Many?
Semi-private groups allow charging two-thirds of the 1-on-1 rate but serving eight times as many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A group of eight students still allows for a small group setting and personalized attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Earning Potential
Consider the following comparison:
*   **1-on-1 Model:** At $60/hour, four hours of work yields $240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **1-on-8 Model:** Charging $35 per person for a group of eight means $280 per hour ($35 * 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Over four hours, this totals $1,120 in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This represents four and a half times more money per unit of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This [[earning_potential_with_a_tutoring_side_hustle | earning potential]] can surpass that of a doctor, without requiring medical school or student loans, and still allow for a full day of freedom, working perhaps from 6 PM to 10 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Tutoring sessions can be conducted at free libraries, reducing overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Packaging Sessions
It is preferable to have clients prepay for sessions to avoid transactional one-off engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The number of problems a student solves statistically correlates with score improvement (e.g., 1,000 problems for an extra 20 points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The sales pitch should focus on the desired score increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Curriculum and Repeatability

Test prep is extremely repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Research indicates that standardized test scores (like SATs and GMATs) are directly proportional to the number of problems solved before the test, making it a clear input-output equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

A suggested curriculum structure involves:
1.  A three-day curriculum taught to Class A and Class B separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  A makeup day for students who fell behind, where they still pay the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Students should be given homework, with a billing incentive if they don't complete it, to motivate them to do the work and achieve better scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The speaker personally improved their GMAT score above Harvard's threshold by solving every available problem book over four months, working four hours a day, and taking weekly practice tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Getting Started: Initial Client Acquisition

This business can achieve top one percent earnings with no upfront capital, rental space, or build-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Initial Outreach
1.  **Network:** Contact your personal network, dM high school students and parents you know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Personal Story:** Share your own test score improvement (e.g., "moved my score from X to Y") and how it led to a better college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Present your method and the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
3.  **Free Session/Assessment:** Offer a free session to demonstrate your method. This acts as a half-assessment and sales pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Show an easy win for the student early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
4.  **The "Big Three" Ask:** After the free session, ask for:
    *   Feedback on improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   A testimonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   A referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
5.  **Leverage Testimonials:** Post testimonials online and invite engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. DM those who engage with offers (e.g., "my next 10 clients get half off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
6.  **Broader Outreach:** Reach out to people you don't know and consider running ads later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
7.  **Sports Teams:** Approach sports teams whose members may need to meet academic thresholds for scholarships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This can lead to quick word-of-mouth spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Building a student base to earn $1,000-$1,100 per day could take around six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## "Super Saiyan" Scaling for Significant Profit

To achieve "Super Saiyan" level [[scaling_a_servicebased_business | scaling]], delegate the core tutoring work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This is part of [[scaling_the_unscalable_in_business | scaling the unscalable]] by building a system.

### Leveraging Other Teachers
The goal is to become proficient at signing up students, then templatize the problem-solving process that predictably increases scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Delegation:** Hire teachers for $50/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Many teachers would be happy with this rate, as it can be more than their regular job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins:** Aim for 80% or higher service-based margins, meaning costs per unit (e.g., teacher's pay) are below 56% of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you charge $280/hour per group and pay a teacher $50/hour, you make the spread of $230/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Reinvest Time:** The four hours previously spent tutoring can now be dedicated to promotion, marketing, selling, and finding more teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This demonstrates [[leverage_and_scaling_in_business_growth | leverage and scaling in business growth]].

### Building Pipelines and Achieving Million-Dollar Income
Establish pipelines for student acquisition and teacher recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Ask existing teachers for referrals ("Do you have any other teacher friends who would be good at this?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

To achieve "God mode" [[scaling_businesses_quickly | scaling]]:
*   Employ four teachers, each earning $50/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   You still make your $280/hour per group, but now across four groups simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   This results in approximately $1,100 per hour in gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   For a four-hour day, this is $4,400 in gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   After paying each of the four teachers $200 (4 hours * $50), total teacher cost is $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Net profit: $4,400 - $800 = $3,600 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

With $3,600 profit per day, you exceed the $3,300 per day needed to make a million dollars a year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This puts you above the top one percent of earners, operating with just four part-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

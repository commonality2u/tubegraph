Acquiring customers for small businesses is crucial, and the fundamental principle for business growth is to make potential customers aware of your offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. If no one knows about your product or service, no one will buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. Effective [[Strategies for business growth through advertising and sales | advertising]] is essential to this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

A key concept is that doubling your leads generally doubles your business, assuming all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:26">[07:28:26]</a>. The ability to consistently generate [[Lead generation and conversion | leads]] provides endless opportunities to refine your approach and succeed in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## The Core Four Advertising Methods

There are four primary ways to let people know about your products or services, referred to as "the core four" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:33">[28:51:33]</a>:

### 1. Warm Outreach
Warm Outreach involves reaching out directly to people who already know you, typically on a one-to-one basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This method is reliable, low-risk, repeatable, and low-cost, making it ideal for securing initial customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.

*   **Origin:** The speaker's first business, a fitness non-profit, started by contacting 101 friends, resulting in six initial participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. These participants later became paying clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** It's used for getting the first five customers, subsequent customers, or launching new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. For a book launch, the speaker used warm outreach to invite friends to the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Platforms:** Email, phone calls, direct messages, physical mail, voicemails, and various social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content
This method involves posting content to a known audience on a one-to-many basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

*   **Origin:** After exhausting warm outreach, the speaker began posting about client results and fitness content online, then messaged anyone who interacted, leading to 20 new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** Posting free content grows your audience, which naturally leads to more buyers, and also enhances the effectiveness of other [[Strategies for gaining leads across industries | lead generation methods]] by building trust and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>.
*   **Content Framework:** The "Hook, Retain, Reward" framework is used to maximize engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Hook:** Capture attention (e.g., using five unique topic buckets, seven timeless themes for headlines, structured for sharing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Retain:** Keep attention (e.g., using lists, steps, and stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Reward:** Satisfy the reason for consumption (elegantly deliver on promises at the right times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>.
*   **Results:** The speaker's content strategy for a book launch involved over 300 pieces per week across multiple platforms, generating over 400 million impressions and 194,000 registrations, equivalent to millions in free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>.
*   **Platforms:** YouTube (Shorts, Longs), podcasts, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram (stories, reels, posts), Twitter, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

### 3. Running Paid Ads
Paid ads involve letting strangers know about your offerings on a one-to-many basis, and are the fastest way to get leads, even with no existing following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.

*   **Origin:** The speaker learned about Facebook ads at a marketing seminar, and an ugly, text-only ad for a free six-week challenge generated 29 members before a gym even opened, saving the business from immediate failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** Paid ads are scalable and can start with a few dollars a day, growing to millions per week across a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ad Framework:** The "What, Who, When" framework is used for scripting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.
*   **Results:** For a book launch, paid ads spent $275,000, bringing in 137,000 leads at a cost of about $2 per lead, significantly lower than the industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>.
*   **Platforms:** YouTube (Shorts, Longs), Facebook, Instagram (reels, stories, posts), TikTok, Hulu, radio, LinkedIn, Spotify, Twitter, podcasts, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>.

### 4. Cold Outreach
Cold Outreach involves privately letting people who don't know you know about your stuff, advertising one-to-one to strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>.

*   **Origin:** During the COVID-19 pandemic when 100% of the speaker's gym clients were impacted, a conversation with a former salesperson revealed the power of cold outbound for customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. This method saved the gym launch business during its hardest time, eventually contributing to over 50% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** It can start with a tiny budget, requiring only time, a way to contact people, and a strategy for what to say when they reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>. It's scalable using other people's time and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>. You can pick highly qualified targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
*   **Platforms:** SMS, DMs, emails, LinkedIn Messenger, Instagram Messenger, Twitter Messenger, voicemail, physical mail, and carrier pigeons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Lead Getters for Accelerated Growth

While you can perform the "core four" methods yourself, you can also leverage "lead getters"â€”other people who advertise on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>. This provides significantly higher leverage, meaning less work for more leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>. The strategy is to use the core four to acquire lead getters, who then use the core four to get customers for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

The four types of lead getters are:

*   **Customers:** Existing customers can refer new ones, often through [[Acquiring customers for small businesses | warm outreach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>. The speaker's first book, "100 Million Dollar Offers," sold 467,000 copies with zero paid ads, primarily through customer referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.
*   **Employees:** Your team can create and distribute content, run ads, or perform outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. For the book launch, the speaker's team created over 2,200 pieces of content in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>.
*   **Agencies:** External agencies can run ads or do outreach on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. For the book launch, an agency managed the paid advertising campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.
*   **Affiliates:** Independent businesses that promote your products to their audience in exchange for compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. Affiliates leverage their own advertising efforts (using the core four) to generate leads for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:24:00">[58:24:00]</a>. For the book launch, 23,722 affiliates promoted the event to over 10 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

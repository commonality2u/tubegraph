One of the fastest ways to generate substantial revenue in a service business is by strategically combining different types of offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy applies to any business that provides or sells [[different_types_of_products_and_services | products]] to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Acquisition.com, for example, generates about $85 million in annual [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | revenue]] by implementing such approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Categories of Business Offerings

Businesses can categorize their offerings into three main types:
1.  **Products**: These are tangible or digital goods that customers receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   **Physical Products**: Items received in the mail, such as supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   **Digital Products**: Goods consumed digitally, like a Netflix subscription (media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  **Services**: These involve people performing actions or tasks for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   **Physical Services**: Experiences like a massage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Digital Services**: Services delivered online, such as those provided by a marketing agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
3.  **Access**: This grants individuals entry to a person, an experience, or an exclusive sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Physical Access**: Like concert tickets, providing entry to an event or a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   **Digital Access**: Entry to virtual events or direct communication channels (e.g., Slack access to an expert) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Enhancing Value Through Combination

To make an offering more [[value_creation_and_the_value_equation | valuable]] and avoid being a commodity, businesses should consider combining these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The goal is to differentiate your business to such an extent that you become a standalone entity with "monopoly prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

For example:
*   A physical [[different_types_of_products_and_services | product]] business could add digital products to enhance its [[the_importance_of_providing_value | value]] and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   A physical [[different_types_of_products_and_services | service]] business could integrate digital components, physical products, or digital products into its offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### The High [[the_importance_of_providing_value | Value]] of "Access"

Among the three categories, [[value_creation_and_the_value_equation | access]] is particularly valuable, especially digital access, which boasts almost 100% margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Digital products also have nearly 100% margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. In contrast, [[different_types_of_products_and_services | services]] are harder to scale due to the complexities of managing people, culture, training, and onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. To [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | increase business value]], integrating multiple types of offerings is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The "Access" Hack for Fast Cash Flow

One of the easiest and fastest ways to generate cash flow, especially when facing financial constraints, is to leverage [[value_creation_and_the_value_equation | access]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This strategy involves [[selling_highvalue_products_and_services | selling a more individualized, higher-touch version]] of your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Key Elements of an "Access" Offer:

*   **Limited Capacity**: Offer a small number of slots (e.g., five people) for a one-on-one or small group experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Defined Outcome**: Focus on a specific, highly desired outcome that the clients will achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Success**: Provide a guarantee, such as "I'll keep working with you for free until you achieve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This reassures customers that their investment ensures the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Upfront Payment**: Require clients to prepay for the entire period to generate immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This type of offer doesn't require a discount; its [[value_creation_and_the_value_equation | value]] comes from the exclusive [[value_creation_and_the_value_equation | access]] in addition to the [[different_types_of_products_and_services | service]] and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It's an effective way to generate five, ten, twenty, or even fifty thousand dollars depending on your business size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Maintaining Demand and Goodwill

When implementing this strategy, it's crucial to maintain "pent-up demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Instead of selling all available slots (e.g., 100), sell only a fraction (e.g., 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This leaves the vast majority (80%) of the demand still present, ensuring that future offers will also sell out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Always strive to keep some goodwill in reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. By continually growing your base of potential customers and only "skimming a tiny amount off the top," you ensure sustained sales without exhausting your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This approach is more sustainable than constantly trying to liquidate all demand and then rebuilding it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Utilizing access offers allows for implied urgency and scarcity with a very [[selling_highvalue_products_and_services | high-ticket premium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. It often attracts the best customers who are less demanding and lead to excellent testimonials and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The rapid advancement and [[accessibility_of_ai_with_chat_gpt | accessibility of AI]], particularly with tools like Chat GPT, necessitate serious consideration of regulations and ethical guidelines to manage its profound impact on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Need for Regulation

AI is described as a force that will only grow "more dangerous and Powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. There have been ongoing efforts to "slow down AI" and "regulate AI" for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Key questions that require regulatory answers for the future include:
*   **Access Control** Who will determine who gets access to superintelligence, which will become the "most valuable resource on planet Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>?
*   **Content Governance** What will govern the types of prompts and queries that users can ask AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>? For instance, preventing AI from answering malicious queries like "how do I wipe out the entire human race for less than $100,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that there "is going to have to be some regulation around this because the thing is that's a lot of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Aligning AI with Human Goals

Figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman are working to "align our goals of humanity with the goals of the AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This alignment is considered the "only really productive thought process we can have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Despite the fear, technological progress is unlikely to be stopped, even if banned, due to the nature of the internet and "black hat coders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. AI is likened to "the new nuclear bomb of this Century or this Millennia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, underscoring the critical importance of careful development.

> "if Humanity collectivity decides that creating digital super intelligence is The Right Move then we should do so very very carefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
> "this is the most important thing that we could possibly do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Social and Economic Considerations

One significant ethical and societal consideration is the [[impact_of_ai_on_work_and_economy | impact of AI on work and the economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. With AI potentially eliminating large cost bases and thus the money that would circulate through the economy via wages, there will be "significant changes to capitalism overall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been conducting the "largest UBI study" (Universal Basic Income) concurrently with the development of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This suggests an awareness of the potential economic displacement and the need for new social safety nets. The development of AI presents an "opportunity to push the reset button and think about the world we want," with Universal Basic Income being a potential part of that vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

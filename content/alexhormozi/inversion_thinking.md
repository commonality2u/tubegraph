[[the_concept_of_reversing_engineering_value | Inversion thinking]] is an [[effective_problemsolving_techniques | effective problemsolving techniques]] popularized by Charlie Munger, a personal hero to the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Munger delivered a seminal talk on "how to live a miserable life" to illustrate this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Definition and Process

[[the_concept_of_reversing_engineering_value | Inversion thinking]] involves solving problems in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Instead of asking "How do I have a good marriage?", one would ask "How would I destroy my marriage?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. After listing all the ways to destroy it, the next step is to do the exact opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Why it Works

Our brains are inherently better at identifying problems and threats than they are at finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This is an innate, evolutionarily designed ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. By harnessing this natural inclination to foresee every possible problem and threat, one can then [[the_concept_of_reversing_engineering_value | flip that in reverse]] to discover solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Applications

This thinking process can be applied to various aspects of life, including:
*   Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Personal merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>
*   Career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>
*   Body/Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>

By focusing on how to destroy these areas, and then doing the opposite, success can be achieved "by accident" through avoiding common pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. The key is to concentrate on not making "stupid mistakes" that most people commonly do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## The 28 Ways to Stay Poor (and Their Inversions)

The speaker presents "28 ways to stay poor" as a direct application of [[the_concept_of_reversing_engineering_value | inversion thinking]] to [[mindset_changes_for_achieving_financial_goals | mindset changes for achieving financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. By understanding how to remain poor, one can then reverse these behaviors to achieve financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

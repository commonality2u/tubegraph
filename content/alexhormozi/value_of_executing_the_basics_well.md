Many businesses can achieve significant success by consistently executing fundamental tasks, as competitors often fail to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. While business growth can be challenging due to unexpected complexities, the [[the_value_of_focused_effort_and_consistency_in_personal_growth | singularity of focus]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">00:00:11</a>.

## The Distraction Trap

Opportunities can be a major distraction, and as a business grows, these opportunities become larger and harder to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>. This phenomenon can be likened to the "woman in the red dress" from *The Matrix*, an analogy for shiny new objects or tempting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">00:00:25</a>. At every stage of business, these distractions become more attractive, requiring entrepreneurs to repeatedly learn how to say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">00:01:00</a>.

## Innovation vs. Execution

While innovation is important to a small degree, the vast majority of business success stems from diligently performing the tasks you already know you should be doing, but often neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">00:01:18</a>. A friend with 60 businesses making eight figures annually illustrates this; when asked how easy it would be to grow just one business, he admitted it would be effortless to scale it to $30-50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">00:01:26</a>. This realization led him to shut down multiple ventures to focus on the largest opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>.

Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, did not have side hustles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">00:02:02</a>. Success often comes from doing one thing exceptionally well and pursuing it fully without distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">00:02:05</a>. As Neil Strauss observed, success is about "doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">00:02:22</a>. It's the depth and nuance of understanding how to do something that pays dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">00:02:28</a>.

Before seeking new ventures or "exciting add-ons," entrepreneurs should ensure they are mastering the basics, such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">00:02:40</a>:
*   Being present on all relevant platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">00:02:40</a>
*   Consistent email marketing and [[the_importance_of_providing_value | providing value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">00:02:44</a>
*   Building out website SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">00:02:48</a>
*   Developing sales training for high execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">00:02:52</a>

Being "advanced" in business means never neglecting the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">00:03:06</a>. Big businesses perform the same basic functions as small businesses, but they execute them better and "fill the holes in the bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>.

## Prioritizing "Better," "More," Then "New"

Think of a business as a bucket with water flowing in (traffic/eyeballs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">00:03:23</a>. To grow, the logical steps are:
1.  **Fix the holes** in your existing bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">00:03:37</a>.
2.  **Increase the flow** to that bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">00:03:41</a>.
3.  Only once those are maximized, **add new flows** or new buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">00:03:45</a>.

The guiding principle should be "better, more, new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">00:03:51</a>. Always prioritize "better" because it carries the lowest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">00:04:04</a>. This means:
*   Doing what you're currently doing, but better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">00:04:07</a>
*   Following up faster and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">00:04:08</a>
*   Creating better copy and creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">00:04:10</a>
*   Optimizing your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">00:04:11</a>
*   Hiring and training better people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">00:04:12</a>
*   Implementing superior management and incentive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">00:04:14</a>

This process may sound "boring," but it is how large businesses are built by filling all known deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">00:04:18</a>. Instead of pursuing new ventures, entrepreneurs should make a list of the 25 obvious actions that would generate more revenue and execute those first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">00:04:27</a>.

## The Spiritual Difficulty of Focusing

Entrepreneurs often fall into the trap of constantly starting new things because initial success with a "new" idea (like finding product-market fit) positively reinforces that behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">00:04:58</a>. However, this lesson must be unlearned: starting new things can lead to punishment rather than reward as the business scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">00:05:11</a>. Once product-market fit is achieved, the focus should shift from "new" to "better" and "more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">00:05:21</a>.

## Consequences of Diversion

Businesses grow by default and outcompete others by executing everything their rivals do, but better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">00:05:45</a>. When entrepreneurs divert resources from their core operations to new ventures, the existing business suffers from atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">00:05:51</a>. Costs for media and talent rise, and if the core business isn't continually improved, it deteriorates relative to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">00:06:23</a>. This leads to having multiple "buckets" (businesses) filled with holes, lacking the capacity to fix any of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">00:06:36</a>.

## Execution is Harder than Strategy

Strategy is often easy and exciting, leading people to allocate too much attention and time to new ideas rather than executing obvious truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">00:07:07</a>. For instance, a dry cleaning business that always delivers clean clothes on time will be exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">00:07:12</a>. The difficulty lies in consistent execution, not in conceptualizing the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">00:07:18</a>.

When growing a business, focus on what you "need to believe" will remain constant over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">00:07:40</a>. For example, people will always want things fast, good products, and good service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">00:07:43</a>. In "boring" industries like dry cleaning or lawn care, you often aren't competing with the "smartest people in the world" who are focused on building the "next platform" in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">00:08:00</a>. This presents an opportunity to dominate by simply mastering the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">00:08:11</a>.

The true "advanced" skill is not understanding the basics, but how well you execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">00:08:18</a>. It's about training, recruiting, incentivizing, and continually reviewing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">00:08:27</a>.

### The "Don't Be Cute" Principle

A seasoned mercenary CEO emphasized "simple backyard football" over "super fancy trick plays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">00:09:34</a>. Consistent yardage is more effective than risky, complicated maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">00:09:50</a>. This means focusing on core needs like clean clothes, fast service, and good quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">00:10:07</a>. If you execute these fundamentals for ten years, filling every hole, your business will grow by default because competitors won't maintain that focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">00:10:11</a>. Business is not complicated; it's difficult because people struggle to stay focused on the same thing for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">00:10:20</a>.

## The Compounding Clock

Those who achieve significant wealth often do so by committing to and doing the same thing for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">00:10:40</a>. Ben Francis, founder of Gymshark, built a billion-dollar company by focusing on one venture for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">00:10:52</a>. The "compounding clock" starts when you commit to doing one thing better and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">00:11:09</a>. It is arrogant to believe you can outperform fully focused competitors when your efforts are split across multiple ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">00:11:41</a>.

Many entrepreneurs try to juggle multiple businesses, hoping one "takes off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">00:12:41</a>. However, none will take off if focus is divided, as any could succeed with dedicated attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">00:12:44</a>. A roofing business owner, for example, might also operate in real estate, general contracting, and windows, believing they are "vertically integrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">00:13:00</a>. In reality, they are simply distracted, while the biggest roofing companies are billion-dollar enterprises built on scaling one core service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">00:13:19</a>.

Scaling and earning significant money comes from the depth and detail gained by repeatedly doing the same thing, leading to compounding returns and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">00:13:29</a>. A person with split focus will never become truly proficient at any single thing, leading to "barely good enough" results and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">00:13:36</a>. If you're not making money, it's often because you don't understand your business well enough compared to top performers in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">00:13:41</a>. The path to success is to rapidly eliminate ignorance in one area, rather than spreading it across many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">00:13:50</a>.

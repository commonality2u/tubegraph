The Sales to Fulfillment Continuum is a concept that generally states: the easier something is to sell, the harder it is to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Conversely, if something is very hard to sell (e.g., "you have to do it all yourself"), it is typically very easy to deliver on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## Exceptions

The main exception to this general rule is technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. However, for services, the principle usually holds: an offer that promises to "do everything for you" is easy to sell but hard to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## The "Done For You," "Done With You," "Do It Yourself" Pyramid

When considering a new product or service, the recommended approach is to follow what is called the "Tesla Model" â€“ starting at the top of the pyramid with the most expensive offering first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This strategy integrates with the principle of [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | scaling the unscalable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### 1. Done For You (Top of the Pyramid)

*   **Characteristics**: This is the most expensive offering, where the business handles everything for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Sales & Fulfillment**: Very easy to sell, but very hard to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Maximizes revenue per customer, especially when starting out with limited lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
    *   Allows for the highest percentage of people to achieve the best results, building strong customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
    *   Develops Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and identifies core products, which are crucial for later productizing the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. For example, an agency doing "done for you" will create SOPs for lead magnets, ads, landing pages, and email follow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
    *   Establishes strong brand positioning and price anchoring for the most expensive version of the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: More difficult to scale, but acceptable in the initial phase when customer numbers are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Engaging in one-on-one calls and hands-on work with customers in the beginning is essential for learning and improving the product and offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This "unscalable" effort provides valuable insights into pain points, effective messaging, and what customers truly value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### 2. Done With You (Middle Tier)

*   **Characteristics**: After developing SOPs from the "done for you" phase, the business transitions to a "done with you" model, where they assist the client in doing the work themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This shifts from a service provider to a consulting relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Sales & Fulfillment**: Can be sold at a fraction of the "done for you" price (e.g., a third or fifth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The service is largely productized, requiring less direct handholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: Allows for selling to many more people (e.g., 10 times the amount of people) due to reduced support requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:19:00]</a>. This is a step towards [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | scaling the service]] from one-on-one interactions to semi-private or group settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 3. Do It Yourself (Bottom of the Pyramid)

*   **Characteristics**: The most accessible and lowest-priced tier, providing clients with SOPs and resources to perform the work entirely on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Sales & Fulfillment**: Typically one-tenth or one-third the price of "done with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. It's harder to sell at this level due to minimal direct involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: Offers the highest scalability, as it leverages the codified knowledge from the earlier stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Why the Top-Down Approach?

The top-down approach (starting with "done for you") is preferred because:
*   It incurs the least operational drag at the start due to fewer customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   It allows the business owner to deeply understand the customer, their problems, and effective messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, which improves [[sales_and_product_development | sales skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   It facilitates the creation of robust systems and [[sales_team_scaling_strategies | training material]] that can then be used to scale down to less personalized, higher-volume offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   It enables a small business to leverage its unique advantage of providing highly personalized, initially "unscalable" services to outcompete larger, less agile competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

This approach ensures that a business learns more than it earns in the beginning, fast-tracking its education on the customer and the problems it solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It emphasizes prioritizing [[efficiency_in_the_sales_process | efficiency per lead]] and pulling out "all the stops" when starting small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This perspective is a core principle in [[entrepreneurship_and_selling_strategies | entrepreneurship]], promoting proactive engagement in seemingly "unscalable" tasks to build a foundation for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

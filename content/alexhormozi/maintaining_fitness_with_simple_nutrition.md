This article outlines a straightforward approach to [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting and nutrition strategies]] that has allowed for consistent fitness maintenance, including a six-pack, for over 20 years, even with daily dessert consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While not based on extensive scientific research, this method is presented as what has personally worked and been adopted by many entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Principles

The underlying philosophy is to determine an individual's specific goal and then strategically allocate calories, prioritizing protein intake. This method allows for significant flexibility, accommodating social events like business dinners and drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal

The first step is to identify your objective: are you trying to gain size (get bigger) or lose weight (get smaller)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Step 2: Calculate Your Daily Calorie Target

Once your goal is set, multiply your body weight by a coefficient ranging from 7 to 21 to determine your daily calorie target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **7-9:** Extreme Weight Loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **10-12:** Moderate Weight Loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
    *   *Example:* A 200 lb person aiming for moderate cut would use a coefficient of 10, resulting in 2,000 calories (200 lbs * 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **13-15:** Maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
    *   *Example:* For maintenance, a 200 lb person might use a coefficient of 15, resulting in 3,000 calories (200 lbs * 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **16-18:** Moderate Weight Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **19-21:** Extreme Weight Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

This calculation accounts for factors like exercise and physical jobs, making the system adaptable; if weight loss is too fast, simply adjust the coefficient upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Step 3: Determine Your Protein Intake

Multiply your body weight by one to determine your protein intake in grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   *Example:* A 200 lb person needs 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The source notes that a pound of lean meat (e.g., white fish, ground turkey breast, ground beef, shrimp) provides approximately 100 grams of protein, so 200 grams of protein would require 2 pounds of meat if exclusively from that source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The speaker prefers to exceed this 1 gram per pound rule because protein is filling and makes him feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Step 4: Allocate Remaining Calories

Once protein intake is determined and its associated calories are calculated, subtract those calories from your daily total. The remaining calories are "flex calories" that can be used for any other foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   *Example:* If a 200 lb person consumes 2 pounds of turkey (560 calories each for 1120 calories total protein from 200g of protein) and has a 2,000-calorie daily target, 880 calories remain for other foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   These 880 calories could be spent on two cocktails (150 calories each) and a 500-calorie meal, or an entire pint of ice cream, or two 400-calorie cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This demonstrates the [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexible eating and understanding body type]] principle.

This flexible approach allows for enjoying dessert almost every night and still maintaining a six-pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This aligns with [[balancing_dessert_and_fitness | balancing dessert and fitness]].

## [[alex_hormozis_daily_diet_routine | Alex Hormozi's Daily Diet Routine]]

The speaker shares his specific daily meal structure, which includes the same breakfast and lunch every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

*   **Breakfast:** A 200-calorie bar (e.g., Quest Bar) with 20g of protein, and a shake (160 calories, 30g protein), totaling 360 calories and 50g of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Lunch:** One pound of turkey (560 calories, 100g protein) and half a cup of rice, bringing the total for breakfast and lunch to 1140 calories and 150g of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Dinner:** This is the "big flex meal," allowing for significant calorie and food choices based on the remaining allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The speaker often eats another pound of protein at dinner, prioritizing feeling full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

This system provides a framework for [[unconventional_diet_explanation | unconventional diet explanation]] by focusing on macro targets rather than strict food lists. It addresses [[common_misconceptions_about_diets | common misconceptions about diets]] by showing that indulgent foods can be part of a fitness plan. The speaker also mentions taking a multivitamin for greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This nutrition plan emphasizes [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | achieving success through consistent behaviors]] and has helped others achieve significant weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While the focus of this article is nutrition, there is potential for a follow-up discussion on [[training_routines_and_exercise_variations | training routines and exercise variations]] for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

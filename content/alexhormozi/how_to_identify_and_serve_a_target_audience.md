This article outlines a five-part framework for identifying your business idea, defining your target audience, crafting your service approach, and developing a compelling message to acquire your first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This process has proven effective, with over one out of two people starting a paid community on School.com making their first dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Part 1: The "What" - Your Business Idea

The first step is to determine what your business will be about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This can be identified using the "Three P's Framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

### The Three P's Framework
Most businesses originate from one of these three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

1.  **Pain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>: Something you personally experienced and had to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A friend's wife developed a system for efficiently preparing lunch for nine children, turning a personal struggle into a business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Profession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>: What you do or have done for a day job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Any professional skill for which people exchange money can be the basis for a consulting or independent contractor business, or for teaching others in that profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A registered dietitian learned a complex insurance billing system due to long hospital hours and then taught other dietitians how to bill insurance, generating significant income from a niche skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  **Passion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>: Topics you're inherently interested in, that you consume content about in your spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   *Example*: The speaker's obsession with fitness led friends to encourage and even offer to fund his gym, demonstrating how a strong passion can naturally lead to a business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Embracing the "Best Bad Idea"
It's crucial to understand that your first business idea doesn't need to be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Picking *anything* is the vital first step, as it initiates the iteration process of gathering feedback and making improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The goal is to reach your "best bad idea" as quickly as possible, allowing you to refine it over time until it becomes a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Part 2: The "Who" - Identifying Your Audience

Once you have your "what," the next step is to define "who" you will serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Your target audience will fall into one of three categories:

1.  **People Like You** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>: These are individuals facing similar challenges or having similar aspirations to your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Sarah Blakely created Spanx to solve a personal problem with existing underwear, leading to a billion-dollar business by serving "people like her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect college students, a demographic he was part of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
2.  **People You've Helped Before** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>: This could be for money or as a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   *Example*: The speaker's first dollar came from a woman at the gym who sought his help with food, demonstrating that informal assistance can reveal a viable business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **People Who Are Underserved** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>: This involves identifying growing markets with high demand and unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

> [!INFO] Missionaries vs. Mercenaries
> Businesses started by helping "people like you" often create "missionaries" â€“ founders who deeply care about the product and customer experience because they understand the pain firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This contrasts with "mercenaries" who start businesses purely based on market analysis and trends, primarily driven by money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Focusing on a problem you've overcome fosters a commitment to an exceptional product and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Defining Your Avatar
To get clear on your target audience, think about them using "five frames" and aim to pick at least three to define them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:
*   Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Problems/Pains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Interests/Passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

*Example*: "35-year-old male accountants who are bored at their jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The goal is to be narrow enough that your audience knows you're talking to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

> [!TIP] [[understanding_and_leveraging_audience_targeting | Narrowing Your Niche Increases Price]]
> A common misconception is that getting very specific with your target audience will limit your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The opposite is true: the more specific you get, the more you can charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
>
> *Example*:
> *   "Time management" (broad): ~$19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
> *   "Time management for salespeople": ~$199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
> *   "Time management for outbound salespeople": ~$1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
> *   "Outbound time management system for garden and power tools sales": ~$10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
>
> By becoming the best in a highly specific niche, you operate in a "blue ocean" with few competitors, allowing you to charge premium prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Part 3: The "How" - Serving Your Audience

This section covers how you will help your target audience, focusing on both the positive outcomes you deliver and the negative experiences you help them avoid.

### How Part 1: The Upside (Good Stuff)
Describe all the positive achievements and experiences your customers will gain by using your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Focus on:
*   How much easier their lives will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   How guaranteed the outcome is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   How much faster they will achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   How it would feel to experience their dream scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

These elements are the positive inverse of the value equation: an ideal offer is incredibly easy, guaranteed, immediate, and exactly what the customer wants, delivered exactly how they want it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### How Part 2: The Downside (Bad Stuff to Avoid)
To motivate people, you can either offer good things or help them avoid bad things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Focus on the inverse of the upside, describing the risks, slowness, pain, sacrifice, and suffering your product helps them avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Risks**: What negative outcomes will they avoid? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>
*   **Slowness**: How will your solution prevent delays and inefficiency? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
*   **Pain/Sacrifice**: What difficult or unwanted actions will they *not* have to take? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a> This includes things they normally have to *give up* but no longer will, and bad things they would normally have to *start doing* but won't with your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Specificity is Key
> The more specific you are about both the pain and the benefit, the more likely your audience is to believe you and feel you understand them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
> *Example*: Instead of "lose weight fast," say "stop feeling your thighs chafing when you're out in the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This level of detail bypasses "banner blindness" because it resonates deeply with personal pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Gathering Information: The "Ask" Method
If you're serving people unlike yourself, the best way to understand their upsides and downsides is to "ask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Conduct interviews by asking questions like:
*   What problems are you struggling with? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>
*   How long have you struggled with them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
*   What makes it painful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>
*   Describe your ideal experience if it were done the right way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   What things do you have to stop doing that you like doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>
*   What things have you had to start doing that you hate doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>

The answers to these questions will form the basis of the "good stuff" you help them get and the "bad stuff" you help them avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Part 4: Putting It All Together - The Message

This is the "Mr. Miyagi moment" where everything comes together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Use the "Osim Money Mad Lib" formula to craft your core message:

`I help [WHO] get [GOOD STUFF] without [BAD STUFF] (through [UNIQUE MECHANISM - optional])` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>

*   **WHO**: Your narrow target audience (from Part 2, combining "what" and "who") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **GOOD STUFF**: The upside and desired outcomes (from How Part 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **BAD STUFF**: The pains and sacrifices they avoid (from How Part 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **(through UNIQUE MECHANISM)**: Your proprietary process or methodology (covered in Bonus 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This part is optional, especially if you're just starting and don't yet have a unique process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

*Examples*:
*   "I help 35-year-old male accountants get a new income stream without being bored at their jobs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>
*   "I help 45-year-old women who just had kids get back into their high school jeans without giving up time with their family." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>
*   "I help non-fiction business authors get on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list without looking cringe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>

The goal is to nail the message so precisely that the person thinks, "Shoot, that's me!" and acknowledges it's exactly what they're struggling with and what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. This is critical for [[branding_and_audience_engagement | branding and audience engagement]].

## Bonus 1: The Unique Mechanism

A unique mechanism is something that differentiates your solution from others in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. It's your "special sauce" that makes prospects feel that your process is the missing piece they needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Your unique mechanism can be:
*   A list or checklist of things someone must do to achieve a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   A series of steps that must be followed in sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

Once you have this process, you wrap it up and give it a unique name. This becomes your proprietary process and your unique mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

*Examples of Unique Mechanisms*:
*   P90X's "muscle confusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>
*   Weight Watchers' "point system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>

Think of your unique mechanism as the "vehicle" that transports your customers from their current state to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## Bonus 2: Getting Your First Five Customers

This simple system leverages your newly crafted message:

1.  **Greet Someone**: Say hello <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  **Compliment Them**: Mention something specific and positive about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
3.  **Insert Your Message**: State the clear "I help WHO get GOOD STUFF without BAD STUFF" sentence you developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
4.  **Ask for Referrals**: Ask if they know anyone who could benefit from what you offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Perform this outreach for four hours per day or until you reach 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Consistently applying this process is designed to help you acquire your first five customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. This strategy is also known as "warm outreach" and is a key tactic for [[tactics_for_producing_targeted_content_for_business_owners | producing targeted content for business owners]] and [[building_a_brand_from_zero_audience | building a brand from zero audience]].

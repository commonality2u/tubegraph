A strategy for online course success involves giving away significant amounts of free content to establish legitimacy and attract qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This approach contrasts with scam businesses that make unrealistic income promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Strategy: Give Away Secrets, Sell Implementation

The smart move is to [[importance_of_offering_initial_products_or_services_for_free | give away the secrets]] (the educational content itself) and sell the implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This means taking all the content that would normally be sold as a course and making it available for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

For example, if selling the ability to sell, one would [[utilizing_free_content_for_lead_generation | give away the sales course as content]] across various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The implementation, which is the paid service, would involve personalized feedback, like listening to sales calls, providing real-time feedback, and monitoring performance over time to develop a salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Benefits of High-Quality Free Content

By [[strategies_for_content_creation_and_media_engagement | generating more content]] that is superior to competitors' paid offerings, businesses can:

*   **Maintain Thought Leadership** [[leveraging_content_and_outreach_to_increase_business_profitability | Maintaining thought leadership]] solidifies an organization's position as an authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Influence Market Perception** The marketplace naturally concludes that if free content is better than competitors' paid content, then the paid offerings must also be superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This helps in [[how_to_create_compelling_offers | creating compelling offers]] for paid services.
*   **Increase Demand** By setting high standards and focusing on quality, demand for the service will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Over time, even with a smaller graduating class, such as 25 "killer" salespeople after a year, their success will generate further demand from companies and their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The success of graduates making significantly more than industry averages, supported by data, justifies higher pricing for the education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

This strategy, when combined with careful student selection (not accepting 90% of applicants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, [[using_data_and_metrics_to_establish_credibility_in_online_courses | data-based expectation setting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, and a willingness to not graduate everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, leads to a legitimate education business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It allows businesses to charge premium prices by demonstrating clear value and results, similar to established institutions like Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

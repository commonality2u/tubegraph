Aspiring [[entrepreneurship_and_business_growth_mindset | entrepreneurs]] often ask, "What should I sell?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> The universe of things that can be sold is surprisingly limited, consisting of seven core categories, each available in digital and physical formats, totaling 14 potential offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Understanding these categories is foundational for [[strategies_for_entrepreneurial_success | entrepreneurial success]] and developing effective [[the_importance_of_building_and_selling_skills_for_entrepreneurs | selling skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Core Categories of Things to Sell

1.  **Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Tangible items like water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Intangible items such as a PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Actions performed for others, like a massage, lawn mowing, or car repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Services delivered in the digital space, such as an ad agency creating ads or buying media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Leasing a building provides physical access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Gaining access to a digital content library, similar to Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
4.  **Attention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   **Physical**: A billboard captures physical attention as cars drive past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Platforms like Facebook and Google sell the digital attention (eyeballs) of their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
5.  **Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Selling insurance for a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Insuring against a cyber threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Businesses can also sell the risk associated with their products by charging for guarantees, like AppleCare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
6.  **Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Actual US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Digital forms of money, such as cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The banking industry is built on buying and selling money, with interest as the charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
7.  **Endorsement or Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
    *   **Physical**: Allowing use of a logo on a shirt for a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Digital**: Selling a verified checkmark on Instagram, which represents an endorsement or status, for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

It's common for offerings to be a combination of these categories; for instance, a rock concert sells access to an experience, but also sells physical products like drinks and t-shirts, and potentially digital recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Choosing What to Sell

The decision of what to sell primarily depends on two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:

1.  **Available Resources**: Consider the capital and tools at your disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For example, with only $100 to start, physical products or complex software might be out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  **Skills, Value, and Experience**: Even first-time [[entrepreneurship_and_business_growth_mindset | entrepreneurs]] possess valuable, often overlooked, experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This can come from:
    *   **Osmosis**: Knowledge gained from being around parents, guardians, or acquaintances in their professions (e.g., knowing about eyes if a parent is an eye surgeon, or carburetors if a parent is a mechanic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   **Past Jobs**: Experiences from odd jobs, even those in high school, provide unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The key is to identify which category you already have experience with and which problem you can solve most effectively given your resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For those with limited starting capital, selling time through services is often a viable initial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The ideal offering is where you provide the most value to the client for the least amount of cost to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Delivery Cube: Enhancing Value and Profitability

Once an offering is established, the "Delivery Cube" provides a framework for enhancing its value and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It consists of six key dimensions:

1.  **Delivery Format**:
    *   **One-to-One**: Personalized delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **Small Group**: Semi-private settings with a few individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   **One-to-Many**: Scaled delivery, like a webinar to a thousand people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Each offers different value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
2.  **Level of Involvement**:
    *   **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)**: Clients perform the work themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is highly scalable but typically lower in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Done-With-You (DWY)**: You guide clients through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This sits between DIY and DFY in terms of scale and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Done-For-You (DFY)**: You complete all the work and deliver a final product or outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This is often the most expensive and sometimes easiest to sell, but hardest to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
3.  **Level and Medium of Support**:
    *   Support can be offered via chat, email, phone call, or Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Email support is more scalable but less valuable than real-time Zoom call support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
4.  **Consumption Method**:
    *   How clients consume the offering (visually, audio, live, recorded, text) impacts perceived value and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Live and in-person consumption is typically perceived as most valuable but least scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Recorded digital content is most scalable but usually least valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
5.  **Speed and Convenience**:
    *   This involves factors like 24/7 availability versus 9-to-5, days per week, and response time (e.g., 24-hour guarantee versus 3-minute response) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Businesses can choose to either overstaff for customer convenience (incurring inefficiency) or maximize staff utilization, making customers wait (incurring customer inefficiency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
6.  **The 10x to 1/10th Test**:
    *   **10x Test**: If you charged 10 times more for your current offering, what would you change to justify the price increase and provide significantly more value? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> This [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | strategy for increasing business value]] encourages thinking about much larger value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   **1/10th Test**: If you had to deliver the same or more value but could only charge one-tenth of the price, what low-cost, high-perceived-value changes would you implement? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> This test helps identify scalable solutions that maintain value while reducing costs, crucial for [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | business growth and scaling strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

By applying these [[strategies_for_entrepreneurial_success | strategies for entrepreneurial success]], entrepreneurs can not only determine what to sell initially but also how to effectively scale and increase the profitability and value of their offerings to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

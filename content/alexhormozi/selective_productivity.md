[[Selective productivity | Selective productivity]] emphasizes that true [[Understanding Productivity through Time Investment | productivity]] stems from the decisions you make **not** to do certain things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It is a framework considered more powerful for [[Defining and optimizing work output | productivity]] than many popular "productivity hacks" that often involve adding more tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Core Concepts

*   **Commitment as Elimination**
    Commitment is defined as the elimination of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For example, marriage eliminates alternatives to a spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Focus as Saying No**
    Focus, in its extreme, means doing literally nothing but one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. A truly focused person performs the fewest possible activities outside of their primary objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Therefore, [[importance_of_saying_no_to_maximize_productivity | focus]] is about the number of things you say "no" to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Practical Application

Achieving [[Defining and optimizing work output | productivity]] through focus involves eliminating distractions, both personal and environmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This includes things like:
*   Minimizing external interruptions (e.g., office windows, knocks on the door) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   Silencing digital notifications (e.g., Slack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

### The Ladder Analogy

Imagine needing to get over a high wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. To gain the critical mass needed to climb over, you build a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The fallacy is attempting to build multiple small ladders (e.g., pursuing three or four different opportunities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The reality is that any one of these opportunities *could* work, but none will succeed unless you commit all your "rungs" (time and effort) to just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

By consolidating your efforts on a single ladder, you can build it high enough to get over the wall and achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Avoiding Diversification

This principle applies across all levels of business, from startups to established enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. A common pitfall is getting bored and wanting to start multiple new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The key to success is to:
*   **Stick with one project**: Imagine someone who improves every year by working on the same project for 20 years; they will become exceptionally good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on the process**: The plans themselves are rarely the problem; it's the lack of commitment to working on and sticking with *one* plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Prioritize a single objective**: Achieving 20 years of practice in one area guarantees proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

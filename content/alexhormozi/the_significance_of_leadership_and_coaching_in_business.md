The common mantra of "no one can outwork me" or focusing solely on hard work for success is often misleading and objectively false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many people are outworked by others and still achieve greater financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While putting in volume and doing the work is essential for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, bragging about work itself is largely irrelevant to achieving the highest levels of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Beyond Hard Work: The Role of Leverage

Highly successful individuals, like Warren Buffett, emphasize strategic decision-making over sheer volume of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Buffett, for instance, considers two good decisions a year a successful year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the idea that working constantly leads to maximum output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Everyone has the same number of hours in a day, meaning "hardest working" quickly becomes a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

True output is a function of both the volume of activity and the [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] of that activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While initial effort is necessary to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, measuring success by the number of activities performed is a "newbie measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Seasoned professionals like Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos don't focus on activity metrics like sending thousands of emails or waking up at 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The focus should be on inputs with the most [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] to create the most output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Once maximum work capacity is reached, the only remaining lever for growth is increasing the [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This means changing *what* is worked on, not just working more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

In business growth, this involves analyzing calendars and organizational charts to identify low-[[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] activities that can be delegated or hired for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Business as a Team Sport: The Need for Diverse Roles

The notion of "no one can outwork me" is problematic because there are many ways to win in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Just like a "war party" in a video game or a football team, a successful business needs individuals with complementary skills, not just many people doing the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. A team with an "All-Star" but a poor supporting cast often loses to a better overall team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Many entrepreneurs mistakenly try to play the game as the sole star player, aiming to score all the points themselves, but ultimately lose to well-rounded teams like Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Success requires understanding the different roles within a business and how they fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Key functions within a business include:
*   **Promoters/Marketers:** Responsible for making products or services known, telling stories, building a [[personal_branding_and_its_impact_on_business_success | brand]], and providing value to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Salespeople:** Convert attention into direct sales, whether through ads, sales pages, videos, or person-to-person interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. These skills also extend to training and leading sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Product Specialists:** Focus on creating beautiful and effective products, understanding user experience (UX) and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The founder of Shopify, for example, excelled as a product person, not necessarily a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience/Success Managers:** Oversee how customers engage with the business, provide value, ensure amazing experiences, and help customers hit their milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

As an enterprise grows, skills become more specialized, requiring deeper expertise in each area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Bragging about "outworking" others misses the point; it should be about out-recruiting, out-managing, building superior culture, and excelling in [[leadership_and_management_in_business | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## The Evolution of the Entrepreneur: From Player to Coach

An entrepreneur's journey often involves evolving from a specialist into a coach.

### Level 1: The Specialist Player
Initially, an entrepreneur might excel at a specific function, becoming an expert in marketing, sales, or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This leads to roles like Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Chief Sales Officer, or Chief Product Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Level 2: The Coach
The ultimate role for an entrepreneur is to become the coach of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This means organizing the pieces and ensuring they play well together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Top coaches actively engage in [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | headhunting]] and [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | recruiting]] the best talent, whether from colleges or other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Companies like Google dedicate significant resources to attracting top talent at all levels, from entry-level to executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The parallels between sports and business in terms of [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | recruiting]] and team composition are almost identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If each "player" represents a function or department, the analogy scales to large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## The Significance of Effective Leadership and Coaching

As entrepreneurs ascend, playing the right game and measuring success with the right metrics becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The coach's role involves [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | recruiting]] top-level executives and establishing a "farm system" to cultivate talent, ensuring a sustained competitive advantage and potentially creating a business "dynasty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Effective [[leadership_and_management_in_business | leadership]] also entails the "soft skills" of creating a high-performance culture that maximizes the output of each individual player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The true value of a coach or CEO lies in the difference between what players would achieve without [[leadership_and_management_in_business | leadership]] versus what they achieve with exceptional [[leadership_and_management_in_business | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The CEO must aim for the highest [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | return on time]] within the organization, constantly solving the next big problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. By replacing low-[[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] activities with high-[[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] ones that strategically build the business, a CEO can transform entire organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This ability to set standards and embody core values across an organization is a CEO's greatest [[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

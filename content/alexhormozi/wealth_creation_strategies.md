The speaker's understanding of [[fundamentals_of_wealth_creation | wealth creation]] fundamentally shifted after observing that many wealthy individuals on the Forbes list resided in high-tax states like California, which initially seemed counterintuitive [00:00:00]. This led to a deeper understanding of what the speaker terms "wealth out" [00:00:07]. This approach is a key [[strategies_for_becoming_a_millionaire | strategy for becoming a millionaire]] and a valuable [[personal_finance_strategies | personal finance strategy]].

## The "Wealth Out" Concept

The "wealth out" strategy addresses how to minimize tax liability while significantly increasing net worth [00:00:07].

Consider a scenario where an individual earns $3 million, and a 50% tax rate reduces the take-home amount to $1.5 million [00:00:17]. This typically leads to frustration over the government taking half of the earnings [00:00:25].

However, instead of taking the cash, if $120 million is reinvested into the business, the personal net worth can increase by $120 million [00:00:31]. When combining this $120 million increase in net worth with the original $3 million cash flow, and only paying $1.5 million in taxes on the cash flow, the effective tax rate on the total $123 million becomes approximately 1.5% [00:00:42].

> As long as wealth is continuously built within the business and not cashed out, the growth remains tax-free and compounds [00:00:54].

This realization fundamentally changed how the speaker approached [[building_and_maintaining_wealth | building and maintaining wealth]] [00:01:01].

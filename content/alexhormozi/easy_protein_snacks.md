Achieving fitness goals in 2024 often requires a significant intake of protein, and several "zero-prep" or minimal-prep options exist to help meet these needs without extensive cooking or high calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These options are designed to be convenient, high in protein, and low in other macronutrients like carbs and fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Quick Protein Options for Any Time

Many of these protein-packed choices are versatile enough to be considered snacks, even if they are described as meals. They prioritize ease of preparation and high protein content.

### High-Protein Yogurt Bomb
This "protein bomb" offers a significant protein boost with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Ingredients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:
    *   Fage 0% yogurt (or similar brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   Crystal Light fruit punch (or Berry/Berry Sangria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
    *   Fruity Pebbles (or other preferred cereal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:
    1.  Add about half a packet of Crystal Light (meant for a pitcher) to the yogurt container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    2.  Mix thoroughly in the container or a larger bowl if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    3.  Sprinkle Fruity Pebbles on top in layers to maintain crunchiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Macros & Notes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
    *   The whole yogurt contains 94g of protein and just under 500 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   A cup of Fruity Pebbles adds 140 calories and 30g of carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For dieting, a half cup (70 calories, 15g carbs) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Yogurt is often easier to digest than pure milk for those with dairy sensitivities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   This breakfast can be very filling, contains almost 100g of protein, and requires no dish washing if eaten directly from the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Jerky and String Cheese
These are highly portable and convenient protein sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Original Jerky** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>:
    *   A typical bag (6 servings) has 60g of protein and less than 500 calories (around 480 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Light String Cheese** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>:
    *   Four string cheeses equal 200 calories and 24g of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, with minimal carbs and about 2.5g of fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   String cheeses are small, with about "two bites" per stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Combined Snack** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>:
    *   A combination of four string cheeses and a bag of jerky provides 84g of protein and roughly 680 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   They pair well together, providing a "meat and cheese" flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Cooked Shrimp with Cocktail Sauce
A lean and filling option for a quick protein boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

    2.  Dip shrimp into cocktail sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Macros & Notes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>:
    *   Shrimp itself has zero carbs and zero fat; it is pure protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
    *   Cocktail sauce typically has 30 calories per quarter cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   Shrimp is easily digestible for most people and is very filling due to its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

    *   Hershey's Zero Sugar syrup has 5 calories per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

    *   Alternatively, egg whites can be microwaved for 90 seconds to create a souffl√©-like texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, which can be topped with salsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## General Tips for Protein Consumption

*   **Zero-Prep Convenience:** Focus on foods that require minimal to no cooking or complex assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Protein:** Aim for foods that are primarily protein, with very little fat or carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Calorie-Conscious Flavoring:** Use low-calorie flavor enhancers like Crystal Light, zero-sugar syrups, hot sauces, or mustard to make high-protein foods delicious without adding significant calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Portion Control:** Even with "zero-prep" meals, be mindful of portions, especially if using ingredients with higher calorie counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Experiment with Textures:** For cereals or similar toppings, adding them in layers can help maintain crunchiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Maintain Variety (or not):** Sticking to the same meals for long periods can be effective for [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies|dieting and nutrition strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

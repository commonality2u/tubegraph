This article provides a tactical approach to time management and productivity, specifically for business owners and high-level employees, emphasizing that effective work goes beyond mere effort or time spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The core premise is that true productivity comes from focusing on high-leverage activities and eliminating non-essential tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Defining Work and Output

Traditional definitions of work (force x distance, time on clock, or effort) are not useful for knowledge workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The speaker proposes a definition where work is fundamentally about outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

*   **Work = Outputs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Outputs = Volume × Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    *   **Volume** is the number of times you do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Leverage** is how much you get out of each time you do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   To work faster or do more work per unit of time, the formula is: **(Volume × Leverage) / Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, which translates to output per unit of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Many people claim to work hard, but the speaker observes that most do not engage in activities that genuinely grow their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

> "The reason this is so important defining work is that all of us claim to work every day and yet most of us can't even Define the word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

## Identifying Business Growth Inputs

To grow a business, there are two fundamental paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:
1.  **Get more customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
    *   Increase traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> (e.g., advertise more/better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>)
    *   Convert a higher percentage of traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> (e.g., practice sales, improve offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>)
2.  **Make existing customers worth more** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    *   Raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
    *   Decrease cost of goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
    *   Get people to buy more stuff more times (e.g., decrease churn through reach-outs, exit interviews, improved onboarding, events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

For most smaller businesses, the primary focus should be disproportionately on getting more traffic and improving conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. If you don't have customers, you can't raise prices or increase lifetime value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## The Problem with "Busy Work"

Much of the time spent "working" by business owners has the same impact as doing nothing if it doesn't align with these core growth activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This leads to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Prioritizing Your Time

[[prioritizing_tasks_for_business_success | Prioritizing tasks]] is crucial. Some problems are not "the problem" of the business today and can be neglected for a season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Once a skill is gained, it takes less time to maintain it, freeing up time for other growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Example: If you master traffic generation but struggle with sales conversion, conversion becomes the new limiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. You should then train someone else on advertising and dedicate four hours a day to optimizing conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Activities for improving conversion could include:
*   Tracking close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
*   Recording sales interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   Watching "game tape" of successful sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Practicing sales scripts daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   Hiring a sales coach for daily feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Mental prep before consults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   Using pre-sale questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Better phone qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

## Strategies for Time Management

All skills are attainable through repetition and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Once proficient, you gain [[understanding_productivity_through_time_investment | leverage]], doing more in less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Finding Time: Maker Time vs. Manager Time

Entrepreneurs have two primary types of work periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>:

*   **Maker Time**: Long, uninterrupted blocks (4-6 hours) dedicated to low-urgency, high-importance work that moves the business forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Interruptions destroy these blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. A productive maker calendar is an empty calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Manager Time**: Smaller blocks (5-15 minutes) for managing teams, coordination, communication, and putting out fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The goal is to fill the calendar with these slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

It is crucial to understand and explain to your team the difference between these work styles and their importance to the business's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Mixing manager tasks into maker time is inefficient and unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | Maker Habits]]

To facilitate maker time, the speaker suggests:
*   Decide on one most important project to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   Work early in the morning (e.g., 4 AM to 9 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Turn off all notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Create a distraction-free environment (dark room, no sound, earplugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   Understand that there are almost no true business emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   Consider working on weekends for uninterrupted blocks (104 days a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Buying Time: Elimination for Greater Productivity

[[personal_experience_with_productivity | Personal experience with productivity]] shows that productivity increases more through elimination of non-essential tasks than by optimizing how you do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This is about acknowledging you have "one battery" and eliminating drains not aligned with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Categorizing common time-consuming activities and their replacement costs:
*   **Food (groceries, prepping, eating, cleaning):** 50 hours/month; replacement cost ~\$800/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Home Cleaning:** 25 hours/month; replacement cost ~\$500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Laundry:** 16 hours/month; replacement cost ~\$200/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

These three activities combined can free up 96 hours per month (two full work weeks) for approximately \$1,500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. If your time is worth more than \$15/hour, this trade-off is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This is a form of reinvesting in yourself, but the time gained *must* be used for high-value work, not leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

Further time-wasters that cost nothing to eliminate:
*   Following sports teams: 4 hours/week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>
*   Watching TV: 21 hours/week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>
*   Scrolling social media: 17 hours/week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>

Commuting can also be bought back by using services like Uber, freeing up time for productive work during transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## The Unfair Advantage

By systematically identifying core growth activities, dedicating specific time blocks ([[balancing_maker_and_manager_time | balancing maker and manager time]]), and eliminating low-value tasks by "buying back" time, a business leader can achieve significantly higher output than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. An individual dedicating 96 productive hours a week can move 30 times faster than someone only getting 3 productive hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This approach allows leaders to fulfill their managerial duties while also performing the high-leverage "maker" work essential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. The secret to accelerating growth is not a hack, but the diligent elimination of energy drains not aligned with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

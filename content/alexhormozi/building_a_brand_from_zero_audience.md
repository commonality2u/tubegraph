Building a brand from scratch, particularly without an existing audience, requires a significant long-term commitment and a shift in mindset from focusing on immediate outcomes to consistently executing necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The Journey to Brand Growth
Many individuals start ventures like podcasts with the expectation of rapid success within 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the reality is that [[Building a brand without gimmicks or sensationalism | significant brand growth]] often takes years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For instance, one podcast took five and a half to six years to reach the top 10 charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Just Start
A common discouragement when starting is the lack of an existing following or audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite this, the primary advice is simply to "just start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Focus on Consistent Action
Instead of measuring success by outcomes, shift your focus to the daily activities you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
This means:
*   **Creating content:** Regularly producing valuable material, rather than regurgitating others' ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Making "reach outs":** Engaging with your audience and potential customers consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For six years, the speaker committed to releasing one to three podcasts every single week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A friend who successfully grew an online presence posted every day for six months before his videos started gaining significant traction and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Evolution of Voice and Content
The initial year of [[Branding and audience engagement | building a brand]] often involves finding your unique voice and refining your communication style, learning how to teach, entertain, and present information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Initially, content may be niche. For example, the first 150 episodes of a podcast focused solely on how to run a gym better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Over time, the subject matter broadened to include general marketing, sales, and broader business topics, evolving as the creator's knowledge and interests expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Both the subject matter and the skill in delivery improved over this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Decades, Not Days
Thinking in terms of decades rather than days when setting goals is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A commitment to a decade-long plan for a YouTube channel, for instance, sets a sustainable pace and avoids the trap of seeking immediate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This long-term perspective allows for continuous progress without being swayed by short-term ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### The Problem with Outcome-Based Goals
Measuring yourself by external goals, such as a specific sales target or amount of money earned, can lead to inconsistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. When a desired outcome is achieved, people often slow down or stop their activities, leading to a "scarcity mode" when results decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

This indicates a lack of consistency, which is a key trait for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The ability to keep doing the work, irrespective of immediate results—whether things are going extremely well or not yet—is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This shift in focus from the outcome to the activities themselves allows for sustained effort and stable self-esteem, as you are committed to what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

According to *Atomic Habits*, both winners and losers often share the same goals; what differentiates them is that winners commit to the activities, while losers commit to the goal itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### The Power of 400 Pieces of Content
Creating a substantial volume of content, such as 400 long-form pieces, is highly likely to result in a larger following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The question of "how long will that take?" should be answered with "as long as it takes," reinforcing that the goal is the consistent action, not the immediate outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

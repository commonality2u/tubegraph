## Beyond the "Hard Work" Mantra

The idea that hard work alone leads to wealth is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many individuals are outworked by others yet still earn more money, indicating that there is something beyond sheer effort at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The mantra "no one can outwork me" is objectively false, as countless people outwork and have outworked others, and it doesn't ultimately matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While putting in volume of activity is essential for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, bragging about work has little to do with achieving the highest levels of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For instance, Warren Buffett states that if he makes two good decisions a year, he considers it a good year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He spends five or six hours a day reading, eats McDonald's, and makes a couple of good decisions annually, yet he earns significantly more than those who boast about working extremely hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Everyone has the same number of hours in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, and maximizing hours worked only results in a tie for "hardest working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Leverage as the Key to Output

Output is created by combining the volume of activity with the leverage of the activity being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While some initial energy input is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, measuring success by the number of activities performed is a "newbie" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Highly successful individuals like Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos do not focus on activity metrics like sending a thousand emails or waking up at 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. What truly matters are the inputs that have the most leverage to generate the greatest output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Once an individual reaches their capacity for work, the next step is to maximize the leverage of their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For a CEO at acquisition.com, the focus shifts from working more hours (which is often impossible) to changing *what* they work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This involves analyzing calendars and organizational charts to identify low-leverage activities that can be delegated to others or to new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## The Entrepreneur as the Team's Coach

There are many ways to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When forming a "war party" to achieve a goal, it's crucial to assemble individuals with [[importance_of_skill_development | complementary skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. For example, a team needs a healer, a mage for damage, and a paladin for defense, not just ten paladins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Similarly, in football, a team wouldn't consist of only running backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The entrepreneur's primary role should be that of the [[the_significance_of_leadership_and_coaching_in_business | coach]] of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Success depends on [[building_and_retaining_a_team | organizing the pieces]] and how well they play together, rather than individual heroics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Often, teams with an "All-Star" but a poor supporting cast are defeated by a better overall team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Many entrepreneurs try to be the star player, scoring all the points, but ultimately lose to well-rounded organizations like Apple, which operates as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Specialized Roles in Business

To win, it's more valuable to understand the various roles within a business and how individuals' characteristics and skill sets map to those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. These roles include:

*   **Promoters/Marketers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>: Understand how to make things known across platforms, tell stories, build brands, and [[the_importance_of_providing_value | provide value]] to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Salespeople** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>: Convert attention into sales through direct response ads, sales pages, videos, or direct human-to-human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. In the long term, they train and lead others in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Product Creators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>: Focus on making something beautiful and effective, like the founder of Shopify, who excelled at product but wasn't necessarily the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience/Success Managers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>: Manage how customers engage, provide value, ensure an amazing experience, and help customers hit milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

These roles are distinct, and individuals who are brilliant marketers may struggle with sales, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. As an enterprise grows, skills become more specialized, and a deeper well of experience is required for each role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Recruiting and Developing High-Performing Teams

The focus should shift from "no one can outwork me" to "no one can out-recruit me" or "no one can out-manage me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Building a unique culture that fosters high performance and leads effectively is a highly leveraged activity across an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Coaches of top sports teams constantly headhunt and [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | recruit]] the best players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Companies like Google invest heavily in [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | recruiting]] the best and brightest from universities and business schools, as well as top-level executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The parallels between sports and business in this regard are striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Moving up the levels of entrepreneurship means playing the right game and using the correct metrics for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Being the [[the_significance_of_leadership_and_coaching_in_business | coach]] involves:

*   [[importance_of_talent_and_hiring_in_business | Recruiting]] top-level executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Creating a "farm system" to feed talent into the company for a sustained competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Developing the "soft skills" of creating a [[strategies_for_developing_highperforming_teams | high-performance culture]] to maximize output from every individual player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The value of a coach or CEO is measured by the difference in player performance between having no coach and having the best coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The CEO must achieve the highest return on time within the organization, constantly solving the next problem and ensuring new activities build the business even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. A CEO's ability to turn around large businesses in a few years, based on the standards and values they set, demonstrates the immense leverage they can create across the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

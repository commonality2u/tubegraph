This article explores various strategies for new businesses to save costs and implement effective marketing, drawing insights from the frozen yogurt industry. These principles are applicable across different business types.

## Frozen Yogurt Business Model: A Case Study

Frozen yogurt stores can serve as a valuable case study for understanding business dynamics, particularly in a commoditized market. On average, frozen yogurt stores make between $750,000 and $800,000 a year in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. An average store doing over $2,000 a day can yield approximately $328 a day in owner pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Profit margins typically range from 10% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, with an average Menchie's owner taking home around $93,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Despite seemingly high revenue, challenges include perishable goods (strawberries going bad), machine maintenance, and high costs for prominent retail leases with good signage, foot traffic, and parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Franchise Considerations
Franchises often take around 6% of top-line revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, which can represent 60% of an operator's 10% margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Franchises structure fees to ensure franchisees make just enough to continue operating, possibly opening more locations, but not enough to get rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Their goal is to significantly beat the stock market's return on capital, aiming for 20-25% when the stock market yields 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

While franchises offer potential savings on bulk purchasing due to their large scale (e.g., for yogurt, fruit, spoons, cups, machines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, they might upcharge on initial setup costs and supplies to generate their own profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Market Competition and Opportunity
The frozen yogurt market is largely commoditized, with little perceived difference between major brands like Menchie's, Yogurtland, and Golden Spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This indicates a poorly competed market, primarily driven by franchisors focused on selling locations rather than building strong brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. There is no dominant "Chick-fil-A" of the yogurt world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, suggesting significant opportunity for a business to outperform competitors through superior operations and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Many existing stores exhibit poor operational standards, such as sticky floors, messy areas, and disengaged staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Cost-Saving Strategies for New Businesses

When starting a new business, especially if it's not entirely novel, there's often an opportunity to acquire assets from failed businesses.

*   **Buying Foreclosed Assets:** Utilize business foreclosure sites like Rasmus.com to purchase equipment for a fraction of its original cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. For example, gym equipment was purchased for $13,000 from such a site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, and frozen yogurt store contents have been found for as low as $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This can dramatically decrease startup costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Franchise Upcharges:** Franchises often prevent owners from buying equipment independently, as they make money by upcharging on initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Strategic Product Costing:** For frozen yogurt, toppings are more expensive (10-40 cents per ounce) than yogurt (8 cents per ounce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Stores make profit primarily from yogurt, charging 50-60 cents per ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Understanding the margin differences between product components is crucial for [[strategies_for_maximizing_business_profits | maximizing profits]].

## Pricing and Sales Psychology

Psychological principles can be leveraged to encourage higher spending and improve customer perception. These principles contribute to [[entrepreneurship_and_selling_strategies | entrepreneurial success]].

1.  **Pricing by Usage/Weight:** Allow customers to control how much they spend by pricing based on usage or weight (e.g., frozen yogurt by the ounce instead of by cup size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This shifts accountability for overspending to the customer, making them less likely to blame the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Power of the Default Option:** Remove smaller options to encourage customers to choose larger quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For example, frozen yogurt stores often only offer medium and large cups, leading people to fill more, as a small amount in a bucket-sized cup looks odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
3.  **Presenting Items in Reverse Order of Cost:** Arrange self-serve items so the highest-margin items are presented first, and the lowest-margin/highest-cost items are last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This is similar to buffets placing salad first and seafood last to encourage filling up on cheaper items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For yogurt, the highest margin yogurt comes first, then dry toppings, then fresh fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
4.  **Offer More Selection:** The more options provided for sampling or selection, the more customers will ultimately buy and consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Effective Marketing and Customer Acquisition Strategies

For businesses with low average ticket values and slim margins, traditional paid advertising can be unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

*   **Word-of-Mouth and Referrals:** These are the most profitable customer acquisition strategies for low-cost products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Encourage Sharing:** Actively ask customers for reviews and to share the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Simply asking can significantly increase engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   **Affiliate Partnerships:** Collaborate with other businesses to send referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Operational Excellence:** Corporate analysis found that the highest-performing stores had better service, cleaner environments, and more selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. These factors contribute significantly to word-of-mouth.
*   **Community Engagement & Promotions:**
    *   **Targeted Outreach:** Go to places with large groups of people (e.g., universities, companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   **Competitions and Incentives:** Run competitions (e.g., between fraternities/sororities) to drive demand and offer swag or prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This is a cheap form of advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> and a key component of [[strategies_for_business_growth_through_advertising_and_sales | advertising and sales growth]].
*   **Lead Capture & Lifetime Value:** Offer strong incentives (e.g., 50% off) to get customer contact information (like a text number) to build a lead list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This allows for ongoing communication and reminders, maximizing lifetime value for a low acquisition cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

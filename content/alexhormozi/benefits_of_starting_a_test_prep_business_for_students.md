Starting a test prep and/or tutoring business is presented as an excellent business opportunity for students, offering significant profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It's a venture that can generate $1,120 per day in profit, not just revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, and can be managed while still in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For those not in school, it requires only about four hours of work per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This business model was considered as a venture before starting a gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Focus on Outcome, Not Just Tutoring
The key to success in test prep is not selling tutoring directly, but rather selling the *outcome* of tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This outcome can include:
*   Securing a job that pays more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Passing a specific test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Passing standardized tests (e.g., SAT, GMAT), which are considered the most valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Improving scores on standardized tests can lead to admission into better colleges or business schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This materially impacts an individual's network, the companies that recruit from those institutions, and their average salary and [[earning_potential_with_a_tutoring_side_hustle | earning capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. College itself was an "original Biz op," promising higher earnings as a result of the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Semi-Private Tutoring Model
The most effective and profitable approach is the [[advantages_of_semiprivate_tutoring_models | semi-private model]], rather than one-on-one or unlimited "one-to-many" sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Why Semi-Private is Profitable
[[advantages_of_semiprivate_tutoring_models | Semi-private tutoring]] is one of the most profitable service models because you can charge two-thirds of the one-on-one rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, but work with eight times as many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A group of eight students is still considered a small group setting, allowing for personalized attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Students can take turns solving problems, making it more efficient than one-on-one teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Financial Comparison
*   **One-on-One Model:** If charging $60 per hour for one-on-one tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, four hours of work would yield $240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Semi-Private Model (1-on-8):** Charging $35 per student for a group of eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, you earn $280 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. For the same four hours of work, this model generates $1,120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, which is four and a half times more money per unit of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This business can potentially allow someone to earn more than a doctor without accumulating student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Operational Aspects
*   **Location:** This business can be conducted at free libraries, reducing overhead costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Customer Base:** To reach $1,120 per day, you would need around 50 students paying $35 per session, three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The $35 price point is generally affordable and justified by the potential for students to earn $100,000 more per year by attending better schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Pricing & Packaging:** It's preferable to get students to prepay to avoid transactional, one-off arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The selling pitch should focus on the *goal* (e.g., increasing test score) and the number of problems needed to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Curriculum Structure:** A three-day curriculum model is suggested: Class A, Class B, and a makeup day (students still pay for the makeup day to avoid falling behind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** The business can be run for only four hours a day, allowing for a full-time job or other activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Predictable Results
Test prep is highly repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Research indicates that test scores on exams like the SAT and GMAT are directly proportional to the number of problems solved before taking the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This provides a clear input-output equation: more problems solved equals better scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Getting Started: Acquiring Customers
This business requires no capital, rental space, or build-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Initial Outreach
1.  **Leverage Your Network:** Contact people you know and actively [[acquiring_customers_for_small_businesses | DM]] individuals in your high school network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Share your own success story (e.g., score improvement from X to Y) and explain your method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
2.  **Contact Parents and Adults:** Don't be afraid to reach out to parents and adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Overcome shame and ask many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
3.  **[[benefits_of_offering_free_services_initially | Offer Free Sessions]]:** Provide a free session to demonstrate your method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This acts as a half-assessment leading into a sales pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Show an "easy win" early on to demonstrate improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   For the first 5-10 free sessions, ensure students commit to homework. Implement a billing system if homework isn't done, creating "skin in the game" for them and motivating them to achieve better scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
4.  **The "Big Three" Post-Session:** After free sessions, ask for:
    *   Feedback on improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   A testimonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   A referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
5.  **Leverage Testimonials:** Post testimonials online and invite interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. [[acquiring_customers_for_small_businesses | DM]] anyone who engages with special offers (e.g., half off for the next 10 clients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These "soft hooks" can drive DMs and allow for upsells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
6.  **Broader Outreach:**
    *   Reach out to people you don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   Consider running ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   Go to sports teams; many athletes need to achieve a certain score for scholarships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This can lead to quick word-of-mouth spread within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook
It may take about six months to build up a student base to reach $1,000 to $1,100 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This path allows individuals to achieve top one percent earnings with no capital risk, time loss, or debt, unlike traditional college pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Scaling to "Super Saiyan" Mode
To achieve "Super Saiyan" levels of income, the business owner can outsource the tutoring itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Delegation and Profit
*   **Focus on Acquisition:** The owner focuses on getting students to sign up and systematizing the process for increasing scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Hire Teachers:** Hire teachers at a rate like $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This creates a significant spread between the $280/hour generated per group and the teacher's pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Many teachers are willing to work for this rate, which can be more than their regular jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Aim for service-based margins of 80% or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Reinvest Time:** The four hours previously spent tutoring can now be used for promotion, marketing, selling, and finding more teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Building Pipelines
*   **Student Pipeline:** Develop a robust system for attracting and enrolling students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Teacher Pipeline:** Ask existing teachers for referrals of other qualified teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can create a waiting list of teachers eager to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Million-Dollar Earning Potential
By employing multiple teachers (e.g., four teachers), each paid $50 per hour while generating $280 per hour, the owner can make approximately $1,100 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. With four teachers working for four hours, the total revenue is $4,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. After paying each teacher $200 (4 hours x $50/hour), total costs are $800, leaving a profit of $3,600 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This daily profit exceeds the $3,300 needed to earn a million dollars a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, placing the owner above the top one percent of earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This is achievable with just four part-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

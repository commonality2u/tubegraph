Achieving a significant net worth, such as $100 million by age 31, often involves learning from past mistakes and adopting specific principles that challenge common beliefs about money and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These principles emphasize a focus on return on time, strategic saving, long-term vision, continuous learning, and prioritizing genuine value over superficial status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Debunking "Passive Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
The concept of "passive income" is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. All money is made over time, meaning everyone has a "dollars per hour" rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Instead of distinguishing between passive and active income, it's more useful to consider the "return on time" or how much you make per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Many people fear the idea of trading hours for money, but everyone does, even if the compensation isn't explicitly denominated in hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

An obsession with quick, easy, low-effort money can lead to spending heavily on things that promise no time investment, while neglecting activities that actively generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Rather than seeking passive opportunities, focus on investing money back into active income streams that are already proving successful to multiply their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Calculating Your Hourly Rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
To gain perspective on your earnings, divide your total income from the last year by 2,000 (for a 40-hour work week) or approximately 8,000 (for actual hours of being alive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This calculation helps determine if a potential activity is "worth your time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The "Buy It Twice" Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
A critical rule for managing money is: if you can't buy something twice (or even three, four, or five times over), don't buy it once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This rule encourages you to consider the amount of time it takes to earn the post-tax money for a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For example, spending 2 hours of a 6-hour shift on lunch reveals the true cost of daily habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Feeling the "pain" associated with the time investment before a purchase can drastically shift buying behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Saving money, while not directly making money, provides capital to take on bigger, wealth-generating risks in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Power of a Decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
Many people overestimate what they can achieve in a year but underestimate what they can achieve in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Significant [[building_and_maintaining_wealth | wealth building]] and life-changing results are possible over a 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The key is to commit to a long-term contract with yourself, focusing on compounding potential earnings rather than chasing immediate, smaller gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

This mindset encourages investing in personal growth and skill development, even if it means foregoing higher immediate income for an internship or opportunity that offers exponential growth over a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The asset to invest in is yourself, using time and effort to gain experience and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In the early stages, when funds are limited, prioritize investing in yourself over traditional investments like the S&P 500, as your personal growth will always outperform the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Principles of Wealth Creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

### Only Get Rich Once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
Do not bet what you possess and need for something you don't possess and don't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This includes being cautious about partnerships, which can often be the riskiest endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A partner must bring clear contributions that you lack, such as money, experience, or time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Time Management is Money Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
Money is an encapsulated version of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The wealthiest individuals are those who have learned to best invest their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Regularly appraise your calendar to identify opportunities to trade time for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Be aware of the transaction cost of your time, even for leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Consistently trading up the value of your time will increase your income year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Check Your Bank Account Before Social Media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>
This habit fosters financial awareness. If checking your bank account causes discomfort, it's even more crucial to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. As Peter Drucker noted, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Awareness of a problem—whether financial or related to other goals like weight loss—prompts conscious or subconscious actions toward improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This consistent monitoring builds discipline and enables delayed gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Learn to Make Money Before Making Money Make Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>
Many young people try to invest small amounts of money, hoping for high returns, often leading to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Instead, focus on actively improving your skills and actions to increase your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Investing in your skills to increase your annual earning by 50% will yield far greater returns than chasing a 10% or 20% return on a small initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### The Myth of "No Time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
Claiming "you don't have time" is often a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Even with a full-time job or as a student, most people have significant hours between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. to dedicate to personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Reframing current comfort as a future discomfort can motivate trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Embracing discomfort today can lead to comfort for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Work has a double effect: you make money, and you're not spending money while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Patience in investing means finding productive activities to do in the meantime, primarily working to have more money to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Understanding Risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>
If you don't understand how you can lose money in an endeavor, you *will* lose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Optimism is essential for entrepreneurship, but it must be tempered with a realistic understanding of potential downsides and their likelihood, multiplied by a conservative factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### The Cost of Ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>
The biggest cost is ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The difference between your current reality and your financial goals represents the cost of not knowing how to achieve those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Prioritizing the payment of "ignorance debt" through any available currency (relational capital, favors, or money) is crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Investing in learning, even at a high cost, can be a bet on oneself that cannot be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Lessons learned from education, even unexpected ones, invariably provide more value than their cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. When providing "free" help or favors, do it completely and professionally, treating it as a paid service to build reciprocity and a network of valuable contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Bartering skills is highly efficient and avoids [[tax_implications_on_wealth | tax implications on wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

### Two Types of Knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>
To effectively pay down ignorance, understand two types of knowledge:
1.  **Declarative knowledge**: Learning *about* something that exists which you didn't know existed (e.g., private equity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. This often reveals "unknown unknowns" and provides breakthroughs by showing how wealthier individuals perceive the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
2.  **Procedural knowledge**: Learning *how* to do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This is more predictable, as you're learning specific steps for a skill you already know exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

When investing in access to networks or relationships, the primary gain is often declarative knowledge—discovering new strategies, business models, or [[tax_implications_on_wealth | tax strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. When seeking procedural knowledge, employ a "document, demonstrate, duplicate" approach to truly master the skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Status vs. Wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>
Material possessions like watches or luxury cars are often sought for short-term status, but this comes at the expense of long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. You cannot impress someone wealthier than you with assets; you will only impress those below you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. To impress poor people, you outspend them; to impress rich people, you outwork them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. True respect from successful individuals comes from recognizing a shared commitment to hard work and dedication, not superficial displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This is a common pitfall of [[underspending_on_education_and_overspending_on_status | underspending on education and overspending on status]].

### Buy Time Like a Rich Person, Buy Stuff Like a Poor Person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>
Prioritize buying back your low-cost time (e.g., for chores like cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking) to free up more time for high-income-earning activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This allows you to leverage your most valuable asset (time) to make more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

This strategy leads to a double benefit: you make more money by working more high-value hours, and you become more skilled faster due to increased practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

## Reference Groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>
Who you compare yourself to, not who you spend most of your time with, is the highest predictor of your earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Motivation often stems from lacking something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. To be motivated to make money, cultivate a desire to make *a lot* more money by observing those who are doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

Your "reference group" consists of the people whose opinions you value when making big decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. If those people don't have what you want, disregard their advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Only listen to opinions from those whose dreams for you are bigger than your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

## Investing and Spending Habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>
The mindset of "there will always be time to make money later" is the fundamental crux of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Prioritize investing first, then spend what is left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

### Automate Investing, Create Friction for Spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>
Automate money transfers from your paycheck into investment accounts before you see it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. For spending, manualize withdrawals (e.g., writing checks, paying cash) to increase awareness of money leaving your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. Make it difficult to spend money (e.g., deleting shopping apps, not saving credit card details online) and easy to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. As you earn more, keep your living expenses fixed rather than increasing proportionally, so more money goes into investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Thinking Bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>
It is often easier to make a million dollars than $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. The $100,000 goal often assumes a traditional time-for-money exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. However, a goal of a million or $10 million forces a shift in strategy, requiring different tools and a focus on acquiring skills needed for large-scale impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

## The Nature of Money and Wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>
Do not love money; learn to love *making* money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. The misconception that "money is the root of all evil" is often misquoted; the original text states "the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This means an excessive desire for money can lead to unethical or immoral actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

Money itself is neutral, merely "potential energy" or "bottled time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. It can be used for destruction or for building hospitals, schools, and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Fearing money means fearing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. If your mission is to help the world, making more money amplifies your ability to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

### Making Others Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>
Your earning potential depends on three variables:
1.  The total value you create for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
2.  Your ability to negotiate how much of that value you retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
3.  The scarcity of others who can create that same value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

To maximize earnings, create value in a way that is unique and difficult for others to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This uniqueness comes from a "skill stack"—a combination of diverse skills and experiences gained over your unique life journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. Your lived experiences and the time you invest become your competitive advantage and a moat against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## Final Principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>
*   Money loves speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
*   Wealth loves time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   Poverty loves indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

Many entrepreneurs often adopt "weird shticks" related to food, exercise, hydration, biohacking, and even specific accessories like orange glasses or finger toe shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, from the perspective of someone who came from the [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | fitness world]], much of this is considered "complete make believe" and a "complete farce" primarily designed to sell products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The speaker, who has maintained a six-pack since his early teens while eating ice cream daily, advocates for a different, more sustainable approach to fitness and nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This method, which has been followed for nearly 20 years, allows for the consumption of desired foods like cookies, ice cream, and alcohol without compromising physical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Understanding Your Body Type and Goals

The first step in any fitness journey is to understand your current body type and what you aspire to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Body types can be categorized on a matrix based on fat and muscle levels:
*   **High fat, low muscle:** Often results in a feminine figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Low muscle, low fat:** Appears "skin and bones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **High fat, high muscle:** Described as generally "big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Low fat, high muscle:** Characteristic of a [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | bodybuilder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Once you identify your starting point and desired outcome (e.g., going from skinny to big), you can determine the necessary directional changes in your [[caloriefocused_dietary_strategies | calorie intake]] and [[bodybuilding_techniques_and_workout_strategies | workout volume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To gain weight, for instance, you need to increase your calories and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Demystifying Diets: It's All About Calories

A major misconception is that various [[dieting_and_nutrition_strategies | dieting and nutrition strategies]] are fundamentally different. The speaker argues that all popular diets achieve weight loss for the same reason: they reduce overall calorie intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Normal Balanced Meal:** Contains an even distribution of protein, carbohydrates, and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Keto Diet:** Eliminates carbohydrates, resulting in roughly one-third fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Low-Fat Diet:** Eliminates fat, also leading to approximately one-third fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Portion Control Diet:** Reduces the total amount of all three macronutrients, thus consuming fewer calories overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Reduces the number of meals per day (e.g., from three to two), resulting in fewer total calories ingested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the specific type of diet doesn't matter; the underlying mechanism for weight loss is always calorie reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Diets fail when individuals compensate for eliminated macronutrients by overconsuming other high-calorie foods, negating the calorie deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. No one is immune to a calorie deficit; if you eat nothing long enough, you will lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## The Simple 3-Step Flexible Eating Strategy

For 99% of people, only three things are essential for controlling how they look and eat: daily calorie intake, daily protein intake, and workout volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The speaker focuses on the first two:

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Needs

Your daily calorie target is determined by your body weight multiplied by a "goal number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This goal number varies based on your objective:
*   **Maintain weight:** Body weight x 13-15 (e.g., 200 lbs x 15 = 3000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Fast weight loss:** Body weight x 10 (e.g., 200 lbs x 10 = 2000 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Extreme weight loss:** Body weight x 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Extreme weight gain:** Body weight x 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

If you aren't losing weight at your desired rate, you can simply decrease your calorie target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Calculate Daily Protein Needs

Aim for your body weight in grams of protein per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, a 200-pound individual needs 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

*   **Life Hack:** 100 grams of protein is approximately equivalent to one pound of lean meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   For 200 grams of protein, you would consume two pounds of lean meat daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Lean meat sources include shrimp, tilapia, tenderloin, flank steak, top round, top sirloin, and chicken breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

This protein intake forms the "cornerstone" of the diet, protecting muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining "Whatever You Want" Calories

1.  **Calculate calories from protein:** Multiply your daily protein grams by 5 (to account for a small amount of fat in lean meat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
    *   Example: 200 grams protein x 5 calories/gram = 1000 calories from protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
2.  **Subtract protein calories from total daily calories:**
    *   Example: 2200 total calories (from Step 1) - 1000 calories (from protein) = 1200 calories remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

These remaining calories are your "whatever the hell I want" calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. You can use them for treats like ice cream, cookies, Twizzlers, or anything else you desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Benefits of [[Flexible Dining for Entrepreneurs | Flexible Eating]]

This approach to [[maintaining_fitness_with_simple_nutrition | maintaining fitness with simple nutrition]] offers several key advantages:

*   **Sustainability:** It's designed to be a lifelong eating pattern, not a temporary "diet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **No "Falling Off":** Since nothing is forbidden, there's no concept of "cheating" or "falling off" a diet, eliminating the typical cycle of restriction and binging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Freedom and Enjoyment:** You can enjoy foods typically considered "bad" every day, making them less "special" and reducing cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This allows for [[balancing_dessert_and_fitness | balancing dessert and fitness]].
*   **Simplicity:** It avoids the complexities and "shenanigans" of [[common_misconceptions_about_diets | unconventional diet explanations]] and [[caloriefocused_dietary_strategies | biohacking]] prevalent in some entrepreneurial circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** You can distribute your meals however you prefer â€“ five meals a day, three meals, or even one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

This system allows you to achieve and maintain your desired physique while enjoying a flexible diet, proving that focusing on total calories and protein intake is more effective than restrictive and unsustainable dieting fads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

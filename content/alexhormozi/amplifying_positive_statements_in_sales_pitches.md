A powerful persuasion tactic, known as "damaging admission," involves acknowledging deficiencies or negatives upfront to significantly increase a prospect's [[sales_tactics_to_build_trust | trust]] and amplify positive statements. This method utilizes [[building_trust_in_sales_through_integrity | integrity]] by being more honest and authentic, helping the speaker stand out in sales environments often characterized by exaggerated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## The Role of Trust in Sales

The willingness of a prospect to buy is directly linked to the level of [[sales_tactics_to_build_trust | trust]] they have in the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. For instance, if a prospect genuinely believed they would receive ten dollars for every dollar spent, everyone would buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This principle is evident in referrals, where closing is easier because the referrer has already established a high degree of [[sales_tactics_to_build_trust | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The "Damaging Admission" Tactic

The core of this tactic, reportedly inspired by Eminem in "8 Mile," is the strategic use of the word "but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### How the Word "But" Functions

*   **Amplification:** Everything stated *after* the word "but" is amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Diminishment:** Conversely, everything stated *before* the word "but" is diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

By arranging a statement as "Negative statement, BUT positive statement," the "but" acts as an amplifier for the beneficial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This allows the speaker to control where the prospect's attention is directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Increasing Believability

The more truthful, negative, or "damaging" the admission made *before* the word "but," the more believable the subsequent positive statement becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This approach makes the overall argument more persuasive and credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Practical Examples

*   **Sales Pitch Reversal:**
    *   *Ineffective:* "You're going to make a ton of money if you work with me, but it's going to be a ton of work; you'll have to go through hundreds of hours of videos and spend five hours a day." (Attention is directed to the negative work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   *Effective:* "You're gonna have to go through hundreds of hours of videos, you're gonna have to take five hours a day... but you're gonna make more money than ever in your life." (Attention is directed to the positive financial gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Viagra Commercial:** A famous example involved the warning "If an erection lasts longer than four hours, you must contact a medical professional." This genuine risk amplified the perceived power of the product, making the positive outcome seem more believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Gym Launch Example:** Acknowledging one-star reviews ("Gym Launch has tons of one-star reviews") makes the subsequent claim of thousands of five-star reviews more credible, similar to how reviews function on platforms like Amazon or restaurant ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Tax Burden Warning:** "Warning, when you sign up and start working with Gym Launch, you're gonna massively increase your tax burden. We are not liable for the amount of taxes you're going to have to pay as a result of the amount of money we're gonna make." This frames a negative consequence as proof of overwhelming positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

By proactively owning all potential negatives or challenges, a seller can use these points to enhance the persuasiveness of their core argument and foster greater [[sales_tactics_to_build_trust | trust]] with prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

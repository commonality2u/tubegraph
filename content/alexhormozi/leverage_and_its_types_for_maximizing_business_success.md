While 99% of entrepreneurs never achieve over $10 million in annual sales, and 90% never hit $1 million, success leaves clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Reaching these higher tiers of business growth largely depends on two major categories: the entrepreneur's capabilities and the **opportunity vehicle** they pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The fundamental difference between what you put in and what you get out is known as [[the_role_of_leverage_in_business_success | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Understanding Leverage

[[leverage_as_a_key_to_making_money | Leverage]] is defined as the difference between the input you provide and the output you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. A skilled entrepreneur, possessing hundreds of smaller skills, naturally gains more leverage because their inputs yield greater outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### The Role of Skills and Beliefs

An entrepreneur's success is determined by their skills and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While "character traits" like patience are often seen as inherent, they are, in fact, trainable skills composed of many micro-skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Both "hard skills" (easy to measure) and "soft skills" (hard to measure) are 100% trainable and improvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

However, beliefs are equally critical. Limiting beliefs can significantly decrease an entrepreneur's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Many of these beliefs are "unknown unknowns" – things one doesn't even question because they seem like reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For example, a high-level CrossFit competitor didn't market his fitness app because he believed he didn't "deserve" one unless he was the winner, despite having an excellent product and the skills to market it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Changing this belief led to a fivefold increase in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Identifying Opportunity Vehicles

A common pitfall for entrepreneurs is being in the "wrong vehicle" despite having a high-level skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The speaker initially believed his path was owning gyms, aiming to be "America's next gym" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, a mentor pointed out that his skills were better suited to teaching others how to do what he did, a completely unknown opportunity at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This realization led to a shift from brick-and-mortar gyms to a done-for-you turnaround business, and then to a licensing model, each offering higher [[role_of_leverage_and_efficiency_in_scaling_a_business | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Similarly, a photography studio owner was encouraged to shift from an agency model to owning all the studios, which significantly increased revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This highlights that changing the "boat you're in" is often more impactful than how hard you row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Four Types of Leverage

Inspired by Naval Ravikant, the speaker identifies four key types of [[leverage_and_its_role_in_wealth_creation | leverage]]:

1.  **Collaboration**: Involves other people working for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This includes recruiting, onboarding, training, and managing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
2.  **Capital**: Utilizing other people's money to invest and generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This requires skills in finance, legal understanding, and negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
3.  **Code**: Building software that can be used by millions, created once but leveraged repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
4.  **Content**: Creating media (like a podcast episode) that can reach millions after being produced once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This requires understanding platforms, storytelling, and building credibility through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

It is not necessary to utilize all four types of leverage; maximizing even one can lead to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### A Personal Trajectory of Increasing Leverage

The speaker's career illustrates how different types of leverage can lead to increasing income:

*   **Employee**: Made four figures a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Gained [[leveraging_time_and_opportunities_for_wealth | leverage]] over his own time, reaching five figures a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Employing others (Collaboration)**: The first level of **leverage**, leading to six figures a month through gyms and the turnaround business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Licensing (Content)**: Creating content that multiple people could access, moving to seven figures a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Acquisition.com (Capital + Content + Collaboration)**: Investing in companies, attracting businesses through content, and utilizing teams, resulting in eight figures a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Strategy for Maximizing Leverage

[[strategies_for_maximizing_business_profits | Strategy]] involves allocating limited resources (time and money) towards options that yield the most leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

### Investing in Yourself (SME 500)

Instead of solely investing in the S&P 500 (which yields about 9-10% annually), one should consider investing in the "SME 500" – **self-made entrepreneurship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Investing in skills can provide returns far exceeding market averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. A thousand-dollar investment in sales training, for instance, could increase annual income by $180,000, and this benefit compounds annually because the skill is retained and improved upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

> "The one thing that no government can take from you and no wife can steal from you in a divorce and you can't get sued out of is your education. They can't take it from you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>

### Practical Steps to Gain Leverage

1.  **Get Paid to Learn**: Seek jobs that actively teach valuable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. This may mean taking a lower-paying role to acquire essential knowledge, transitioning from "earning to learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
2.  **Live Below Your Means**: Minimize personal expenses to "stack cash." This financial stability allows an entrepreneur to take calculated risks and go on the offensive with their business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
3.  **Start a Side Hustle (as a Transition)**: Use a side hustle not for extra income, but to build skills and eventually match your main income. Sustain this for about six months to ensure consistency, then transition fully into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
4.  **Stick to Your Industry**: It is difficult to make up years of experience in a new industry. Consider a "half pivot" within your existing field or switch roles within the same industry to leverage existing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

### The Infinite Game

Business is an "infinite game" with known and unknown players and no agreed-upon rules; the objective is simply to keep the game going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Entrepreneurs often lose by approaching this infinite game with a "finite frame" – focusing on short-term outcomes or "winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. Instead, the goal is to find activities you genuinely enjoy enough to continue playing throughout your life, even if the "vehicle" or specific role changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

By continuously learning and accumulating skills, an entrepreneur's "baseline skill" level grows, making them increasingly effective regardless of the specific business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This is how one moves from earning a modest income to making millions, constantly raising their minimum potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

The most crucial foundational skill to acquire is **sales**, as it is the first part of the equation for making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

The economic landscape underwent a "massive shift" in 2022, prompting a change in traditional [[wealth_creation_strategies | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. With inflationary pressures, a struggling [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] market, and crashes in crypto and stocks, it became crucial to reassess how capital is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Reassessing Cash Holdings: Banks vs. US Treasuries

Traditionally, cash is held in bank accounts, but this approach offers low returns and carries risks.

### The Problem with Banks
When money is deposited in a bank, the depositor is essentially loaning the bank money, becoming a creditor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Banks then loan this money out, either to the government by buying bonds or to individuals for mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Banks profit significantly from this arrangement, paying depositors as little as 0.1% to 1% annually, while earning around 4% from the government on the same funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Furthermore, there's a risk of losing funds beyond the FDIC-insured amount if a bank fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Alternative: US Treasuries
A more advantageous alternative for holding cash is investing in US Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk:** The US government is less likely to go bankrupt than a bank, as it can print money to repay its debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Higher Returns:** US Treasuries typically offer higher returns than traditional bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Liquidity:** Loans can be taken against Treasuries for up to 80% of their value, allowing investors to access capital while still earning interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Philosophy

The speaker outlines a personal journey of evolving [[wealth_creation_strategies | investment strategies]]:

1.  **Self-Investment (Initial Phase):** The highest-return [[investment_strategies_for_small_capital | investment]] initially was in self-improvement, including learning skills, gaining access to mentors, coaching, and workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  **S&P 500 (Second Phase):** Once personal reinvestment opportunities diminished, excess capital was allocated to the S&P 500, following the advice of prominent investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
3.  **Barbell Strategy (Post-Sale):** After selling three companies, a "barbell strategy" was adopted, focusing on stocks and [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]], with very little in between, complemented by private equity in owned companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:04:00]</a>. However, this strategy led to infrequent investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Importance of Investing in Your Knowledge Base

A pivotal shift in the speaker's [[personal_finance_strategies | investment philosophy]] came from insights derived from Dave Ramsey's analysis of Graham Stephan's portfolio.

> "If we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base it would be 80% [[real_estate_investment_strategies | real estate]] 20% stocks maybe so where you invest is what you know..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

This highlighted a crucial principle: successful investors, particularly billionaires, tend to focus on a few areas they deeply understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Their portfolios reflect their knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This concept aligns with the idea of [[diversification_and_personal_knowledge_in_investing | investing based on personal knowledge]] rather than broad diversification into unfamiliar areas.

## Revised Investment Strategy: Singular Focus

The realization was that the previous "barbell strategy" was someone else's, not aligned with the speaker's core expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The speaker's strength lies in service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

> "It's only risky if you don't know what you're doing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

This quote from Warren Buffett underscores the importance of expertise. For those who lack specific investment knowledge, the advice is to invest in broad indexes like the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, [[wealth_creation_strategies | outsized returns]] come from playing in a "game where you have an unfair advantage" â€“ where you possess more knowledge than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The revised [[investment_and_company_growth_strategies | investment strategy]] has reverted to a singular focus:
1.  **Invest in yourself:** Acquire skills and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
2.  **Invest excess in indexes:** For general exposure when specific expertise isn't applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Deploy stockpiled capital into your main game:** Once confident in your expertise, invest heavily in private deals within your area of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This approach emphasizes doing what you know well, doing it better, and consistently applying that focus over time to achieve significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

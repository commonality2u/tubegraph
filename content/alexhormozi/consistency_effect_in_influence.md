The consistency effect is a powerful [[reciprocity_in_persuasion|persuasion]] tool that leverages human nature to judge individuals based on their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It is considered one of the highest leveraged skills in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Robert Cialdini's research on persuasion, accessible through his book *Influence*, highlights this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## How Consistency is Used in Persuasion

The principle of consistency involves asking someone to publicly commit to an idea or action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This public commitment can be made directly to you or widely to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The strategy is to remind individuals of their prior commitments, encouraging them to be consistent with those commitments in future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

For example, asking someone if they are the "type of person who takes action and is willing to invest in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> can set a precedent. If they affirm this, you can later frame an offer by reminding them of their self-identification, stating, "since you're the type of person who's really willing to take action and really likes to invest in themselves, I think this would be perfect for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Research Study on Consistency

A notable research study demonstrated this effect:
*   Initially, residents in a neighborhood were asked to place a massive "Please Drive Slowly" sign on their front yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Most did not comply with this large request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   In contrast, when a different group was first asked to put a tiny, note-card-sized "Please Drive Slowly" sign in their window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, and then two weeks later received a letter asking if they would place a much larger sign because they were "pro-safety for the neighborhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, significantly more people agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   This success was attributed to people voluntarily identifying as a certain type of person and the researchers getting them to remain consistent with that initial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The takeaway from this study is that to "get the big yes, sometimes you get the small yes first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Application in Business

This principle is effectively applied in business through:
*   **Lead Magnets:** Offering free or low-cost initial items (like free gum in a classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, or a tiny sign in a window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>) helps to secure a small "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Front-End Offers:** These small commitments pave the way for customers to ultimately make a much larger purchase later, as they align with their previously established consistent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

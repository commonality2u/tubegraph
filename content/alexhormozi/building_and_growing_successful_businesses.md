The hardest respect to earn is one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Alex Hormozi and his wife created Acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies that generate approximately $85 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. People often ask how to [[building_a_valuable_business | create these businesses]], [[the_importance_of_building_and_selling_skills_for_entrepreneurs | sell products]], and live a successful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The core purpose of understanding [[effective_business_frameworks_for_growth | business growth and scaling strategies]] is to learn how to actively build wealth and an empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Tri-Component Goal Achievement Model

People often get "tripped up" when trying to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. There are three key elements to any goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>:

1.  **External Result**: The desired outcome, such as making more money or achieving a physical goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
2.  **Processes/Behaviors**: The activities performed to achieve the goal, which is "doing the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
3.  **Identity (Being)**: Becoming the type of person who inherently performs those necessary behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This concept, often summarized as "Be-Do-Have," is discussed by behavioral psychologists and authors like James Clear in *Atomic Habits* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Flaw in Goal-Setting Alone

Simply writing down a goal, while providing direction, is not a guarantee of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
> "Winners and losers have the same goals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

In business, everyone aims to increase revenue or gain more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The uniqueness lies not in the goal, but in what happens beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If two individuals have the same goal but only one achieves it, the goal itself isn't the primary driver of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Beyond Activities: The "Why Not?"

Digging deeper, the behaviors that create the goal are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, to get more customers, one needs to "advertise" (make known) through private communications (e.g., cold calls, DMs) or public communications (e.g., social media posts, broadcasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While people often know what activities are necessary, they frequently fail to do them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The central question becomes: *why not, and how can we correct this?* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>

## The Keystone Habit: Identity-Based Action

The simplest and most effective "hack" for success and [[Building and Maintaining Wealth | building wealth]] is to consistently ask yourself:
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
> "What would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

This refrain helps shift identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Instead of remembering a long checklist of activities, asking this question serves as a powerful chorus throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Examples of this question in practice:
*   "What would a wise man do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   "What would a billionaire do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   "What would someone 10 times smarter than me do in this situation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   "What would a person with a six-pack do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   "What would an amazing husband do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

This framework can be applied to a vast number of scenarios, fixing the "being" rather than just the "habit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Reinforcing Identity Through Evidence

Affirmations alone ("I am a lion") are generally ineffective unless backed by action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. To become the person you desire, you must create *evidence* through consistent activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Your identity (from Latin "repeated beingness") is literally shaped by what you repeatedly do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This creates a reinforcing cycle: "I am this type of person, therefore I do these things, and because I do these types of things, I am this type of person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Applying to Business Growth

To build a [[building_a_valuable_business | valuable business]] or [[frameworks_and_lessons_in_building_successful_businesses | achieve business success]], identify the type of person you need to become (e.g., a billionaire, a successful entrepreneur) and then consistently ask, "What would that person do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Consider role models who embody desired traits:
*   King Solomon (rich and wise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>
*   Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger (for [[investment_and_financial_advice_for_business_growth | investment and financial advice]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Even a spiritual figure like Jesus (for moral guidance and actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>

### Addressing the "I Don't Know" Objection

Often, when people say they don't know what a successful person would do, they actually *do* know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
> "We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>

Most people know what they need to do to achieve their goals but aren't taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, if a family were kidnapped, individuals would take massive action to save them, demonstrating they knew what to do all along but lacked the motivating circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

If you genuinely don't know, you can:
*   Start with a more attainable identity (e.g., "What would a millionaire do?" or "What would someone trying to become a millionaire do?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   Seek knowledge from those who have achieved similar success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## The Path to Effortless Change

The people who achieve extraordinary things do the "uncommonly obvious thing for an inordinate period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. They do it because it's *who they are*, not just to achieve an external outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This internal motivation allows them to "play the game indefinitely," leading to outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Conversely, someone driven solely by external money might pull back once they hit a financial target, hindering sustained [[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | growth]] and [[building_a_sustainable_business_model | building a sustainable business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

By asking "What type of person do I wish to become?" and making that question a guiding principle, you can create deep, long-lasting change that eventually becomes effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This shifts your identity, which in turn directs the actions you take, reinforcing who you are becoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

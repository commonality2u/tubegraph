For service-based businesses looking to scale, the franchise model is one of four primary vehicles for growth and wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This model involves allowing investors to buy into a proven business concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Defining a Franchise
A true franchise legally requires three core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>:
1.  **Name/Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
2.  **Business Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
3.  **Fee** (e.g., royalties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

If a business operates using all three of these components without being registered as a franchise, it can be considered an illegal franchise, leading to fines and potential shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Examples of well-known franchises include Subway, McDonald's, and Jiffy Lube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Advantages of the Franchise Model
*   **Lower Failure Rates (in theory)**: Franchises are often perceived to have significantly lower failure rates compared to starting an independent business from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **High Enterprise Value**: The enterprise value (EV) of a franchise is extremely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **High Margins**: Franchise royalties, when collected, come with high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Disadvantages and Considerations for Franchisors
Despite perceived advantages, the franchise model comes with significant challenges for the franchisor:
*   **Litigious and Expensive to Start**: Establishing a franchise is highly litigious and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Initial setup fees, legal costs, and filings typically cost around $750,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Slow to Profit**: It often takes one to two years for a franchisor to start seeing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The upfront franchise fee (around $50,000) usually only covers the cost of acquiring franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. True profit comes from ongoing royalties from the top line once locations are operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Operational Costs**: Franchisors still bear the costs of running the actual franchise operation and supporting their franchisees' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Profit Distribution**: Franchisors only earn a small percentage off the top line, as franchisees own the vast majority of the business's profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The franchise multiple (valuation) applies only to the corporate franchise revenue, not the total revenue of all franchisee-owned locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Scale for Profitability**: For a franchise to be genuinely profitable for the franchisor, it typically needs to have 100 or more locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   **Reality Check**: A significant challenge in the [[franchise_model_and_its_impact_on_franchisee_profits | franchise model]] is that 90% to 95% of franchises never reach 100 locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This highlights that simply "franchising your business" is not the end goal, but rather the beginning of a complex journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

> "As much as people have service-based business and think that the ultimate goal is to build a franchise so that someday they can franchise their business, the franchise is not the end goal, it is the beginning of the next journey." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>

## When to Choose a Franchise Model
The franchise model is best suited for service-based businesses with:
*   **Very High Build-Out Costs**: If opening a new location requires a substantial capital investment (e.g., millions of dollars for a McDonald's), franchising allows the franchisor to offload this capital risk to individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This is essentially "crowdsourcing" the ownership of new locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Productized Service**: The service offered must be highly standardized and "productized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This means:
    *   **Minimized Variability**: The service should taste or perform the same regardless of who provides it, like making a sandwich at Subway with standardized recipes and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   **Decreased Skill Requirements**: The labor required to operate the system should not demand highly specialized skills, making it easier to train and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

If the service requires specialized skills or depends heavily on the individual's expertise, it becomes more difficult to scale via franchising due to potential inconsistencies in service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Overall Strategy
Choosing the right scaling vehicle, including franchising, depends on various factors such as required cash flow, upfront investment, time to market, and the entrepreneur's risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A franchise model might be considered if you know a new location will be highly successful but requires significant capital, leading you to [[delivery_models_and_scaling_business | crowdsource the ownership]] and take a royalty cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

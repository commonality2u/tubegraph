The economic landscape shifted significantly in 2022, prompting a change in investment strategies for many individuals. It is crucial to adapt one's approach to how money is deployed, as the economy has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For individuals with substantial assets, understanding where to position wealth is key to navigating periods of inflationary pressures, and market downturns in areas like real estate, crypto, and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Understanding Cash and Banks

Many wealthy individuals like Warren Buffett are said to have "cash equivalents," which doesn't mean literal cash sitting in a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When you deposit cash into a bank, you are essentially lending the bank money, making you a creditor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Banks then loan this money out, either to the government by purchasing bonds or to individuals for mortgages and other loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Banks generate significant profits by paying depositors a low annual interest rate (e.g., 0.1% to 1%) while earning much higher returns (e.g., 4% from government bonds), effectively making 40 times what they pay out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Key factors in lending are the interest rate and the likelihood of repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A major risk with bank deposits is that if a bank fails, you could lose money beyond the FDIC-insured amount, especially considering the FDIC is currently described as "bankrupt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Alternative: U.S. Treasuries

A superior alternative to holding cash in banks, offering lower risk and higher returns, is to purchase U.S. Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Treasuries are seen not just as an investment vehicle but as a safer "bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The U.S. government is considered less likely to default than a commercial bank because it can print money to repay debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Furthermore, you can typically take loans against Treasuries for up to 80% of their value while still earning interest on the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Banks typically do not highlight this option because it reduces their ability to profit from your deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Strategy

The speaker's [[investment_and_wealth_management | investment structure]] has evolved over time:

1.  **Early Phase**: The first significant investment was in oneself, focusing on learning skills, gaining access to people, coaching, mentorships, and workshops. This was considered the highest return investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This aligns with [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | investing in personal growth]].
2.  **Mid-Phase**: Once excess capital exceeded what could be reinvested in personal development, money was applied to the S&P 500, following the advice of investors like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
3.  **Post-Sale Phase**: After selling multiple companies, a "barbell strategy" was considered, balancing investments in stocks and real estate with private equity in owned companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, this strategy, proposed by a friend, led to a period of limited investment activity, as it wasn't aligned with the speaker's core expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Investing in Your Sphere of Knowledge

A pivotal insight came from an analysis by Dave Ramsey of Graham Stefan's investment portfolio. When Stefan's portfolio was heavily weighted in real estate (80%+), Ramsey posed a question: "What percentage of your knowledge is real estate versus stocks and bonds and other stuff?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When Stefan admitted 80-85% of his knowledge was in real estate, Ramsey concluded that it was a perfect distribution for him, as it reflected his expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This anecdote highlighted a crucial [[fundamentals_of_wealth_creation | principle of building wealth]]:
*   **Invest where you have knowledge**: Where you invest should align with what you know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Billionaire's approach**: Billionaires tend to do few things, but those things are what they understand, and they do a lot of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. They pick one or two games they know well and focus heavily on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The speaker realized his core expertise was in service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This shift in perspective led to a willingness to make substantial investments in areas directly within that expertise, even if they were larger than previous real estate considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

A key quote from Warren Buffett, "It's only risky if you don't know what you're doing," reinforces this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Buffett's advice to invest in the S&P 500 is often given because many people lack specific investment knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, outsized returns come from playing in a game where you have an unfair advantage and know more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Understanding the risks within your sphere of knowledge allows for more confident and appropriate investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## A Phased Approach to Investment

The recommended phased approach to [[building_and_maintaining_wealth | building and maintaining wealth]] is:

1.  **Invest in yourself**: Prioritize [[investing_in_personal_and_financial_growth | personal growth]] through skills, education, and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This represents [[the_role_of_longterm_investment_in_personal_growth | longterm investment in personal growth]].
2.  **Invest in indexes**: Once personal investment capacity is met, deploy excess capital into broad market indexes like the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Deploy into private deals**: When you become proficient in your main field, use accumulated capital to invest in private deals within your area of expertise. This deployment initiates the [[the_importance_of_compounding_and_patience_in_accumulating_wealth | compounding]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Conclusion: Singular Focus for Wealth Growth

The ultimate [[investment_and_wealth_management | investment strategy]] reverts to a core business strategy: singular focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. To achieve significant wealth growth, one should:
*   Do the things you know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Do them more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Do them better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Keep doing that for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

This focused approach, based on understanding and expertise, makes sustained success highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Ensuring customers consistently use a product after purchase is crucial for its effectiveness and for sustained benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This approach makes a salesperson both more effective and a better coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## The Challenge of New Habits

It is incredibly difficult to get someone to create a new habit or to break an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For products that require regular consumption or use, the goal is to integrate their usage into the customer's existing [[daily_routine_and_productivity_strategies | daily routine and productivity strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Strategy: Piggybacking on Existing Habits

The most effective way to encourage product usage is to "piggyback on habits they already have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This means associating the product's use with an activity the customer already performs consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Explain Usage Clearly:** Before making the sales ask, explain precisely how the product should be taken or used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
2.  **Identify Existing Routines:** Ask the customer about something they do every single morning without fail, such as brushing their teeth, drinking coffee, or taking a shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
3.  **Suggest Placement for Integration:** Advise them to place the product next to the item associated with their existing routine (e.g., "put it next to your toothbrush") to avoid creating a new habit from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This ensures they don't forget about it if it's hidden away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  **Pre-configure for Simplicity:** For supplements, this might involve suggesting specific dosages and even physical cues like putting a piece of tape with the dosage number on the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

By taking these steps, you guide the customer to integrate the product into their [[effective_habits_and_mindset_strategies | effective habits and mindset strategies]], making it easier for them to achieve the desired benefits and fostering trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This approach ensures the product is not just sold, but actually used, leading to better outcomes for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

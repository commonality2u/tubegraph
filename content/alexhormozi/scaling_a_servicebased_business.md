This article explores the only four ways to package a service, labor, and knowledge into a profitable business, focusing on how to grow and increase enterprise value. It's especially relevant for businesses with a profitable single-location model looking for the best path to maximize earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These methods offer different advantages regarding cash flow, profit margins, operational drag, and enterprise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Four Vehicles for Scaling

There are four primary models for [[Scaling business operations and managing growth | scaling a service-based business]]:

1.  **Privately Held Chain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
2.  **Franchise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
3.  **Licensing Model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
4.  **Software / Tech-Enabled Service** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

### 1. Privately Held Chain

A privately held chain involves opening multiple locations (e.g., a second, third, etc.) while retaining all ownership rights, taking all the risk, fronting all the capital, hiring all the labor, and controlling the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons

*   **Cons:** Highest costs for opening each new location due to build-out, lease negotiation, and staffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Risk is borne by the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. [[Challenges and lessons in scaling business operations | Inconsistency of service]] can be a problem if the service requires highly specialized skills, making it difficult to [[Scaling the unscalable in business | scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Pros:** You own everything end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Provides very good enterprise value (EV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **When to Consider:**
    *   **Low Build-Out Costs:** If a new location costs less than $40,000-$50,000, or less than six months' worth of profit generated in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **High Profit Margins:** For example, businesses like Insomnia Cookies have tiny locations and high profit margins from selling simple products, making it worthwhile to own everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Low Service Requirements:** The more a service can be "productized" to minimize variability and decrease the skill requirements of the labor, the more [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | scalable]] a private chain becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Speaker's Experience
> One of the speaker's businesses, which was initially a licensing model, was transitioned to a private chain because the licensees were making substantial money with the system and new locations cost very little to open. This transition led to growth from $500,000/year to $12 million/year in 14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 2. Franchise

A franchise involves licensing out a proven single business model to investors who buy into it, such as Subway or McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Investors are attracted by the theory of lower risk compared to starting a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons

*   **Cons:** Very litigious and expensive to start (around $750,000 for setup fees, legal, and filings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It's a slow model; most franchises don't see profits for one to two years, as upfront fees often only cover acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Profits are made from royalties on top-line revenue once locations are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. A franchise usually needs 100+ locations to make significant money, but 90-95% of franchises never reach this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Pros:** Offers extremely high enterprise value (EV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It allows you to shift significant capital risk to other people by "crowdsourcing" the ownership of new locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **When to Consider:** When new locations have very high build-out costs, like McDonald's (which can cost around $1 million to open) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Franchise Definition
> A franchise has three components: **name**, **business systems**, and **fee** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. If all three are present, and people are using your brand, systems, and paying a fee, you are operating a franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Operating as a license while having all three components is illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### 3. Licensing Model

A licensing model typically involves two out of the three franchise components (name, business systems, fee). For example, CrossFit licenses its name and has a fee but doesn't mandate business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Another example is a white-labeled model where you license business systems and charge a fee, but without a specific brand name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is a way to package existing knowledge or intellectual property (IP) for [[Scaling businesses quickly | rapid scaling]] to multiple locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons

*   **Cons:** Not very defensible and offers very little enterprise value (low multiples on sale) unless there's an extremely sticky licensing agreement, ideally with 80%+ yearly retention for licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Pros:** Lowest cost to start (almost no cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Super high margins and can generate cash flow from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Allows for immense speed to outpace competitors in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **When to Consider:** When capital is limited and generating cash flow sooner is a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Also suitable if the intellectual property (IP) is not highly protectable, such as an offer-based business that is easy to copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Speaker's Experience
> The speaker's first business, Gym Launch, was a licensing business because they didn't have substantial initial capital and wanted to generate cash flow quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### 4. Software / Tech-Enabled Service

This model applies if the service can be partially or entirely replaced by software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. For most service-based businesses, this will not be the primary scaling strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons

*   **Cons:** Requires a significant upfront cost to build and a lot of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Initially has very low cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Requires a co-founder with software development, user experience, and engineering team building expertise; outsourcing development usually fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. If yearly customer retention is below 80%, it will not be considered true software and will lose its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Pros:** Generally has the highest enterprise value on exit, but only if the strict retention requirements (80% or higher yearly retention) are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Vehicle

When considering how to [[Scaling a personal styling business | scale]] a service-based business, it's crucial to evaluate which of these four approaches best fits your specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Factors to consider include:

*   The nature of your intellectual property (IP) and the value you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   Your required cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   The amount of upfront investment you're willing or able to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   The time frame for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   Your appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   The structural soundness and reliability of the model's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

For instance, if you are certain of success in a new market and the cost to open is low, a privately held chain makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. If you know you'll be successful but the cost per location is high, franchising might be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. For non-protectable IP, licensing offers speed and high cash flow throughout the process, though it sacrifices a large lump sum at exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Conversely, software development involves significant upfront investment and low initial cash flow but promises a high exit valuation if it achieves high customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

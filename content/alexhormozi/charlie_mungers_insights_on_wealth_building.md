The first $100,000 is often cited as the hardest amount of money to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This idea is echoed by Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, who famously stated that "the first hundred grand is a he even says that uh it's a quote you can look it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Why the First $100,000 is the Hardest

The difficulty of accumulating the initial $100,000 stems from several key factors:

### 1. Thinking in Time-for-Money Vehicles
When setting a goal of $100,000, individuals tend to focus on opportunities that require exchanging time for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This approach is inherently constraining because one's time is finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, to earn $10 million, one cannot simply multiply $100,000 time-based efforts by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Achieving larger sums necessitates a different mode of operation, often moving beyond direct time-for-money exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Leverage
At the outset of [[wealth_creation_strategies | wealth creation]], individuals typically have little to no financial leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This means they must perform all tasks themselves, leading to significant inefficiency and a large time investment for minimal output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. They must learn every aspect of a business to earn their first dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Once the first $100,000 is accumulated, however, it provides the capital to start paying others to handle tasks, invest in advertising, and ultimately [[leveraging_time_and_opportunities_for_wealth | leverage]] resources for faster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This shift allows for greater efficiency and the ability to scale efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Speaker's Personal Experience

The speaker shares that the first $100,000 they deposited into their bank account was by far the most meaningful financial milestone of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This sum provided a profound sense of relief and security, offering enough money to sustain them for three and a half years, even if mistakes were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The proportional increase in security experienced going from effectively zero to $100,000 was significantly greater than the increase felt when reaching $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Skill Stacking and Increased Leverage

As individuals acquire new skills, their base earning potential, or "basement of skills," continuously rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, learning how to sell could establish a baseline income of $250,000 per year, as one could always find work selling cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Adding marketing skills could further elevate this baseline, potentially to $3 million annually, by enabling the generation of demand at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

This [[fundamentals_of_wealth_creation | skill stacking]] approach views an entrepreneurial journey not as failures, but as lessons that inherently increase one's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The speed of skill acquisition can be enhanced through deliberate practice, mentorship, and paying experts to learn faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

A core principle is that one cannot be both "busy and broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If busy, one should be making money; if broke, one has time to invest in income-generating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The initial phase often requires trading time for money, but this effort builds the foundation for future [[achieving_financial_success_and_wealth | financial success]] and the ability to identify and pursue larger opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

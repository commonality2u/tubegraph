The speaker, an entrepreneur, shares a personal approach to [[flexible_eating_and_understanding_body_type | flexible eating]] that has allowed them to maintain a six-pack for 20 years while eating dessert almost every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method, adopted by many entrepreneurs who observe it, accommodates business dinners and drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While not scientifically researched, it is presented as a system that works for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Principles

The dietary approach is based on three steps:

### 1. Determine Your Calorie Goal

First, identify your objective: whether you aim to gain or lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A coefficient scale from 7 to 21 is used, representing extreme weight loss (7), moderate weight loss (10-12), maintenance (13-15), moderate weight gain, and extreme weight gain (21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

To calculate your target daily calories, multiply your body weight by the chosen coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **Example (Moderate Cut):** For a 200 lb individual aiming for a moderate cut, multiply 200 lbs by 10 (coefficient) to get 2,000 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Example (Maintenance):** For a 200 lb individual aiming for maintenance, multiply 200 lbs by 15 (coefficient) to get 3,000 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Activity levels or physical jobs are not considered initially, as the system allows for real-time adjustment of the coefficient if weight loss is too rapid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### 2. Prioritize Protein Intake

Next, determine your daily protein target by multiplying your body weight by 1 gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Example:** A 200 lb person would aim for 200 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   One pound of lean meat (such as white fish, ground turkey, ground beef, or shrimp) contains approximately 100 grams of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Therefore, 200 grams of protein would equate to 2 pounds of meat if eaten exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The speaker personally consumes more than 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight because it provides satiety and makes them feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 3. Utilize Flexible Calories

The final step involves calculating the remaining calories after accounting for your protein intake. These calories can be used flexibly for any other foods or drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Example (Moderate Cut):** If your target is 2,000 calories and you consume 2 pounds of turkey (200g protein at 560 calories per pound, totaling 1,120 calories), you would have 880 calories remaining (2,000 - 1,120 = 880) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These 880 calories can be allocated to business dinners, cocktails, or even an entire pint of ice cream or two large cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Example (Maintenance):** With a 3,000-calorie target, and the same protein intake, you would have an additional 1,000 calories available for flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Daily Meal Structure

The speaker's typical daily routine:

*   **Breakfast:** A 200-calorie bar (e.g., Quest Bar) with 20g of protein, followed by a shake (160 calories, 30g protein), totaling 360 calories and 50g protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Lunch:** One pound of turkey (560 calories, 100g protein) and half a cup of rice, leading to 1,140 total calories and 150g protein consumed by lunchtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Dinner:** This is the primary "flex meal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The speaker tends to eat another pound of protein, but emphasizes that if daily protein goals are met, the dinner can be entirely flexible within the remaining calorie budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Protein helps with satiety, which is why the speaker chooses to eat it for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The speaker takes a multivitamin to supplement green intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This flexible approach has proven effective, with individuals reporting significant weight loss using the method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

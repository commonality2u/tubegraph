From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

[[the_impact_of_friendships_on_personal_growth and success | Friendships]] often evolve throughout life, and for those pursuing [[foundational_personal_development_for_success | rapid personal growth]] and [[challenges_of_becoming_successful | success]], the need to change social circles can be a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker views life in "three to five year Seasons" and sheds relationships that no longer provide value, enabling quick personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Shedding Old Circles for New Growth

The speaker notes a pattern of leaving friends behind after significant life transitions, such as graduating high school and college, as part of their [[identity_and_personal_transformation | personal transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This willingness to let go is tied to a belief that most people are not "Bound for greatness" due to their choices and inherent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The notion of friends leaving their hometown and forgetting their roots is a societal narrative, often told by the majority who get left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The ability to pursue desired outcomes in life requires a willingness to pay the "price," and this often includes making difficult choices about one's social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### The Price of Greatness
The speaker states that "winners and losers have the same goals" and that uniqueness comes from the "willingness to pay the price" to achieve those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Achieving [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | greatness]] often means making different choices than the majority, which impacts social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Impact of Old Relationships on Identity
A significant reason for cutting people out is to avoid the "labels they speak over me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. People from one's past often hold onto the previous [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] they knew, and may "beat that label into you" when you try to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While individuals see themselves as growing, old friends may perceive it as merely changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The best response to "You've changed" is simply "Yeah, you haven't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Old friends might also reinforce past negative behaviors or stories, hindering progress towards desired character traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. [[Identity and Personal Transformation | Shedding identities]] is a core part of entrepreneurship, requiring a willingness to declare "I am no longer this way" and "I will no longer behave in this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## The Nature of Relationships and Sacrifice

The strength of a relationship is directly proportional to what one is willing to give up to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This perspective serves as a filter for determining which [[the_impact_of_friendships_on_personal_growth_and_success | friendships]] are most valued and worth sacrificing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Relationships as Transactions
The speaker argues that all relationships are transactional, meaning there's an exchange where both parties gain something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. From a behavioral standpoint, exchanges are either reinforced or punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The willingness to wait for positive reinforcement in a relationship is linked to a history of positive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, if there's no positive reinforcement over time, a relationship will eventually be cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Setting Boundaries and Valuing Time
The speaker illustrates this point with a personal story about a former teacher who helped them develop physically and academically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. When asked for a two-hour weekly call, the speaker declined, stating they weren't willing to dedicate 100 hours a year indefinitely to "pay a debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[impact_of_daily_routines_on_personal_growth | prioritizing time, focus, and energy]] towards one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Navigating Social Expectations and Finding New Connections

Society often tells a romanticized story of "friends for life," leading people to feel guilt or believe they are a "bad friend" for ending relationships that no longer serve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, making room in one's life for new connections is also an act of being a "good friend" to those future relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Honest Communication
When a relationship naturally fizzles out by reducing communication, it's often unspoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, if the closeness of a relationship makes a conversation necessary, the speaker encourages direct and honest communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Telling the truth, even if difficult, leads to either "better relationships or you'll be done with this Mickey Mouse" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This honesty can also give a past friend a chance to recognize that their own path might have diverged from their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Building New Communities
After shedding old friends, the best course of action is to join new communities where individuals share similar goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. By committing time and effort, one can rise within these communities, gain status, and "LeapFrog into other communities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This process allows individuals to surround themselves with "rare people" who are also pursuing "epic" achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The speaker is comfortable having had many friends across different seasons of life, viewing these connections as valuable for their duration, not necessarily forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

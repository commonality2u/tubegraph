Effective ad targeting is crucial for business success, influencing not only lead generation but also the efficiency of sales operations and overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Improper targeting can lead to wasted resources, low show rates, and poor conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Understanding Ad Targeting

Ad targeting refers to the process of identifying and reaching the specific demographic or psychographic group that is most likely to be interested in a product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It defines "who's actually seeing this promotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

For instance, targeting "teeny boppers" for a laser hair removal appointment would be ineffective, as they are not the intended audience, leading to scheduled appointments that don't materialize into sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This directly impacts the show rate, which is the percentage of people who show up for their appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Impact of Incorrect Ad Targeting

In one business case, the target audience was intended to be 25-35 year olds who were gainfully employed and loved their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, the actual targeting was for 18-24 year olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This discrepancy resulted in a significantly low 49% show rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The reason for this mis-targeting was an incorrect [[Effective Ad Creation and Optimization Techniques | ad objective]] where the media buyer was optimizing for the lowest cost leads and lowest cost appointments, rather than qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This meant that the sales team was spending considerable time cancelling 75% of their appointments, essentially "literally burning money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Optimizing Ad Targeting

To correct the issue, the ad objective was switched to optimize around **cost per sale** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. By optimizing for who genuinely converts into a sale, the source of sales shifts to more qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This change was implemented by addressing a personnel issue, replacing the negligent media buyer with a new person who could correctly target the intended audience of 25-35 year olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Results of Optimized Ad Targeting

Along with other sales process improvements, fixing the ad targeting contributed significantly to a 70% increase in show rate, reaching the benchmark of 70% from a previous 49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This 40% improvement in sales was achieved in just two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

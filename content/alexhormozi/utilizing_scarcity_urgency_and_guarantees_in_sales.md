To effectively sell the same thing for more money, the key is to create offers so compelling that potential customers "feel stupid saying no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This principle is considered the most impactful lever for business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## The Power of the Offer

An "offer" is the specific package of value given in exchange for money, bridging the product and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Identifying a Weak Offer
A "shitty offer" can be identified by several signs:
*   Difficulty in acquiring leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   Low conversion rates where most people don't want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   Customers comparing prices to competitors, leading to price-driven rather than value-driven decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Benefits of a Strong Offer
When an offer is strong, it connects with a large segment of the market, leading to significant financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. It compels the entire niche to feel they "need this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, making lead generation and sales much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

A strong offer enables a shift from price-driven decisions to value-driven decisions, where customers want the product so much they perceive it as unique and irreplaceable, allowing for premium pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

Key outcomes of a strong offer:
*   Increased response rates on advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   Higher conversion rates (more sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   [[High ticket sales strategies | Premium pricing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

An example from a Facebook ads agency showed how simply changing the offer, without altering the underlying business mechanics, transformed a negative return on advertising into an 11.2x return, increasing sales 22 times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

## Selling to the Right People

The value derived from a service or product often depends more on "who you find" than "what you provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Working with clients who are inherently more valuable allows for greater compensation for the same amount of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, providing significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

A story illustrates this: A man who helped a stranded motorist was rewarded with his mortgage paid off, not because of the act itself, but because the motorist happened to be a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of choosing whom to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. It's crucial to be able to say "no" to undesirable clients to make room for those who will pay more and are better to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Ideal Markets
When choosing a market or customer segment, look for four characteristics:
1.  **Pain:** Do they have a problem you can solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>? Find the "starving crowd" â€” underserved segments with significant needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Purchasing Power:** Do they have the money to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>? Avoid audiences who cannot afford your service, as seen in the example of an unemployed person struggling to afford a $300 consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Transparently communicating price early on can filter out those who cannot afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Easy to Find:** Are they aggregated and easily targetable for advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>? Niches with associations, Facebook groups, or professional services make targeting much simpler across various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.
4.  **Growing:** Is the market expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>? Choosing a growing market means you "grow by default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>, akin to Warren Buffett's analogy: "It wasn't about how hard you row but the boat you're in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. A great manager in a bad market will still lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

## Charging a Lot of Money (The Right Price)

A guiding principle is to "charge as much as you can without cracking a smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. This relates to the concept of price-to-value discrepancy: price is what you pay, value is what you get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. Everyone wants a bargain, regardless of the absolute price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

### The Virtuous Cycle of Price
Instead of lowering prices (the "hard way" that leads to competing on price and becoming a commodity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>, focus on increasing value. This creates a "value-driven decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

The "virtuous cycle of price" demonstrates that increasing your price leads to:
*   Increased emotional investment and perceived value from prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.
*   Better results for clients due to their higher investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.
*   Less demanding clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.
*   More revenue per customer, allowing for reinvestment in value and better service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>.
*   Increased profit, personal satisfaction, and perception of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.
*   Higher [[Conviction in sales and its importance | sales team conviction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>, as they genuinely believe in the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>.

Conversely, lowering prices creates a "vicious cycle" of decreased emotional investment, perceived value, results, and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

Price itself is a component of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. Studies show that when people are told a product is expensive, they perceive its value as higher, even if it's the same product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. The goal is to be so much more expensive that consumers categorize your solution differently from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

In services where client participation is necessary for success, charging more ensures higher investment, leading to better student/client outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. An example is a weight loss challenge where participants paid a refundable $500, resulting in a 78% success rate, significantly higher than typical gym memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.

Raising prices can also automatically [[Improving sales techniques for closing deals | increase the quality of your prospects]], filtering out less capable clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. One weight loss brand saw its revenue double, ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) increase from 5:1 to 10:1, and profit triple, simply by raising prices by 50% without other changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>.

## Reverse Engineering Value

Value can be systematically engineered using a formula with four key variables:
1.  **Dream Outcome:** Ensure the offer delivers something truly desired by the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:49:00">[37:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:** Increase confidence that the outcome is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Speed of Achievement:** Deliver results as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>.
4.  **Effort & Sacrifice (Ease):** Make the process as easy as possible for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>.

Additionally, to increase value and drive sales, incorporate:
*   [[Scarcity and urgency as persuasion tools | Scarcity]] (limited availability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
*   [[Understanding the role of urgency and taking action | Urgency]] (time-limited offers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
*   [[How to create compelling offers | Guarantees]] (reducing perceived risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.
*   Bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
*   Unique Naming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.

By combining these elements, businesses can create offers that justify higher prices by providing overwhelming value, making it difficult for prospects to decline.

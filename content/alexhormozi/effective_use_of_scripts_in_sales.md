Sales scripts and frameworks are essential tools for anyone looking to start a business or improve their sales performance, providing a structured approach to customer interactions and lead generation. This article outlines key strategies for leveraging scripts across various sales channels, from warm outreach to paid advertising.

## Why Use a Script?
Using a script provides a clear roadmap for interactions, especially when starting out. If you don't know what you're doing, "just stick with the script" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. It ensures you hit key points and maintain focus. While it might seem less impressive to follow a script, it provides necessary guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. After conducting numerous interactions (20, 30, or 50), you'll naturally develop your own rhythm, allowing the script to become more of an outline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Core 4 Ways to Get Customers
The video highlights four primary ways to acquire customers, referred to as the "core 4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>:
1.  Warm Outreach (talking to people you know one-on-one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>
2.  Posting Free Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>
3.  Cold Outreach (reaching out to strangers one-on-one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>
4.  Running Paid Ads (talking to people you don't know one-to-many) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>

### 1. Warm Outreach: Leveraging Your Network
The easiest way to get customers initially is to contact people you already know, starting with your phone contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

#### Script Elements for Warm Outreach:
*   **Personalized Opening**: Start with a personalized tidbit, possibly from social media, to build rapport. A good compliment can tie into a positive character trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Leading Questions**: Ask questions that direct the conversation towards your service, such as inquiring about a problem your service solves (e.g., "Is anyone taking out your trash?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Frame your service as saving them time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Offer Free Service/Case Study**: Offer to do the service for free for a few people to get testimonials and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Frame**: Emphasize that *they* are helping *you* by allowing you to provide the service and get feedback or a review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Avoid sounding resentful that you're giving away free work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome Scenarios**: Clearly outline what you expect: either a positive review if the service is good, or constructive feedback if it needs improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization from Free Service**:
    *   **Customer Conversion**: They become paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Reviews/Testimonials**: They leave a review, which can attract future customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Referrals**: They send you a friend or introduce you to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Feedback**: They offer suggestions for improvement, which is valuable for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Asking for Introductions**: Instead of asking them for business directly, ask if they know anyone else who might benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Request a three-way text introduction *immediately* to ensure leads are captured and to leverage social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content: The Hook-Retain-Reward Framework
Creating valuable free content is another way to attract customers by making your audience want more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

#### The Hook-Retain-Reward (HRR) Framework:
*   **Hook (First 3 Seconds)**: The first three seconds are crucial for grabbing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Use:
    *   Curiosity-inducing statements ("Trash is gross to everyone but me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
    *   Crazy topics, questions, facts, or jarring statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Retain**: Keep the audience engaged by providing value in a structured way:
    *   **Frameworks**: Introduce two-step frameworks or lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Open Loops**: Present information in a way that makes the audience curious for the next step (e.g., "way number one... what's number two?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Content Types**: Use lists, steps, stories, or combinations thereof to maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Reward**: Provide a concluding element, which can be:
    *   **Shareable Content**: Something funny or subversive that encourages sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Call to Action (CTA)**: Direct the audience to take a specific action (e.g., call a number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

#### Tips for Content Creation:
*   **Remind More Than Teach**: People need to be reminded frequently. Don't assume your audience consumes all your content or remembers everything from a single viewing. Repetition and variations are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Engagement = Leads**: Anyone who likes, engages, or comments on your posts is a lead. This engagement provides a natural reason to reach out without seeming like a "scumbag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.
*   **Reframe Views**: Instead of being discouraged by low view counts, imagine the number of views as the size of a room you're speaking to. This reframing can make the effort feel more worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Everyone starts small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### 3. Cold Outreach: Reaching Strangers One-on-One
Cold outreach involves contacting strangers via email, phone call, direct message, SMS, voicemail, or door-knocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

#### Script Elements for Cold Outreach (Door-to-Door Example):
*   **Visual Cues**: Dress in work clothes and carry items related to your service to create curiosity and demonstrate what you do before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Referrals/Social Proof**: Mention a neighbor or existing client (e.g., "I helped the Johnson's your neighbor") immediately to build trust and disarm the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>. This gives you more time for your pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.
*   **Leading Questions**: Ask if they already have someone performing the service, rather than directly asking if they want your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.
*   **Handle Objections/Existing Providers**:
    *   If they don't have someone, offer your service (ideally for free initially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
    *   If they do have someone, differentiate your offer. Ask if their current provider offers something you do (e.g., "Are they as awesome and smiley as me?") or if they do it for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.
*   **Big Fast Value (BFV) Offer**: For strangers, you need an amazing offer. A free trial or superior value incentivizes them to try your service when they don't yet trust you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.
*   **No-Based Questions**: Phrase questions to elicit a "no" that actually means "yes" (e.g., "Would you be opposed to me doing it for you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
*   **Rapport and Humor**: Being positive, upbeat, and even a little ridiculous can disarm people and make them less likely to be rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.
*   **Shut Up After Yes**: Once you get a "yes," stop talking. Anything more increases the risk of them changing their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.
*   **Accepting Rejection**: Door-to-door sales teaches resilience. "No is the price of yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>. Every rejection is a coin tossed towards a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.
*   **Building a List**: To reach strangers, you need contact information. Build lists using:
    *   **Software**: Export lists meeting your criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Brokers**: Purchase lists from list brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Elbow Grease**: Assemble your own "virgin" list from Yelp, Google Maps, online databases, or Facebook/Reddit groups. This method provides less "tired" leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
*   **Volume and Automation**: To overcome the "not enough replies" problem in cold outreach, focus on volume. Automate list building, phone systems, and cold DMs to increase reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>.

### 4. Running Paid Ads: One-to-Many for Strangers
Paid ads allow you to reach a large audience of strangers by paying platforms for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

#### Ad Script Structure:
Paid ads also follow a hook-retain-reward (or call to action) structure, similar to free content. The key difference is a clear call to action at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

*   **Call Out (before the hook)**: This explicitly targets your desired audience (e.g., "Las Vegas homeowners") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. Use visual or auditory cues.
*   **Hook**: The most important part, as 80% of people decide not to watch within the first 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Questions**: "Are you backed up in trash?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>
    *   **Relatable Scenarios**: "You missed your child's practice again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>
    *   **Curiosity/Humor**: "You smell that smell?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>
*   **Agitate the Pain**: Describe the specific pain points your target audience experiences related to the problem your service solves. This helps them connect with the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>. Use details (smell, chasing the truck, status concerns) to hit multiple pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>.
*   **Introduce Solutions/Benefits**: Present your service as the solution, often in a structured list (e.g., "three things we do better") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Guarantees**: Place guarantees to alleviate concerns (e.g., "three free months if we miss a pickup") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Service/Respect**: Highlight unique selling propositions, like exceptional customer service, if it addresses a common pain point in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: Clearly tell people what to do next (e.g., "click the link or call 1-800-Alex-Trash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.
*   **Avatar Alignment**: The setting and people in the ad should align with your target audience to attract the right type of customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>. Using diverse avatars can significantly increase reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Sales Skills
Regardless of the channel, learning to sell is a fundamental life skill. It involves learning to talk to people, developing thick skin, and understanding that rejections (Nos) are simply steps towards success (Yeses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. This skill is crucial for personal and professional interactions, from family to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.

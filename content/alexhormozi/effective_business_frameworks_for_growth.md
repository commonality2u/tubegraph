This article explores [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | scaling the unscalable]] and introduces key [[frameworks_for_business_scaling_and_success | frameworks for business scaling and success]], emphasizing that embracing seemingly non-scalable tasks is crucial for early-stage business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These [[frameworks_and_lessons_in_building_successful_businesses | lessons]] are drawn from years of experience, including founding and exiting nine businesses and managing a portfolio exceeding $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Embracing the "Unscalable"

Many entrepreneurs miss out on significant earnings by not leveraging their largest competitive advantage: the ability to engage in "unscalable" activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. What appears unscalable is often a "skill deficiency," not a physical impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The inability to scale often stems from a lack of context and resources in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

For instance, a fitness professional doing $30,000 a month in outbound sales hesitated to scale because it "requires people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, service businesses like fitness coaching scale by hiring and training people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Similarly, worrying about extreme future outcomes (like becoming "too bulky" in fitness) prevents taking the first step towards growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Businesses often discuss scaling to $100 million before even making initial revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### The Power of Direct Engagement

In the beginning, engaging in "unscalable" tasks like one-on-one calls with customers or writing handwritten cards is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Andy Forcella, founder of First Form, wrote handwritten cards to every customer when he started, a practice that continues even after achieving hundreds of millions in revenue, albeit with others now writing and him signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This demonstrates that an "unscalable" solution can evolve into a scaled version that retains 80% of its initial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Learning Through "Unscalable" Work

Performing tasks like customer calls, even for low-ticket items, is invaluable for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. From these interactions, businesses learn:
*   Customer pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Effective messaging and hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   How to improve products and offers for higher conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   What customers value most and least <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Asking customers:
1.  "If I were to eliminate all but one feature, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
2.  "If I were to eliminate one thing from my feature set and it changed nothing about your life, which one would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

Paul Graham's principle suggests that every business problem can be solved by talking to the customer more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This direct customer onboarding increases retention, referrals, and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Progression from "Unscalable" to Scaled Operations

Initial one-on-one interactions can evolve into:
*   **Semi-private:** One-on-six calls, increasing output by 6x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Group Onboarding:** One-on-twenty or one-on-thirty sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Training others:** Teaching employees to follow the established systems, thereby [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | scaling the unscalable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

This process allows for intensive learning in the beginning, which is then codified into presentations and systems that can be taught and replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### The "Swamp" of Business and Management Debt

Early business growth involves a "swamp" where you don't have enough money to hire extensively, requiring you to work overtime by performing multiple roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. While venture-backed companies incur financial debt to hire talent, self-funded businesses incur "management debt," meaning founders must take on the work of two, three, or four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This "unscalable" phase is necessary to reach the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

A common mistake is projecting future, scaled challenges back to the present, hindering initial action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Small businesses (under $10 million) have a unique advantage: they can implement highly efficient, personalized processes that large companies cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. For example, using iMessage with personalized voice notes or videos from a personal phone for sales outreach, rather than generic chat interfaces, yields higher response rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. While this might seem "unscalable" without resources, cash generated from these highly effective early efforts can be reinvested to create leverage for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Frameworks for Business Growth

Two key [[frameworks_for_business_scaling_and_success | frameworks for business scaling and success]] are introduced:

### 1. The Sales to Fulfillment Continuum

This framework states that for services, the easier something is to sell, the harder it generally is to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For example, a "done-for-you" promise is easy to sell but hard to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Conversely, a "do-it-yourself" offer is hard to sell but easy to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Many new businesses mistakenly start with the hardest-to-sell option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### 2. The Done For You / Done With You / Do It Yourself Pyramid

This [[strategies_for_business_growth_and_improvement | strategy]] suggests starting at the top of the pyramid with the most expensive, "done-for-you" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

*   **Done For You (Top of Pyramid):**
    *   **Description:** The most expensive service, where you do everything for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
    *   **Characteristics:** Easiest to sell (because it's comprehensive), hardest to fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Maximizes revenue per customer, sets up future products, delivers the best results, and forces the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. These SOPs productize the service for later, lower-tier offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
    *   **Example:** An agency offering full-service client management develops SOPs for lead magnets, ads, landing pages, and email follow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

*   **Done With You (Middle Layer):**
    *   **Description:** After establishing the "done-for-you" service and its SOPs, transition to a "done-with-you" consulting model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
    *   **Characteristics:** Typically charged at a fraction of the "done-for-you" price (e.g., one-third to one-fifth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Clients do the work, but with your guidance and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Allows for serving more clients with less intensive support, leveraging the productized elements from the top tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

*   **Do It Yourself (Bottom of Pyramid):**
    *   **Description:** The lowest-priced tier, where clients receive all the SOPs and tools to implement the solution entirely on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
    *   **Characteristics:** Very low support overhead, accessible to a mass market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Achieves maximum scale and reaches the widest audience.

The top-down approach is preferred for brand positioning, establishing premium pricing, and ensuring the highest results with initial customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This allows for easier transition downstream to larger customer bases with less operational drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. As you move down the pyramid, sales become harder, but your sales skills improve from extensive customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

By embracing "unscalable" work in the beginning and applying these [[key_business_strategies_for_growth | strategies for business growth]], entrepreneurs can effectively navigate challenges and achieve [[fast_business_growth_strategies | sustainable business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

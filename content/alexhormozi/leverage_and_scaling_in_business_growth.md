[[the_importance_of_leverage_in_business | Leverage]] is defined as how much you get for what you put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. In business, the goal is to maximize leverage, meaning getting a lot for a small investment of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

## Understanding Leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>
[[leverage_and_its_types_for_maximizing_business_success | Leverage]] allows you to achieve greater output for the same amount of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. While in the beginning of a venture, you may have low leverage, requiring high volume of work, this volume builds skill, which is a form of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. The more you do, the better you get, creating a virtuous cycle of work and improved outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

### Forms of Leverage
*   **Brand/Reputation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>: A strong brand leads to higher click-through rates on ads and higher conversion rates, even at higher prices, as people are more inclined to buy from a trusted source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. For example, a branded t-shirt might sell for $30 while a blank one for $5, yet the branded one has a higher likelihood of purchase due to the leverage of the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.
*   **People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>: By bringing in others with experience, you can expand your business potential beyond your own capabilities, effectively multiplying your efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. This is how successful leaders like Steve Jobs built massive companies, not by knowing how to build every component, but by building a team that could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Code/Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>: Writing code once that millions can use, or a book that continues to sell without additional effort, provides immense leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   **Skill** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>: As you gain experience and improve your skills, you become more efficient, getting more results per unit of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Scaling in Business Growth
[[business_growth_and_scaling_strategies | Scaling]] refers to the ability to increase output with minimal increases in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. It's not about whether something is scalable, but *how* scalable it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

### Elements of a Scalable Product/Service
A product or service that is designed for scalability typically possesses four key characteristics:
*   **Unique**: It has a proprietary element that prevents others from easily replicating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Expensive**: It commands a high price relative to its cost of production, leading to higher profit margins per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Sticky**: Customers repeatedly purchase the product or service, creating recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **"Air" (High Gross Profit)**: The cost to deliver the product is very low, meaning it costs pennies to make but can be sold for much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Coca-Cola is an example of a product that fits these criteria: it has a unique, secret recipe, is expensive relative to its production cost, is sticky (customers continue drinking it for life), and is "air" because it's cheap to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

### Incremental Cost of Adding a Customer
The core of [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | scalability]] lies in the incremental cost of adding a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The most scalable businesses incur almost no additional cost to bring on a new customer, such as cell phone carriers adding users to their network or platforms like Facebook or School adding new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

Conversely, businesses that are harder to scale often have high incremental costs or rely heavily on specialized, hard-to-replicate expertise, such as accounting firms or law firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. While still possible to scale, it requires more complex structures, like partnerships, to maintain quality and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Strategies for Increasing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
To make a customer worth more to your business, implement the following eight strategies:
1.  **Increase Price**: Charge more for the same product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. For beginners, a "five to five to five" model is recommended: after every five sales, bump the price by 20% until people stop buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
2.  **Decrease Costs**: Reduce the cost of making or delivering the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.
3.  **Increase Purchase Frequency**: Get customers to buy more times (e.g., subscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
4.  **Sell Other Products**: Offer new or complementary products (e.g., fries with a burger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
5.  **Increase Quantity Purchased**: Encourage customers to buy more units at once (e.g., bulk purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
6.  **Increase Quality**: Sell a higher-quality version of the product or service (e.g., premium ingredients, priority support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
7.  **Decrease Quantity (Downsell)**: Offer a smaller, less expensive version to convert a "no" into a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
8.  **Decrease Quality (Economy Version)**: Provide a discount or economy version of the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

For beginners, raising prices, increasing purchase frequency, and encouraging higher quantity purchases are the easiest to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

### The Role of Employees in Scaling
[[the_role_of_leadership_in_scaling_a_business | Scaling a business]] requires help from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. The size of a company is limited by the collective knowledge within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. By bringing in individuals with specialized knowledge (e.g., finance, HR), the business's potential expands significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The most valuable skill for a business owner is to get others to do tasks effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

### Management Diamond Framework
This framework addresses why an employee might not be performing as desired:
1.  **Didn't know what to do**: Lack of clear communication of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.
2.  **Didn't know how to do it**: Lack of training or process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. Solved by the "3Ds":
    *   **Document**: Create a step-by-step checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
    *   **Demonstrate**: Perform the task in front of them using the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
    *   **Duplicate**: Have them perform the task in front of you using the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
3.  **Didn't know when to do it by**: Lack of deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
4.  **Didn't know why to do it**: Lack of motivation or understanding of how their role contributes to the bigger picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
5.  **Something was blocking them**: External factors preventing task completion (e.g., lack of resources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

This framework helps diagnose and address performance issues, ensuring productive discussions rather than blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

### Three Pillars of Business
Businesses stand on three core pillars:
1.  **Acquisition**: Marketing and salesâ€”letting people know about your product and getting them to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.
2.  **Delivery**: Creating and providing the product or service, including design, distribution, customer success, and onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
3.  **Operations**: Everything else that supports acquisition and delivery, such as legal, finance, payroll, HR, and recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

For a business to scale effectively, it must be balanced across these three pillars. Partnerships should complement missing skills or provide necessary capital, ensuring all legs of the stool are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. If a partnership over-indexes on one pillar (e.g., two marketing experts), the business becomes top-heavy and unstable, hindering [[challenges_and_lessons_in_scaling_business_operations | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

## Sustaining Growth and Improvement
Once a business is growing, the key is to expand the gap between you and competitors by continuously building on your [[role_of_leverage_and_efficiency_in_scaling_a_business | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

### Compounding and Focus
The concept of compounding, often referred to as the "eighth wonder of the world," applies directly to business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. The objective is to never interrupt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Ruthless focus over long periods is crucial for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. Focus is defined by the quality and quantity of things you say "no" to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.

Entrepreneurs often fall into the trap of restarting their efforts when faced with the "valley of despair" in one venture, chasing new "uninformed optimism" in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. This disrupts compounding and prevents long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. True success often comes from concentrating all efforts into one basket until significant success is achieved, *then* diversifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

### Continuous Learning Loop
To [[challenges_and_lessons_in_scaling_a_business | get better]] and sustain growth, a continuous learning loop is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Volume**: Generating a lot of data through consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Common Factors Analysis**: Analyzing the data to identify what works (top 10%) versus what doesn't (bottom 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This helps in acquiring new skills, refining strategies, and understanding customer avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.

This feedback loop of effort and analysis forces continuous improvement, allowing you to discover more efficient ways to apply your leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The pursuit of larger goals is not just about the money, but about the personal growth and transformation required to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. Business, like life, is an infinite game where the objective is to stay in business and continue becoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

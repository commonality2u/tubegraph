Building a successful business relies not just on hard work, but on strategic decision-making and leveraging opportunities. As recounted by Warren Buffett, a single decision can dramatically alter life outcomes, emphasizing that it's "not as important how hard you row, but what boat you are in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This perspective highlights the critical importance of selecting the right [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | opportunities]] and applying effective [[frameworks_and_lessons_in_building_successful_businesses | frameworks]] for [[Business Growth and Scaling Strategies | business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Understanding Level 7 Entrepreneurship
The concept of "Level 7 Entrepreneurship" involves viewing businesses as products that increase personal net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's about assessing and appraising opportunity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While the speaker describes himself as a "Level 7 entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, he admits feeling more like someone taking "a couple steps forward and one toe after the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Early Observations of a Level 7 Entrepreneur
The speaker shares several observations on wealth and the entrepreneurial journey:
*   Everyone wants you to do well, "just not better than them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   "No one actually wants you to be rich except for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Money solves only money problems, leaving you with problems money can't solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   You don't "arrive"; you just enter a new club as the smallest member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Passive income can be overrated; engaging activities and options are often more fulfilling than pure freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Foundation of Success: Time Allocation
The core premise for achieving material success is that "time allocation is the only thing that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Mastering time means mastering material success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Speed in business comes not from constant activity, but from making the right strategic decisions and minimizing mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

> "90% of success can be boiled down to consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

### The Multiplier on Time: Leverage
The key multiplier on time is [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The size of opportunities pursued is directly proportional to the amount of leverage that can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. "Rich dads" encourage high-leverage opportunities like real estate, funds, or business ownership, while "poor dads" suggest low-leverage paths, forcing their kids to learn the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

It's "harder to build a small business than a big business" because top talent is attracted to big opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Small goals and big goals are equally difficult in terms of time commitment, so it's better to aim big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Four Frameworks for Applying Leverage
These frameworks are used for investing in portfolio companies and scaling existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### 1. Scale the Entrepreneur
Every business is bottlenecked by the entrepreneur in one of three ways:
*   **Lack a Skill** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>
*   **Lack a Character Trait** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>
*   **Lack a Belief** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>

> "If any side of that ladder is missing, no matter how developed the other components, you will be limited to the lowest rung." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>

Examples of deficiencies:
*   **Trait Deficiency (Focus)**: Having too many businesses (e.g., 10 businesses with no money) due to the "niche slapping fallacy," where one believes pursuing all options will lead to one succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Focus is crucial; competing against those with one single focus puts you at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Belief Deficiency (Opportunity Scale)**: Believing that running multiple gyms is the path to scale, rather than teaching others your model. The insight from Russell Brunson was that the speaker had a "level 10 skill set in a level two opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, leading to a pivot from gym owner to licensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Skill Deficiency (Sales Management)**: Complaints like "no good sales people exist" or "my sales team is inconsistent" are skill deficiencies in recruiting, interviewing, training, and managing high-performance sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Skills exist on a continuum, not as binaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

Improving skills comes from "repetition and feedback, aka volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Conviction comes from having done something so many times you're bored of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The biggest deficiency for many is unrealistic expectations (e.g., becoming a millionaire in 90 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. "I'd rather get rich for sure than get rich quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

Skills, traits, and beliefs all compound, yielding "crazy outside returns seemingly overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Skill Stacking Example (Financial)**: Good at math -> Bookkeeping -> Accounting degree -> Tax strategy -> Insurance -> Negotiate deal structure -> Mastery of capital markets (Rainmaker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **Skill Stacking Example (Speaker's)**: Get in shape/work out -> Nutrition -> Sell -> Market locally -> Operate (scaled to 6 locations) -> Scale sales teams -> Market B2B nationally. This stack led to rapid growth (0 to $28M/year in 20 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### 2. Scale the Market
Picking the right market is crucial. A "starving crowd" is the most valuable competitive advantage, regardless of other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

Four attributes of a good market:
*   **Pain**: They desperately need what you sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Able to Afford**: They have the financial capacity to buy your service/product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Easy to Target (Tactical)**: The audience is identifiable and reachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Growing**: The market is expanding, providing a tailwind for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

Five ways to scale an existing market:
1.  **Up Market**: Target larger entities (e.g., multi-location owners, chains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
2.  **Down Market**: Target individuals who will eventually become your ideal customer (e.g., hair stylists for salon owners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
3.  **Adjacent Market**: Target similar customer bases with core desires (e.g., lashes and nails for salon owners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
4.  **Broader**: Expand to a wider range of related services (e.g., med spas, massage for salons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
5.  **Deeper**: Maximize existing market penetration (e.g., acquire competitors, use new platforms, increase ad budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. "Do the boring work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### 3. Scale the Deliverable
This framework acts as an "opportunity lens" for any venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

The Four C's to Leverage:
1.  **Labor**: Traditional leverage, but requires permission (paying people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.
2.  **Capital**: Higher leverage, used by billionaires like Buffett and Munger, also requires permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
3.  **Code**: Permissionless leverage; software can be duplicated infinitely at no cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
4.  **Content/Media**: Permissionless leverage; zero cost of replication, like a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
The new fortunes are built with permissionless leverage (Code and Content/Media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, and the top performers use all four (Labor, Capital, Code, Content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

The speaker's own trajectory demonstrates jumps in leverage:
*   Employee (someone else's labor) -> 4 figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>
*   Trainer (own labor) -> 5 figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>
*   Gym Owner (leveraging labor) -> 6 figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>
*   Licensor (labor + media) -> $1M/month income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>
*   Acquisition (labor + media + capital) -> Aiming for 8 figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>
*   Full stack (all four) -> Aiming for 9 figures/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>

The **Delivery Cube** offers variables to optimize product/service delivery and profit:
*   **Setting**: One-on-one, small group, or one-to-many (adjust pricing accordingly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   **Involvement**: Do-it-yourself (DIY), Done-with-you, or Done-for-you solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
*   **Support Level**: Tech, chat, email, phone, or Zoom support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Consumption**: Written, live, audio, or video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Speed & Convenience**: 24/7, 9-5, specific response times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Value vs. Price Thought Experiments**:
    *   10x the price: What would you deliver? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>
    *   1/10 the price: What else would you build that costs nothing to replicate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>
    *   If marketing stopped: How different would your client experience be if new customers only came from referrals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>

Six "base chunks" you can sell:
*   Products (physical/digital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>
*   Services (physical/digital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>
*   Access (physical/digital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>
*   Media (physical/digital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>
*   Risk (physical/digital, e.g., insurance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>
*   Money (physical/digital, e.g., cryptocurrency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>

### 4. Scale the Business
This framework outlines what to focus on at different revenue levels for [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | scaling business operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>:

*   **0-1 Million Revenue**:
    *   **Objective**: Consistently sell something people actually want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
    *   **Focus**: One product, one avatar, one channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: Not knowing what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

*   **1-10 Million Revenue**:
    *   **Objective**: Increase lifetime gross profit per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: Not making enough take-home profit to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: Add higher leverage deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

*   **10-50 Million Revenue**:
    *   **Objective**: Professionalize the business and ensure consistent delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: Inconsistent delivery, poor tracking, messy finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: Hire high-level, experienced talent who have scaled before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

*   **50 Million+ Revenue (Framework X)**:
    *   **Objective**: Attract talent to drive growth and new revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
    *   **Problem**: Innovation dies due to one entrepreneur's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: Business becomes a conglomeration of many businesses with incentivized "stallions" (CEOs) running their own P&Ls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

The speaker highlights the importance of internal business functions mirroring external metrics (e.g., tracking applications and interviews for hiring, not just sales calls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. Often, a business is "one amazing hire away from all the growth you ever wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.

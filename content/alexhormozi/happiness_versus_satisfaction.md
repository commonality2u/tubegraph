True [[happiness_and_meaning_in_life|happiness]] can exist even before reaching a goal, but satisfaction should be reserved for what comes after the goal is achieved. The distinction lies in the difference between being content with one's life and work, and being complacent, which implies a halt in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01"></a>.

## The Pursuit of Progress

The speaker highlights a Haitian proverb: "Behind mountains are more mountains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18"></a>. This illustrates that after reaching one peak, more peaks always lie ahead, signifying a continuous journey of growth. This perspective implies that the work itself, rather than just its outcome, is the ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43"></a>.

The speaker's personal experience of a year in "retirement" led to the realization that [[identifying_meaningful_work_and_its_impact_on_wellbeing|hard work is the goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35"></a>. The positive results of hard work are seen as a secondary effect or consequence, not the primary objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41"></a>. Not working led to boredom and depression, while working, despite stress, provided enjoyable moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53"></a>.

This perspective suggests that "misery exists on both sides," whether one is working or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06"></a>. Therefore, to be productive and [[the_concept_of_usefulness_and_value_in_personal_fulfillment|useful]], one should be happy with the process but never satisfied, ensuring a continuous drive to provide value to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08"></a>. This philosophy implies that the pursuit of [[pain_and_progress|progress]] inherently involves discomfort, and that an [[obsession_with_happiness_and_its_consequences|easy life]] is incompatible with significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57"></a>.

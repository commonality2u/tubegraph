Running paid advertisements is presented as the fourth method in the "Core 4" for acquiring customers, specifically for reaching people who do not know you on a one-to-many basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. This method is considered the fastest and most risky, but if done well, it can generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. The speaker shares that the majority of his net worth has been generated through running paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

## How Paid Ads Work
Paid advertising involves paying a platform to gain access to strangers within their newsfeed, whether it's on television, Instagram, or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Ads are typically inserted between the free content that users are consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

## Structure of an Effective Paid Ad
A paid ad generally consists of three main parts, similar to the "Hook, Retain, Reward" framework for free content, but with a crucial difference: the inclusion of a clear call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>:

1.  **Hook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>: This is the most critical part, as 80% of people decide not to watch an ad within the first three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Effective hooks grab attention and create curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
    *   **Call Out**: Often precedes the hook to target a specific audience (avatar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This can be:
        *   **Visual**: Something viewers see that indicates the ad is for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
        *   **Auditory**: Directly addressing the target audience (e.g., "Las Vegas homeowners") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
    *   **Question-based Hooks**: Using questions like "Are you backed up in trash?" or "Does the smell of your trash drive you bananas?" can immediately engage the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
    *   **Relatable Moments**: Presenting scenarios that the target audience has experienced, such as "Alex, did you take the trash out? I'm watching the game on my phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
    *   **Humor**: Incorporating humor can make ads more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
    *   **Visual Cues**: Using specific visuals can create curiosity and act as a filtering mechanism to attract the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
2.  **Meat/Retain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>: This section presents and agitates the problem the audience faces, describing the pain points in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
    *   **Agitating Pain**: The more detailed the description of the pain points, the more the audience will feel affected (e.g., the smell of trash, chasing the truck, trash piling up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. It's important to hit multiple pain points as different ones resonate with different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
    *   **Presenting Solutions/Benefits**: Clearly outline how the service or product solves these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Presenting benefits in groups (e.g., "three things") helps organize information for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
    *   **Guarantees**: Placing guarantees within the ad can build trust and highlight exceptional offers (e.g., "three free months if we miss one pickup day") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
3.  **Call to Action (CTA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>: This prompts the viewer to take a specific action, such as clicking a link or calling a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

### Key Considerations for [[Effective Ad Creation and Optimization Techniques]]
*   **Targeting (`role_of_ad_targeting_in_business_success`)**: When spending money to reach eyeballs, ensure the ad communicates who it's for, so only the specific type of person you want to respond does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Avatar Representation**: The setting and the avatar (person) in the ad will do more to attract the right types of people than anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. To double or triple reach, include two, three, or four different people in your ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Testing**: The hook is the most important part of an ad to test frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Offer**: A superior or "big fast value" offer is crucial, especially when talking to strangers, as they don't trust you and need a big incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This is a significant [[methods_for_advertising_and_generating_business_leads | force multiplier]] for getting people to say yes on cold outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

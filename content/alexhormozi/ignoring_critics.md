Ignoring critics, while easy to say, can be challenging to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. However, it is a crucial truth for achieving an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding Critics

Most people are "fat, poor pansies" and will attempt to deter you from succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The average person's goal is to keep you average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. If you aspire to be extraordinary, you will naturally engage in actions that an ordinary person would deem "extra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

A difficult truth to accept is that many people desire your failure, as it validates their choice not to take risks themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Who to Listen To

Always prioritize listening to individuals who are closest to your goals, rather than those who are merely closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Ultimately, your critics will pass away, and their opinions will cease to matter, rendering them irrelevant even now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Envy Versus Effort

The amount of mental energy people expend on hatred and envy for others' achievements, if redirected towards their own goals, would already lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

Consider these hard truths:
*   No one is performing as well as you perceive them to be; by comparison, you are often better off than you think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   Victory is not achieved by defeating others, but by realizing your own potential and consequently rendering others irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   Your greatest threat is not your [[competition_and_handling_criticism | competition]], but a mediocre version of yourself that never achieves its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

It is ironic that the businesses most copied by their [[competition_and_handling_criticism | competition]] are those that ignore their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Success stems from focusing on the customer; if you prioritize the customer, others will naturally emulate you because you are doing what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. The actual threat is that no one copies you at all, indicating you are doing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

Instead of comparing yourself to others or mentally tearing them down, channel that energy into self-improvement. Only one of these actions will genuinely help you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

## Don't Give Away Your Power

What offends you ultimately controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. Whatever you blame also holds power over your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. Using excuses like "I can't do it because X" means that X has power over your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

Even if your excuses are valid, they are still your problem, and you must act on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. Waiting to live the life you desire until you die, merely to validate an excuse, is not a worthwhile goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. Excuses are fundamentally a "permission slip for mediocrity," seeking respect without the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. However, only you truly believe your excuses; while loved ones may indulge you, you will not earn genuine respect, especially not your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>. You will always know you could have done more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

### The Voice of Judgment
The crucial step is identifying whose voice or judgment you fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:00">[32:47:00]</a>. Often, it's just a couple of specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>. Giving someone power over your life by allowing their potential negative opinion to dictate your decisions is a terrible reason not to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.

Even if you achieve success, people who don't want you to win will find justifications to disqualify your earned respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. They might attribute your success to genetics, parents, inherited wealth, connections, or demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>. Providing them with these justifications does not benefit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>.

Do not choose to prove everyone wrong by wasting any advantages you may have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>. Play the cards you are dealt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. People will attempt to disqualify your success regardless, because it makes *them* uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

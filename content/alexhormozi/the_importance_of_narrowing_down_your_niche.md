This guide outlines a framework for starting a business, focusing on identifying your "what" (business idea), "who" (target audience), and "how" (solution delivery and messaging) to effectively serve your first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process aims to help you find your "best bad idea" quickly, allowing for iteration and refinement over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## The "What": Identifying Your Business Idea
Businesses are often born from one of three "Ps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

1.  **Pain**: Something you personally experienced and overcame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. An example is a mother of nine who developed a system for preparing daily lunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  **Profession**: Your current or past day job skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A registered dietitian, for instance, learned to quickly bill insurance at a hospital and then taught others how to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Solving one very specific problem can form the basis of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Any professional skill can be leveraged for consulting or teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
3.  **Passion**: Topics you are inherently interested in, such as articles you read or podcasts you listen to in your spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The speaker's personal interest in fitness led to friends suggesting he start a gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

It's important not to worry about picking the perfect idea on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The act of picking a "best bad idea" begins the iteration process through customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The "Who": Defining Your Target Audience
Once you have a "what," the next step is defining your "who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. There are three categories for identifying your target audience:

1.  **People Like You**: Those who share a problem you have overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This approach often leads to "missionary" businesses, where you genuinely care about delivering an exceptional product because you understand their pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
2.  **People You've Helped Before**: This could be for money or as a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The speaker's first paid interaction was helping a gym acquaintance with her food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
3.  **Underserved Markets**: Identifying growing markets with unmet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. While more formal, most heart- and mind-driven businesses stem from the first two categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Narrowing Down Your Avatar
To get really clear on your target audience, think of it as having five frames to narrow down your "avatar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:
*   Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Problems/Pains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
*   Interests/Passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

You should pick at least three of these to create a specific enough description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. For example, "35-year-old male accountants who are bored at their jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The goal is to describe the person so precisely that they know you're talking to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### The Power of Specificity
It's a common misconception that [[niche_market_targeting_and_expansion_strategies | narrowing your niche]] limits your earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In reality, the more specific you get, the more you can charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

For instance, a broad "time management" product might sell for $19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. But a product for "time management for outbound salespeople" could be $199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, and "the entire outbound time management system for garden and power tools" could command $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. When you are the best and only solution for a highly specific niche, you operate in a "blue ocean" with minimal competition, allowing you to set premium prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The "How": Describing Your Solution
The "how" involves two parts:

### How Part One: The Upside (Good Stuff)
Describe all the positive outcomes and experiences your solution helps them achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Consider:
*   How much easier their lives will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   How guaranteed the outcome is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   How much faster they will get what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   How it would feel to experience their dream scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
These four elements constitute the value equation, written positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### How Part Two: The Downside (Bad Stuff)
Describe the negative things your solution helps them avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This is the inverse of the upside, focusing on:
*   Risks you help them avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   Slowness they won't experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   Pain, sacrifice, and suffering they avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

A compelling message effectively describes both what the customer will gain and what they will avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The more specific you are about their pain, the more they will believe you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Gathering "How" Information
If your target audience is not "you," gather information by "asking people" through interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Ask questions like:
*   What problems are you struggling with? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>
*   How long have you struggled with them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
*   What makes it painful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>
*   Describe your ideal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   What good things do you normally have to give up? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>
*   What bad things do you normally have to start doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>

The answers to these questions will inform "how part one" (good stuff) and "how part two" (bad stuff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Putting It All Together: Your Core Message
Combine all elements into a simple sentence:
"I help [WHO] get [GOOD STUFF] without [BAD STUFF] through [UNIQUE MECHANISM (optional)]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Examples:
*   "I help 35-year-old male accountants get a new income stream without losing their current stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   "I help 45-year-old women who just had kids get back into their high school jeans without giving up time with their family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

This specific phrasing makes the person feel like you are directly addressing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Bonus: The Unique Mechanism
A unique mechanism differentiates your solution from competitors, even within a narrow niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. It's your "special sauce" or proprietary process that makes prospects feel like they've found the missing piece to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Your unique mechanism can be:
*   A list of things someone has to do to achieve a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   A series of steps to follow in sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Naming this proprietary process makes it your unique mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Examples include P90X's "muscle confusion" or Weight Watchers' "point system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This mechanism acts as the "vehicle" to take clients from their current state to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## Getting Your First Five Customers
To get your first five customers, use this simple warm outreach system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>:
1.  Greet someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  Mention something specific about them as a compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
3.  Insert the unique sentence you crafted ("I help who get good stuff without bad stuff...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
4.  Ask if they know anyone who could benefit from that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

Perform this process for four hours a day or until you reach 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Consistently applying this method will help you secure your initial customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

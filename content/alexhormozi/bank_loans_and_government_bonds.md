In 2022, a significant economic shift occurred, leading to changes in investment strategies, including moving cash out of traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Understanding what to do with cash while waiting to make investment moves is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Nature of Bank Deposits

When cash is deposited into a bank, it's essentially a loan made by the depositor to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This means the depositor becomes a creditor of the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. If the bank fails, they owe the depositor money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Any amount exceeding the FDIC insured limit can be lost if the bank goes bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## How Banks Utilize Deposits

Banks primarily use deposited money in two ways:
1.  **Purchasing Government Bonds**: Banks loan money to the government by buying bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The risk of the government not paying back is extremely low, as they have the ability to print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **Issuing Loans**: Banks also loan out money to individuals for things like mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Banks generate profit by lending money at a higher rate than they pay depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, banks might pay depositors between 0.1% and 1% annually on their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Meanwhile, they might lend this money to the government at a 4% annual return, earning 40 times more than they pay out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Risk and Return in Lending

When loaning money, two key factors are considered:
1.  **Interest Rate**: The return received on the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Likelihood of Repayment**: The probability of getting the money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Taking on higher risk typically means a higher potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The Alternative: U.S. Treasuries

An alternative to traditional bank accounts for holding cash is investing in U.S. Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These are viewed not as an investment vehicle but as a safer bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Why Treasuries?
*   **Lower Risk**: The U.S. government is considered less likely to go bankrupt than a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Higher Returns**: U.S. Treasuries often offer higher interest rates than typical bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Liquidity/Leverage**: Loans can be taken against Treasuries for up to 80% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This allows investors to maintain interest earnings while deploying capital elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Banks generally do not publicize this option because it reduces their profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

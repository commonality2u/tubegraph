Business growth is fundamentally composed of three components: the entrepreneur's [[role_of_skills_and_beliefs_in_entrepreneurial_growth | skills]], character traits, and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many individuals may add "potential" to their business without actually growing it because they fail to address the core constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. According to the theory of constraint, a system will only grow to its bottleneck and no further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Often, this bottleneck lies within the entrepreneur's character traits or limiting beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Identifying Limiting Character Traits

A significant barrier to growth can be the "I am" statements individuals make about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. These statements are powerful because they embed deeply held beliefs about one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Examples of limiting "I am" statements include:
*   "We are high anxiety people" or "we have lots of anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   "I'm an all or nothing type person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   "I used to tell people that I was bad at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   "I have a short fuse" or "I have a temper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   "I am disorganized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>
*   "I am not good with time" or "I am not good with money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>

Such statements can prevent growth if they do not serve the individual's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. To overcome this, one's identity "must be whatever is required to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Instead of definitive "I am" statements, language should shift towards:
*   "I have a tendency based on external circumstances to be more assertive in these types of conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   "I have a tendency towards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   "I have a proclivity for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
*   "I struggle with behaviors that are this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

Changing the way one speaks can change the way one thinks and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## The Danger of Crutches and Superstitions

Another significant limiting factor is an over-reliance on "crutches" and "superstitions" â€“ routines or dependencies that individuals believe are necessary for their functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While routines can be beneficial, becoming dependent on them can actually make an individual weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Examples of crutches:
*   Needing alcohol or drugs to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>
*   Needing coffee in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
*   Adherence to specific "weird rituals" or "pharmaceutical drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

This dependency can lead to a state where the crutch is needed just to feel "normal," rather than providing a benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For true benefit, activities should be cycled to maintain novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The weakness created by these dependencies makes one non-resilient; if the routine is interrupted, productivity and well-being suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. An ideal entrepreneur should be able to succeed "independent of circumstance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, much like Rocky Balboa's raw training contrasted with Drago's scientific dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

By eliminating these self-imposed weaknesses, entrepreneurs can become more resilient and effective in the competitive world of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, enabling them to build large enterprises and make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

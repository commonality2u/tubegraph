Starting four businesses that each surpassed $10 million in revenue provided a wealth of [[Frameworks for business scaling and success | frameworks]] and lessons, many learned from early mistakes that ultimately led to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Gym Launch: Scaling a Licensing Model

The first major company built was Gym Launch, a licensing business for gym owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This model allowed gym owners to adopt a proven system, significantly increasing their profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. At its peak, the business was valued at approximately $150 million, later selling for $46.2 million after being impacted by COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Initial Customer Acquisition Challenges
Early customer acquisition for Gym Launch involved labor-intensive methods:
*   Scraping CrossFit's database for emails via a VA in the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Uploading emails to Facebook to create lookalike audiences for webinar marketing, which initially had low engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Manually finding and messaging opt-in leads on Facebook to schedule calls, leading to the first few customers paying $500 for on-site gym turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Key Factors for [[Scaling business operations and managing growth | Scaling]]
The shift to a licensing model provided significant [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | leverage]] due to virtually 100% margins on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Sales rapidly grew, reaching $120,000 in the first month, then $300,000, and soon over $1 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

A core strategy was to identify and solve common problems faced by gym owners, such as churn, margin issues, or low lead close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This involved:
*   Creating hypotheses for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Surveying the community to find high-performing members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   Inviting top performers for calls to identify common successful practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Focusing on the few critical actions that provided significant, long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

#### Product Excellence and Word-of-Mouth
Exceptional product quality, though taking six years to develop, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The return on investment from word-of-mouth referrals was immense and compounded over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

#### Client-Financed Acquisition
A unique [[Business Growth and Scaling Strategies | customer acquisition model]] called "client-financed acquisition" was employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This means customers fund the acquisition of subsequent customers, eliminating capital as a constraint for [[scaling_business_operations_and_managing_growth | business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. By making more from the first sale than the cost to acquire and fulfill that customer (plus the next), a dollar in could generate multiple customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This allowed the business to outspend competitors on acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Operational Challenges
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic:** A significant challenge, leading to a third of clients going out of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Over-Hiring in Support:** An inexperienced director of customer service over-hired, leading to 30 layoffs and a negative impact on Glassdoor reviews for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Success Factors
*   **Timing:** Identifying an arbitrage opportunity on Facebook ads before competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Turnkey System:** Creating a system to monetize this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **High Customer ROI:** The average gym gained an additional $30,000 in cash within their first 30 days of using the system, effectively making marketing unnecessary due to the strong results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Prestige Labs: A Sister Company's [[Challenges and lessons in scaling a business | Scaling]] Journey

Prestige Labs was developed as a sister company to Gym Launch, leveraging its existing affiliate base of gym owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Its first month of full operation generated $1.7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | Leveraging]] Existing Distribution
The client-financed acquisition model was adapted for Prestige Labs: gym owners would sell supplements, covering their customer acquisition costs from the physical product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A key benefit was that selling physical products added no additional fulfillment burden for the gym owners, as shipping was managed centrally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The brand was exclusive to gym owners, priced higher on the main site to offer significant savings through the gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. A strong selling system and recurring subscriptions were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Initial rollout was staggered, starting with 10 locations, then expanding incrementally before a wider launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This approach created a unique market moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Investment and Obstacles
Starting Prestige Labs cost $4 million, with $1 million dedicated to proprietary tech for a gym-specific point-of-sale system (including a retail kit, kiosk, and iPad integration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The remaining $3 million was invested in product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

Major difficulties included:
*   **Supply Chain Issues:** Running out of a single ingredient could halt sales of an entire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Legal Challenges:** Predatory law firms actively sought to test products for discrepancies or infringements, leveraging patents for lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Customer Stickiness:** Low retention rates due to general lack of long-term adherence to fitness programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Lesson Learned: Focus on Core Business
The biggest lesson was that pursuing Prestige Labs likely detracted from Gym Launch's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Becoming CEO of two companies instead of focusing solely on one led to a slowdown in Gym Launch's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Allen.com: Software [[Scaling business operations and managing growth | Scaling]] with AI

Allen.com, still operational, was built to solve the problem of converting leads to appointments, especially for small businesses with in-person services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. By aggregating data on scheduling, the platform could predictably optimize show-up rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This expertise in lead throughput later benefited other portfolio companies, increasing ad throughput by 20-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Initial Problem and Solution
Initially, Allen solved a problem for gym owners, where only 9% of leads were converted manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Allen automated this, achieving nearly 20% lead conversion without manual effort, at a fraction of the cost of a front desk person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Shifting the [[Scaling a service-based business | Scaling]] Strategy
Sales began by leveraging the existing distribution base, but it became clear that expanding beyond this base was difficult as small businesses often lacked lead generation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

The breakthrough was realizing the need to target agencies rather than directly selling to small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Agencies provided greater [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | leverage]], as one agency could represent 50 small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Further [[Leverage and scaling in business growth | scaling]] was achieved by conducting webinars with large agency audiences, enabling a single pitch to acquire thousands of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This strategy led to $1.7 million per month in revenue within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Lessons Learned in Software Development and Pricing
Allen.com provided significant lessons:
1.  **In-House CTO:** Essential for software companies. Using external development shops (which are described as "close to a complete scam") is a mistake, akin to white-labeling core business delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Pricing Surveys:** Conduct pricing surveys early to unlock pricing power. Allen increased pricing by four times by repackaging how it charged, exploring usage-based, recurring, and API-based fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
3.  **Aligned Incentives:** Aligning incentives with customers generates more revenue and facilitates [[Business Growth and Scaling Strategies | growth]]. For Allen, the business owner, agency, and the company were all incentivized by increased show-up rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
4.  **Throughput on Appointments:** Maximizing availability (days, hours, time increments) for scheduling sales calls or in-person appointments is critical for lead conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Businesses with limited availability see significantly lower show-up rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Small business owners often make "small business owner decisions" that hinder their [[Scaling business operations and managing growth | scaling]] potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Acquisition.com: [[Scaling the unscalable in business | Scaling]] through Content and Talent

Acquisition.com, the fourth business, is a portfolio of companies doing over $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This business was uniquely built on a personal brand and inbound content strategy, unlike previous transactional models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### [[The role of leadership in scaling a business | Leadership]] and Learning
The core purpose is learning by being exposed to diverse businesses at a high level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Co-owning businesses allows for cross-pollination of ideas and strategies across industries for outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Hiring Top-Down for [[Scaling business operations and managing growth | Growth]]
A significant factor in Acquisition.com's rapid growth was hiring from the top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This contrasts with previous businesses where hiring was bottom-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Hiring highly skilled directors (e.g., sales, marketing, people, IT, portfolio operations) who are better than the founders allows for automatic delegation and accelerates progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

This top-down hiring approach requires strong capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Businesses accrue debt (financial, management, cultural, technical); choosing to incur financial debt (by hiring top talent early) can accelerate growth and avoid other types of debt in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Core Competency: Talent Recruitment
Acquisition.com has made talent recruitment its single core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. They excel at this due to:
*   High inbound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   The prestige of being a private equity firm, attracting higher-caliber talent than individual portfolio companies might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   In-house training on their business methods for new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   Offering direct support from their own directors to managers and directors within portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the biggest cost in business is "ignorance debt" – what is not known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. By partnering with businesses, Acquisition.com aims to accelerate their growth by leveraging their expertise and track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

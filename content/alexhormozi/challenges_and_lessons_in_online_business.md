This article details the journey of making the first $10,000 online, focusing on the strategies used to acquire the first 10 customers, what worked well, and what mistakes were made, providing valuable insights for aspiring entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of an Online Fitness Business

The speaker's journey began with a lifelong passion for fitness, cultivated from a young age through lifting weights and participating in a powerlifting team in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Even during a consulting job, fitness remained a constant topic of discussion, leading colleagues to encourage him to pursue it professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This inspiration led to the creation of "The Free Training Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The pivotal moment came when a woman at the gym, Sandy Smith, asked for help with her food after observing the speaker's fitness prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. After an hour and a half conversation at a pizza shop, she wrote a $100 check, a "clown check," which was a light bulb moment, realizing that making money from his passion was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Four Stages to First Customers

The process of acquiring the first customers involved four distinct stages:

### Stage 1: Homies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
The first step was to reach out to people who already knew and liked him, primarily friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Using his phone contacts, he secured about six friends who agreed to be trained for free in exchange for before and after pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This was crucial for gathering proof, testimonials, and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that proof is more important than an amazing offer, as people need to believe the service will work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These initial clients had diverse goals, including weight loss (50 lbs for one guy and one girl) and body recomposition, providing a range of testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This stage took approximately six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Stage 2: Referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
After getting results for the initial "homies," the next step was to ask them for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Referrals are considered the most important marketing tool because:
*   They are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   They have a higher likelihood of buying at higher prices, indicating a higher conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   People who come from referrals are more likely to refer others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   A lack of referrals indicates that the service might not be good enough yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This stage yielded 6 to 10 more referrals, but a challenge emerged: since the service was still free, these new clients often didn't commit or take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

### Stage 3: The Free Training Project (with Donation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>
To address the lack of commitment, the "Free Training Project" evolved. Referrals were now asked to donate $500 to $1,000 to a charity of their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This ensured clients had "skin in the game" without directly paying the trainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The charitable aspect also attracted more support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This phase provided the necessary experience and testimonials to transition to a fully paid model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### Stage 4: Skinny to Swole Project (Monetization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>
A year after starting, the speaker launched the "Skinny to Swole Project," charging new clients $200 a month for 12 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. All the transformation pictures from the previous stages were used as powerful social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Critically, clients from the free training project were successfully transitioned into the paid program by reframing their past charity donations as effectively paying for the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This marked overcoming the fear of charging for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

The speaker acquired 20 clients for the "Skinny to Swole" project, generating $4,000 per month, totaling $12,000 over the 12-week program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The initial content post announcing the official launch of the business, leveraging existing fitness-related content and testimonials, was key to attracting these first paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## What I Would Have Done Differently

### The Rule of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
For beginners, an online service business is recommended due to low startup costs, minimal overhead, flexibility, and the opportunity to learn mistakes in a low-stakes environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

The speaker recommends a strategy called "The Rule of 300," which is an expansion of the "Rule of 100" (found in his "$100M Leads" book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The Rule of 100 involves:
*   100 warm outreaches (to people who know you, e.g., contacts, social media followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   100 cold outreaches (to people who don't know you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   100 minutes making content daily and posting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Spending at least $100 a day on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The "Rule of 300" breaks down the warm outreach component into three tactical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
1.  **Post Content:** Make one post on one platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
2.  **100 Comments:** Engage by leaving 100 thoughtful comments, ideally within a relevant group or community. This strategy helps stand out and piggyback on other people's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
3.  **One-on-One Outreach to "Lukewarm" Leads:** Target people who have shown interest (liked your post, commented on your post, liked your comments, or replied to your comments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. These individuals have taken an action that indicates interest, making them engaged leads ready for a direct conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

This strategy requires time, potentially two to four hours daily, but is crucial for building an audience from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Key Lessons Learned ([[frameworks_and_lessons_in_building_successful_businesses|What Worked Well]])

The speaker shares significant [[challenges_and_lessons_in_scaling_a_business|lessons]] learned from this initial venture:

### Walk the Walk: Proof Over Promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>
It's essential to embody what you sell. If you're selling weight loss, you should be in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Being a "walking billboard" for your service answers obvious objections and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. While a strong promise is good, **proof** of results (for yourself and others) is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Live Cheap and Save Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>
Living frugally (e.g., spending $1,200/month while earning a consultant's income) allows for saving a financial runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. With $50,000 saved, the speaker had two to three years of runway, providing the security needed to quit his job and go all-in on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Saving money doesn't make money directly but enables taking bigger risks and longer time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The "hack" for saving money is to work more, which not only earns money but also reduces time available for spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

### Start Free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>
Starting free helps gather essential proof, testimonials, feedback, and referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. These non-monetary compensations are often worth more than the initial cash payment they could have made, as they can be "cashed in later for money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The speaker adopts Chick-fil-A's pricing philosophy: either full price or free, with no discounting, to maintain perceived value and avoid negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

### Templated One-to-Many Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>
Investing time upfront in building a scalable solution (e.g., an Excel sheet to generate customized meal plans and grocery lists in minutes) allowed for delivering high value with minimal ongoing effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This "free period" is ideal for building systems that address common questions and streamline processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Niching down (e.g., "skinny to swole" for men) further enhances this, as solutions become more templated, costing less to deliver while providing more specific and deeper value to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

### Recurring Business Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>
Starting with a recurring revenue model (like fitness coaching) naturally provides month-after-month income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Mistakes Made ([[overcoming_initial_setbacks_in_entrepreneurship|What Didn't Work]])

The speaker also highlights crucial [[challenges_of_becoming_successful|mistakes]] made in the early stages:

### Not Ascending Clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>
A significant mistake was not having a second offer or a way for clients to continue paying after their initial 12-week program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. The solution is simple: offer them more of what they just bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

### Stopping for "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>
Despite building a profitable online business making $4,000/month working only four hours a week, the speaker stopped to pursue a new venture (a brick-and-mortar gym) because he perceived the online business as "not legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. This highlights the danger of abandoning a successful model for something entirely new without fully scaling the existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### No Good Offer or Sales Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>
Initially, there was no structured offer or sales process; links were simply sent for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Not getting on the phone with potential clients meant undercharging for personalized services ($200/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. A well-defined offer and sales process allow for higher pricing and greater profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

### Judgment and External Validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>
Major life decisions were made based on the perceived judgment of others (classmates, family) who weren't even thinking about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This external validation seeking kept him "poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

### Not Getting Help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>
The speaker did everything solo in the beginning, which significantly prolonged his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. Seeking help and learning from others dramatically increased his income later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

## General Advice for Entrepreneurs

The speaker offers 13 pieces of advice for those starting out, based on his experience and observations from thousands of successful communities:

1.  **Follow Instructions:** Adhere to proven strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
2.  **Google First:** Before asking for help, try to find the answer yourself. This develops problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
3.  **Post What You Figure Out:** Share your learnings within a community to add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
4.  **Actually Follow the Rule of 100 Daily:** Consistency is key. Inconsistent inputs lead to inconsistent outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
5.  **Work Begins When Excitement Ends:** Initial excitement will fade; the real work starts when you have to confront discomfort and tasks you don't know how to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
6.  **Your Work Works On You More Than You Work On It:** You are the primary product being built. Even seemingly futile tasks (like digging and refilling holes) become self-care if viewed as personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
7.  **Everything is Unscalable in the Beginning; That's the Point:** This initial, hands-on phase is how you master every aspect of your business. Pain points force you to seek improvements and gain leverage (skills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
8.  **The Pain of Repetition is What Forces You to Seek Improvement:** Monotony drives innovation in your process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
9.  **If You Complain, You Are Dead to Me:** Complaining expends effort without result and is often a bid for attention or pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. "It is better to be envied than pitied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
10. **Literally Thousands of People Have Succeeded; You Are Not Special:** Repeat the actions of successful people to achieve similar outcomes. If results differ, it means an unidentified variable exists, not that the process doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
11. **Write Down Every Reason You're Going to Stick With It:** Motivation fades. Have a "big bag of whys" – both what you're running towards and what you're running away from (e.g., hating being broke) – to revisit during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
12. **Business is Shockingly Simple, But Surprisingly Hard:** The simplicity lies in the core concepts (e.g., fitness: eat less, move more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. The difficulty comes from unwavering consistency, especially when immediate rewards are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Those who can work today for results years down the road are the "most potent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
13. **Just Win:** Success is addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. The pain endured to achieve a goal fades over time, but the achievement itself stays with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Understanding that "pain will pass but what I get for it will stay with me" is a major unlock in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

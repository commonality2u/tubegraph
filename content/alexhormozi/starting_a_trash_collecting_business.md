This article outlines how to start a trash collecting business, emphasizing customer acquisition strategies and leveraging initial services to build a sustainable model. The core principles discussed are applicable to various service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Core 4 Customer Acquisition Methods

To start a business and turn "trash into cash," the first step is to acquire customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The video outlines "The Core 4" methods for gaining customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 1. Warm Outreach (People You Know)

The easiest way to get customers is by talking to people you already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

*   **Initial Contact:** Pull up your phone contacts and find someone to call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Personalized Approach:** Start with a personalized tidbit, possibly found through social media pre-research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Direct Question:** Ask a direct question about the service you offer, e.g., "Is anyone taking out your trash?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The goal is to identify if they spend time on a task you can do for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Frame your service as "time-saving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Offer Free Service:** Offer to do the service for free for a few people (e.g., five or ten) to gain testimonials and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This allows you to practice and get feedback from "friendlies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition:** Emphasize that the client is "helping you out" by letting you perform the service for free, rather than you doing them a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Your time isn't valuable *yet* if you're not making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Outcomes from Free Service:** You can make money in four ways from offering a free service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, which contributes to [[building_a_sustainable_business_model | building a sustainable business model]]:
    1.  **Become a Customer:** They like the service and become paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    2.  **Leave a Review:** They don't become a customer but leave a valuable review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    3.  **Refer a Friend:** They send you a friend as a referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    4.  **Provide Feedback:** They offer feedback on how to improve, which can lead to long-term money making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Scripted Conversation:** Follow a script initially, as it helps when you don't know what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Over time, you'll find your own rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Getting Referrals (Three-Way Text Intro):** Ask if they know others who might benefit from your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Instead of asking them to remember to make an intro, ask for a three-way text introduction immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This directly provides leads and makes the new contact more polite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

**Limitations of Warm Outreach:**
*   **Time:** You have limited hours in a day to make calls and reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Network Size:** You only know so many people. Even with email lists, phone contacts, and social media followers, you can quickly exhaust your warm network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### 2. Posting Free Content

The second way to [[acquiring_customers_for_small_businesses | acquire customers]] is by posting free valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The goal is to provide so much value that your audience asks for more, either free content or paid services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

*   **Content Structure (Hook, Retain, Reward/Call to Action):**
    *   **Hook:** Capture attention in the first 3 seconds, as this is the most critical part of a content video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Hooks can be questions, jarring statements, or crazy topics that generate curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   **Retain:** Keep the audience engaged using lists, steps, stories, or a combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Use "open loops" (e.g., "Way number one...", then "Way number two...") to encourage viewers to watch to the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   **Reward/Call to Action:** The end of the content should encourage sharing (e.g., a funny moment that subverts audience expectations) or include a clear call to action (e.g., "Call 1800-Alex-Trash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy for Local Business:**
    *   **Consumer-focused:** Offer tips about trash that improve their lives, independent of using your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   **Recruitment-focused:** Target potential employees by showcasing what a sales or trash collecting job looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Content Tips:**
    *   **Remind More Than Teach:** People need to be reminded frequently. It's arrogant to assume your audience consumes all content or remembers it perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Re-use concepts across different formats (tweets, videos, captions, podcasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   **Leads from Engagement:** People who like, engage with, or comment on your posts are leads that you can message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Engagement gives you a reason to reach out without seeming like a "scumbag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
    *   **Reframe Views:** Instead of being discouraged by low view counts, imagine the number of views as the size of a room you're speaking in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Seventeen views is a full classroom, and reaching them for free is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### 3. Cold Outreach (Strangers One-on-One)

Cold outreach involves reaching out directly to strangers through various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This method requires learning how to sell and handle rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

*   **Methods:** Email, phone calls, direct messages, SMS, voicemails, or door-to-door sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Door-to-door is considered the most aggressive but builds immense respect and thick skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Preparation for Door-to-Door:**
    *   **Visual Cues:** Dress in work clothes and carry visual aids (like trash over your shoulder) to immediately demonstrate your service and create curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Existing Clients:** Use "name dropping" by mentioning you work with their neighbors (e.g., "the Johnsons") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This disarms the stranger, builds trust, and increases the likelihood they will give you time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Sales Script (for "no" vs. "yes" to existing service):**
    *   **Initial Question:** Ask if they already have someone providing the service, rather than directly asking if they want your service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. This allows you to guide the conversation regardless of their answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
    *   **If "No" (No existing provider):** Use a "no-based question" (e.g., "Would you be opposed to me doing it for you?") which statistically yields more "yes" responses than direct "yes-based questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Once they say yes, stop talking and get the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
    *   **If "Yes" (Has existing provider):**
        *   **Rapport Building:** Be friendly and upbeat. Use humor (e.g., "Are they as awesome and smiley as me?") to disarm and make them less likely to be rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
        *   **Alternative Offer:** Introduce a superior offer, such as a free trial period (e.g., "Do they also do it for free for this month?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. People who already pay for a service are more likely to buy from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
        *   **Close the Deal:** Ask for ID and credit card information to secure the payment details, holding onto their ID until they provide the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Handling Rejection:** "Noes" are like "coins that you toss in the machine" before you get a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Don't take it personally; a "no" from someone having a bad day has nothing to do with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. [[steps_to_achieve_first_online_business_success | Building a valuable business]] requires learning to sell and facing rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Solving Cold Outreach Problems:**
    1.  **No Contact Information:** Build a list using software, brokers, or by assembling it yourself (most valuable, as it's a "virgin list") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Sources include Yelp, Google Maps, online databases, Facebook groups, and Reddit forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
    2.  **What to Say (Script and Offer):** Use a script (like in *100 Million Leads*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a> and offer "Big Fast Value" (BFV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. A superior, amazing offer is crucial when talking to strangers who don't trust you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
    3.  **Not Enough Replies:** Increase **volume** of outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. This is achieved through automation and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Getting good at technology provides leverage for replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

### 4. Running Paid Ads

Paid advertising is the fastest and most risky method of customer acquisition, but can yield significant results if executed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. This involves paying platforms to access strangers and communicate to them one-to-many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

*   **Ad Structure (Hook, Meat/Retain, Call to Action):**
    *   **Hook:** Capture attention in the first few seconds, as 80% of people decide not to watch within 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. Test multiple hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. Hooks can be questions, statements, or visual cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
    *   **Call Out:** Before the hook, use a visual or auditory call-out to specify who the ad is for (e.g., "Las Vegas homeowners") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   **Meat (Problem & Solution):**
        *   **Present & Agitate the Pain:** Describe common pain points related to the service (e.g., trash smell, forgetting pickup days, chasing the truck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. Be detailed in describing the pain points to resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. Attack the problem from multiple angles (e.g., personal inconvenience, social status) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
        *   **Introduce Solutions/Benefits:** Present solutions in an organized manner (e.g., "three things we do better") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Include strong guarantees (e.g., "three free months if we miss one pickup day") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Elevate your service by addressing perceived weaknesses in the industry (e.g., professional and polite team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
    *   **Call to Action (CTA):** Clearly instruct viewers what to do next (e.g., "Click the link or call 1800-Alex-Trash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Ad Tips:**
    *   **Avatar Alignment:** The setting and the appearance of the person in the ad will attract the right type of customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
    *   **Diverse Representation:** To double or triple your reach, include multiple different types of people in your ads (e.g., more women in ads to attract more women clients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

For business owners and high-level employees, understanding and optimizing how time is spent can significantly impact a business's financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many individuals claim to work hard daily but struggle to define "work" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Traditional definitions, such as physics (force x distance) or time on the clock, are not useful for knowledge workers, as simply logging hours doesn't guarantee results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Similarly, effort alone (like participation trophies) doesn't measure actual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Defining Work and Output

Work should be defined by its outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The formula for work is:
*   **Work = Outputs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Outputs = Volume x Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
    *   **Volume** is the number of times you do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Leverage** is how much you get out of each time you do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

To work faster or do more work per unit of time, the equation becomes:
*   **Work per unit of time = (Volume x Leverage) / Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   In plain terms, this is output per unit of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The goal is to maximize output from the time invested, which in business translates to making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Many entrepreneurs, despite thinking they work hard, often fail to generate sufficient volume of high-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The Most Impactful Business Inputs

To grow a business, focus on two core strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:
1.  **Get more customers:**
    *   Increase traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> (e.g., advertise more/better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>).
    *   Improve conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> (e.g., practice sales, improve offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>).
2.  **Make existing customers worth more:**
    *   Raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   Decrease cost of goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   Increase customer retention/frequency of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> (e.g., improve onboarding, hold events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>).

For most small businesses, the primary focus should be on getting more traffic and improving conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. If you lack customers, other strategies are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Consistently performing these high-impact activities (e.g., 4 hours daily on advertising or sales practice) is crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Spending time on activities that don't directly contribute to these four areas is akin to doing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Understanding Your Time: Maker vs. Manager

Entrepreneurs typically engage in two distinct types of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>:

### [[maker_schedule_and_deep_work_importance | Maker Time]]
*   Consists of long, uninterrupted blocks, typically 4-6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   Highly valuable due to its scarcity (e.g., only 14 work blocks per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Characterized by low urgency and high importance work that moves the business forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   A productive maker calendar is often an empty one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, as interruptions can destroy an entire block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### [[the_manager_schedule_and_time_optimization | Manager Time]]
*   Involves smaller time blocks, often 5-15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Abundant (100+ blocks per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   The goal is to fill the calendar with these slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   Involves training teams, coordinating, communicating, and putting out fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### The Clash of Schedules
Both [[balancing_manager_and_maker_time_for_entrepreneurs | maker and manager work styles]] are important, but mixing them leads to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Trying to squeeze management tasks into maker time destroys productivity for half a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Similarly, having empty slots during manager time is inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It's crucial to understand what type of work you're doing and communicate these differences to your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Strategies for Finding and Buying Time

To dedicate 4 hours a day to the most impactful business levers, you need to find and buy time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Finding Time: Maker Habits
The speaker implements specific habits to facilitate [[maker_schedule_and_deep_work_importance | maker time]]:
*   **Prioritize a single project:** Decide on one most important project and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Early start:** Wake up early (e.g., 4 AM) and work until 9 AM, achieving 5 hours of focused work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This aligns with [[balancing_morning_routines_versus_productivity | balancing morning routines versus productivity]].
*   **Eliminate distractions:** Turn off notifications, work in a dark room with no windows, use earplugs, and remove all external stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **No "emergencies":** Understand that most business "emergencies" are not true crises and can wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Consistent sleep schedule:** Go to bed at the same time every night, including weekends, to optimize energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Weekend work:** Utilize weekends (104 days a year) for uninterrupted maker time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Buying Time: Eliminating Unproductive Activities
The speaker emphasizes that becoming more productive comes more from eliminating unproductive activities than from optimization hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. You have one "battery" and personal/household tasks drain from the same source as work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

Consider the time spent on common tasks and their replacement costs:
*   **Food (groceries, prepping, eating, cleaning):** 50 hours/month, replaceable for ~$800/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Home cleaning:** 25 hours/month, replaceable for ~$500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Laundry:** 16 hours/month, replaceable for ~$200/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

For approximately $1,500 a month, you can reclaim 96 hours (two full work weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. If your time is worth more than $15 per hour, this trade is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This is a form of reinvesting in yourself, but the reclaimed time must be used for valuable work, not leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

Additional unproductive time expenditures that can be eliminated for free include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>:
*   Following sports teams (4 hours/week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   Watching TV (21 hours/week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   Scrolling social media (17 hours/week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

By freeing up this time, individuals can work on the most important tasks for a significantly longer duration (e.g., 16 hours a day, 6 days a week) compared to those who spend only a few hours a week on productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This allows for a 30x increase in output for those dedicated to [[understanding_productivity_through_time_investment | understanding productivity through time investment]] and acting on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## The Speaker's Approach
The speaker's personal schedule involves four days of [[maker_schedule_and_deep_work_importance | maker time]] and one "manager day" (Mondays) where meetings and decisions are stacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. They also work weekends for additional maker time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The speaker's wife's schedule is flipped, with four manager days and one maker day, also utilizing weekends for maker tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

Regarding [[balancing_marriage_and_career_goals | balancing marriage and career goals]], the speaker and their spouse constantly discuss business and don't judge themselves for it, as it aligns with their shared interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Most of the speaker's "fun" is found in work itself, though they take a few short vacations a year with entrepreneurial friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
*   **Prioritize Inputs:** Identify the activities that truly grow your business (getting more customers, making them worth more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Structure Your Time:** Clearly separate [[maker_schedule_and_deep_work_importance | maker time]] for deep, focused work from [[the_manager_schedule_and_time_optimization | manager time]] for coordination and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Ruthlessly:** Cut out everything from your life that does not align with your business growth activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This is a core aspect of [[time_management_and_productivity_for_leaders | time management and productivity for leaders]].
*   **Invest in Yourself:** Be willing to pay for services (food prep, cleaning, laundry) to free up significant hours for high-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This is a form of [[value_of_learning_and_managing_time | value of learning and managing time]] and [[balancing_life_priorities_and_financial_goals | balancing life priorities and financial goals]].
*   **Consistency over Hacks:** Simple, permanent reductions in energy drainage are more effective than temporary optimization techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth:** By consistently working on the right things and eliminating distractions, you can achieve exponential growth and outpace competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. The secret is simply eliminating drains on your "one battery" that aren't aligned with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

Successful business growth depends on three key components: the entrepreneur's skills, character traits, and beliefs [00:00:21]. Often, a business's growth is constrained by a "bottleneck" or "weak link" within the entrepreneur's own character traits [00:00:37].

## The Power of "I Am" Statements

"I am" statements are among the most powerful declarations an individual can make about what they believe to be true of themselves [00:01:55]. These deeply embedded beliefs define an individual's [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] [00:08:10].

However, these statements can become limiting when they describe fixed, unchangeable traits that hinder growth. For example, entrepreneurs might say, "We are high anxiety people" [00:02:04] or "I'm an all or nothing type person" [00:02:21]. Such definitive statements imply that nothing can be done to change the trait [00:04:06].

### Shifting Your Language

To foster growth, one's [[identity_and_personal_transformation | identity]] must adapt to whatever is required for advancement [00:03:42]. This means changing the language used to describe oneself [00:04:11]. Instead of definitive "I am" statements, it is beneficial to use phrases like:
*   "I have a tendency towards..." [00:03:59]
*   "I have a proclivity for..." [00:04:01]
*   "I struggle with behaviors that are this way..." [00:08:49]

Changing the way we speak about ourselves changes the way we think, which in turn changes the way we live [00:04:11].

> [!QUESTION] Does this belief serve me?
> When identifying a trait you claim to possess, ask yourself: "Does this belief serve me? Is this going to help me accomplish the goals that I have?" [00:04:28] If the answer is no, then it is important to stop saying it [00:04:33].

## The Danger of Crutches and Superstitions

Beyond self-limiting "I am" statements, becoming dependent on routines, rituals, or external substances can also create significant weaknesses. These are referred to as "crutches" or "superstitions" [00:04:42].

> [!WARNING] The Weakening Effect of Dependence
> When individuals become "religiously" adherent to specific routines, using phrases like "I have to," "I must," or "I need to," they declare how the world *must* be, despite having no control over it [00:05:08]. This dependency ultimately makes them weaker and less resilient [00:04:54].

Examples of such dependencies include:
*   Needing alcohol, blunts, edibles, or pills to fall asleep [00:05:36].
*   Relying on coffee just to feel "normal" after prolonged use, losing its initial benefit [00:06:30].
*   Believing certain rituals are necessary for productivity, creativity, or mental well-being [00:09:03].

Historically, humans were able to function effectively without these modern dependencies [00:05:56]. True strength lies in being able to perform effectively regardless of external circumstances [00:07:32]. As an entrepreneur, the goal is to be resilient enough to succeed [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_challenges_to_achieve_success | independent of circumstance]] [00:09:55], embodying the principle: "You are source, not reaction" [00:10:01].

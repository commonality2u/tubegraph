Earning one's own respect is the most challenging form of respect to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key to achieving success, wealth, and status lies not just in setting goals, but in embodying the type of person who achieves those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The "Be-Do-Have" Framework

There are three elements to any goal:
1.  **External Result** The desired outcome, such as making more money or getting a six-pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Processes, Behaviors, Activity** The actions taken to achieve the goal, like "doing the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
3.  **Being the Type of Person** Identifying with and embodying the behaviors that lead to the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This framework, often referred to as "Be-Do-Have," is a common concept in personal development and behavioral psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Goals Alone Are Insufficient

Simply writing down a goal means nothing on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. While having a direction is better than none, winners and losers often share the same goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For instance, all Olympic athletes have the same goal, and all business people aim to increase their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If two people have identical goals but only one achieves them, the goal itself cannot be the primary driver of [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The true differentiator lies in the behaviors that lead to the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Even when people know what activities they *should* be doing to achieve a result (e.g., more advertising to get more customers), they often fail to do them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This highlights a gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## The Power of Identity

The most effective strategy for [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | consistent action]] and goal achievement is to shift one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This is achieved by asking a simple, [[effective_habits_and_mindset_strategies | keystone habit]] question: "What would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

This query helps to internally align one's actions with the desired identity. Instead of focusing on a 50-point checklist of activities, concentrating on the type of person one wants to become simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For example, asking "What would a wise man do?" or "What would a billionaire do?" provides a guiding principle for daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Reinforcing Identity Through Action
One's identity is like a voting system, where each action casts a vote for the type of person you are becoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This concept is a core element of [[impact_of_mindset_on_skill_acquisition and_success | mindset strategies]] for [[approach_to_learning_selfimprovement_and_mastering_skills | self-improvement]]. Affirmations alone (e.g., "I am a lion") are ineffective unless supported by evidence through action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. To become the desired person, one must start by doing the things that person would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

> "Your actions... literally becomes who you are, which means that we can actively change who we are by changing what we do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

The word "identity" itself, stemming from "entity" (being) and "identical" (repeated), means "repeated beingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This reinforces the idea that who you are is a result of your consistent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. By fixing for "the being," the necessary habits will naturally follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Practical Application: The "What Would X Do?" Hack

This framework can be applied to diverse scenarios:
*   "What would a person with a six-pack do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   "What would an amazing husband do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
*   "What would someone 10 times smarter than me do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   "What would Jesus do?" â€“ a powerful question in the Christian community that encourages acting in alignment with a specific ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   "What would King Solomon do?" or "What would Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger do?" for business and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

This approach simplifies decision-making by providing an overarching principle rather than a rigid list of daily routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Addressing Common Objections
Many people claim they don't know *what* their ideal self would do (e.g., "I don't know what a billionaire would do") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. However, most individuals inherently know what they need to do but simply aren't doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The issue is often a lack of action rather than a lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

If one truly doesn't know, they can adjust the question to a more attainable level (e.g., "What would a millionaire do?" or "What would someone trying to become a millionaire do?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The core is the willingness to ask a question that allows for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### The Uncommonly Obvious
People who achieve extraordinary results typically do the "uncommonly obvious thing" for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Their [[achieving_success_through_consistent_behaviors | consistent behaviors]] stem from *who they are* rather than being motivated solely by an external outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This internal motivation allows them to persevere indefinitely, leading to disproportionate returns, unlike those who might pull back once an external objective is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Ultimately, the process involves constantly asking: "What type of person do I wish to become?" and making that the guiding principle for every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This reinforces the story one tells themselves about who they are, leading to deep, long-lasting change that eventually becomes effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

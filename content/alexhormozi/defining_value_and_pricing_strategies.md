A key question for aspiring [[entrepreneurship_and_selling_strategies | entrepreneurs]] is "what should I sell?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> Understanding the fundamental categories of what can be sold and how to modify their delivery can help define value and shape [[pricing_strategies_and_adjustments | pricing strategies]].

## What Can Be Sold?

There are seven fundamental categories of things that can be sold, each available in digital and physical formats, totaling 14 distinct possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:

1.  **Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., a PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
2.  **Services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> (things done for other people)
    *   **Physical**: e.g., massage, lawn mowing, car repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., an ad agency making ads, buying media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
3.  **Access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., leasing a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., access to a digital content library like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
4.  **Attention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., a billboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., Facebook and Google selling audience eyeballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
5.  **Risk** (Insurance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., insuring a building, product guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., cyber threat insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>; AppleCare is paid insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
6.  **Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., actual US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
7.  **Endorsement/Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
    *   **Physical**: e.g., licensing a logo for merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
    *   **Digital**: e.g., a verified checkmark on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

It's also possible to sell a combination of these categories, such as a rock concert selling access to an experience, plus physical drinks/t-shirts, and digital recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Choosing What to Sell First

The decision of what to sell first largely depends on two factors:
1.  **Resources** you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
2.  Your **skills, value, and experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

Even first-time entrepreneurs have experience through osmosis from parents (e.g., doctor's child knowing about eyes, mechanic's child knowing car parts) or past odd jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Consider which of the seven categories you already have some experience with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> and which big problem you can solve given your resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

With limited starting capital (e.g., $100), the most common starting point is selling your time, often in the form of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The ideal "sweet spot" is providing the most value to a person for the least amount of money to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Delivery Cube: Enhancing Value and Profitability

Once you've identified what to sell, the [[optimizing_pricing_and_compensation_strategies | Delivery Cube]] offers six frames to [[strategies_for_increasing_business_value | enhance or make it more or less valuable]] or [[pricing_strategies_and_profit_maximization | more or less profitable]] as a business owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:

1.  **Delivery Model (Scale of Delivery)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
    *   **One-to-one**: E.g., a one-on-one call review system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   **Small group**: E.g., semi-private groups of five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
    *   **One-to-many**: E.g., a webinar to a thousand people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    Each has different value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

2.  **Level of Involvement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
    *   **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)**: You sell it with unlimited scale, but typically lower value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Done-With-You (DWY)**: You hold their hand through the process, offering an intermediate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   **Done-For-You (DFY)**: You do all the work, selling a final product or outcome; typically the most expensive and easiest to sell, but hardest to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

3.  **Support Level and Medium** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
    *   **Medium**: Chat, email, phone call, Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Email support is more scalable but less valuable than real-time Zoom call support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

4.  **Consumption Format** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
    *   **Format**: Visual, audio, text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   **Delivery**: Live or recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Live content is typically perceived as more valuable, especially if in-person, but is least scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Recorded digital content is most scalable but perceived as least valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

5.  **Speed and Convenience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   **Availability**: 24 hours a day vs. nine-to-five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, number of days per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Response Time**: Guaranteed response in 24 hours vs. three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   This involves a trade-off: overstaffing for customer convenience (incurring inefficiency) or full staff utilization where customers incur inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

6.  **The [[strategies_for_premium_pricing | 10x to 1/10th Test]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
    *   **10x Price**: "If I charged 10 times more for my current thing, what would I have to change about it to be worth 10 times more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> This prompts thinking about how to provide significantly more value (e.g., turning a $10,000 thing into a [[pricing_strategies_for_highticket_items | $100,000 thing]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **1/10th Price**: "If I had to deliver the same or even more value, but could only charge one-tenth the price, what else would I do that would be perceived as valuable but wouldn't cost much?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> This focuses on finding highly scalable, low-cost additions that maintain value.

These frameworks provide a starting point for determining what to sell, and how to scale it to be more profitable and/or valuable to the end consumer, while considering internal resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

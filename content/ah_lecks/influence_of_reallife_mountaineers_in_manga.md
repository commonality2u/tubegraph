Manga has frequently drawn inspiration from real-life figures and events, often translating their experiences into compelling narratives. A notable example of this is the influence of actual mountaineers on the creation and development of popular manga series like *The Climber*.

## Katō Bunatarō: The Immortal Mountaineer

On November 1st, 2007, manga author Shinichi Sakamoto released his series *The Climber* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This manga is based on the life of Katō Bunatarō, a "very strange guy" known in the 1930s as "the immortal Mountaineer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Alpinists of his era were convinced of his invincibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Mountaineering itself is described as an "insane" hobby, involving dangerous elements like spiked shoes (crampons), carrying extensive gear, and being roped together to prevent fatal falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It combines elements of hiking, rock climbing, camping, land scuba diving, and snow hydrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Katō Bunatarō was known for his "insane escapades," such as descending some of Japan's highest mountains, like Mount Yari, all by himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He would ascend mountains at "extremely fast rates," a highly dangerous practice as mountaineers must carefully manage their pace to avoid altitude sickness above 8,000 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

After being warned by fellow mountaineer Nakamura that he was "living on borrowed time," Katō wrote a 744-word manifesto explaining his unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He considered himself an "Alpine Ali ganger," someone willing to take "life-threatening routes that hadn't been discovered yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He also preferred to climb alone, believing companionship would "distract him from that process" of searching for truth and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. His motto was, "Why climb mountains? I climb because I want to climb, surely it's a good enough reason to climb if one is moved to do so by some irrepressible Instinct of the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Two years later, Katō began climbing with a partner, Yoshida Tomihisa, possibly due to his marriage or new route requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. In January 1936, at age 30, Katō Bunatarō tragically passed away during an attempt to revisit Mount Yari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For 70 years, he was primarily remembered by a memorial, a stone engraving, and his manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It was only after [[Artistic evolution and creative freedom in manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] retold his story in *The Climber* that he became remembered through art depicting "psychedelic body horror ice Dragons, cloaked Warriors running away from baby eating Gods, Pirates, zombies, and the most bizarre abstract depictions of anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Shinichi Sakamoto's Creative Freedom

Initially, *The Climber* was a collaboration between illustrator [[Artistic evolution and creative freedom in manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] and writer Yoshiro Naida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. After the first year, Naida departed, leading to a "massive drastic tonal shift" in the manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The initial direction was a generic sports manga, with a shy savant high school student joining a rock climbing club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Naida's departure, though challenging, granted [[Artistic evolution and creative freedom in manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] "full creative freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. He scrapped the high school setting, killing off a coach and ending the club program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The story then transitioned to a new timeline where the protagonist, Kato, was an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Sakamoto made two significant changes:
1.  **Shifted thematic focus**: He wanted the story to be about the "real Katō Bunatarō," exploring his manifesto and the profound "why" behind his dangerous solo climbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The story focused on the origin of the desire to climb K2, "the Moby Dick of mountain climbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Changed artistic approach**: Instead of realism, Sakamoto depicted the rock climbing experience through [[Analogies and visual metaphors in storytelling | visual metaphors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Avalanches were shown as collapsing buildings, sexual experiences as psychedelic body horror, and mountain climbing as allegories of pirate ships, zombie apocalypses, or warriors chased by gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Katō's internal conflicts were visualized as split feelings and a mind and body fighting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. He also dramatically increased the frequency of double-page spreads, traditionally reserved for the most important moments, tripling their average in later volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This demonstrated his artistic effort and commitment to the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

*The Climber* ultimately became a story of two journeys: a mountaineer's search for meaning through K2, and an author's pursuit of that meaning through the creation of his story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Katō Yasuo: Post-Monsoon Everest Pioneer

[[Artistic evolution and creative freedom in manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] also honored another real-life mountaineer, Katō Yasuo, in the final three chapters of *The Climber* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Katō Yasuo, a 24-year-old in 1973, was part of a Japanese team that became the first to climb Mount Everest in a post-monsoon season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

Yasuo summited Mount Everest three times, the third in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. During this final ascent, he attempted a solo push to the summit but was forced back by strong winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. A second attempt with a partner led to the partner experiencing frostbite, and Yasuo continued alone to the peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. On the descent, they ran out of oxygen and faced escalating winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Five months later, their bodies were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>. Like Katō Bunatarō, Katō Yasuo passed away in his early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

Sakamoto integrated Yasuo's story into *The Climber* by basing a chapter on Yasuo's journal entry about demoiselle cranes, birds known for migrating across the Himalayas by riding wind currents, despite half their flock dying in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. He juxtaposed these facts with panels of a naked baby climbing a mountain alongside the birds, and then with various animals following their instincts (a monkey reaching for fruit, a ladybug flying, a bird leaving its nest, a fish flopping, the sun dawning), culminating in a depiction of Katō Bunatarō lifelessly climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

This [[Analogies and visual metaphors in storytelling | visual metaphor]] suggests that humans, like these animals, are driven by an "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" to make extreme decisions "purely because we just feel like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. It implies that the reason for climbing mountains, or pursuing any challenging endeavor, is simply "because they were already there in the first place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

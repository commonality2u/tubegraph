Artistic evolution and creative freedom are profoundly explored through the works of various manga and comic book creators, who have pushed boundaries in visual storytelling and narrative approaches.

## Shinichi Sakamoto and *The Climber*

Manga author Shinichi Sakamoto released *The Climber* on November 1st, 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This series, initially based on the real-life "Immortal Mountaineer" Kato Buntaro from the 1930s, underwent a significant [[personal_motivations_driving_artists_and_creators | tonal shift]] after its original writer, Yoshiro Naida, departed a year into its serialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

This change granted Sakamoto full creative freedom, transforming the manga from a generic high school sports story into a deeper exploration of its subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Sakamoto aimed to tell the story of the real Kato Buntaro, attempting to understand the mountaineer's philosophy and his decision to undertake life-threatening solo climbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Visual Metaphors and Artistic Innovation
Sakamoto drastically changed the artistic approach, moving beyond realism to depict the experience of rock climbing through [[analogies_and_visual_metaphors_in_storytelling | visual metaphors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>:
*   Avalanches are shown as collapsing buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Sexual experiences are drawn with psychedelic body horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Mountain climbing is conveyed through allegories of pirate ships navigating storms, zombie apocalypses, or cloaked warriors chased by gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Kato's internal conflicts are depicted through abstract imagery of his mind and body fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

After the writer's departure, Sakamoto also significantly increased the frequency of double-page spreads, from an average of 0.52 in the first three volumes to 1.43 in subsequent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. These double spreads are typically reserved for the most important moments, serving as a visual testament to the artist's effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Alex Ross: Hyperrealism and Dedication

In 1987, Alex Ross emerged as an artist obsessed with superhero comics, viewing them as embodying virtues akin to Greek gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Raised by a professional illustrator, he recreated works of George Pérez and Bernie Wrightson as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. In art school, he studied hyperrealist painters like Andrew Loomis, Norman Rockwell, and Salvador Dalí <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Ross sought to find meaning in these realistic art forms while applying them to comic books, which traditionally used pen and ink for quick, efficient production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. His solution was to use paint, aiming to make superhero stories as believable as possible, portraying characters not just as powerful figures but as extensions of relatable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

His approach gained recognition with *Marvels* (1993) and *Kingdom Come* (1996) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. In *Kingdom Come*, Ross utilized the perspective of an everyday person to depict the intimidating power of superheroes, making them appear as "weapons of war morphed into humanoid form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. His detailed illustrations, including cinematic facial expressions requiring readers to "read between the lines," showcase his unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. He often used reference photos, sometimes even posing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

Ross's dedication to his craft is evident in his extensive knowledge of superhero history and his willingness to challenge industry expectations to achieve verisimilitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Dave McKean: Abstract and Dreamlike Art

Dave McKean, a painter and abstract artist, was hired by DC in 1988 to illustrate *Black Orchid* with Neil Gaiman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. His artwork was so impactful that it saved the series from being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

For *Arkham Asylum*, McKean's art style is described as loose, hazy, and dreamlike, making the narrative challenging to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. He aimed to depict characters like the Joker and Two-Face not realistically, but as "the idea of him" or concepts of their mental states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. McKean strongly felt that a story about insanity did not deserve a "cookie-cutter treatment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

Despite conflicts with his writer and editors who desired more clarity and conventional themes, McKean refused to compromise his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. He believed that overpainted, lavish illustrations could hamper storytelling, and his goal was to depict the story in a way that made sense to him, without asking the reader to necessarily follow a logical path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. His use of gouache, a difficult medium, further underscores his commitment to his unique artistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

## Haro Aso: Biology and Negative Space

Between 2006 and 2011, Haro Aso worked on numerous one-shots, all expressing themes through biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Her background as an editorial designer influenced her strong sense of composition and her expert use of negative space to convey mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Her stories often treat humans as malleable "blobs" within worlds with slightly altered natural rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

Her masterpiece, *Land of the Lustrous*, tells a story about Moon people, gemstones, and snail people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The protagonist, Phos, is made of fragile phosphophyllite and undergoes physical changes to become stronger, leading to a loss of identity and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The manga uses negative space in diverse ways to express opposition, motion, loss, and hope, guiding the reader's eye and creating a sense of the world narrowing around the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. Despite its deceptively simple look, the art, inspired by Buddhist symbolism, creates both beauty and terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Inio Asano: Hyperrealism with CG Integration

Inio Asano refined the technique of integrating real-life photos and CG into manga. In his early works like *What a Wonderful Day* and *Solenin*, he would draw characters in his distinct style and place them into hyper-realistic backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This technique complemented his writing, which often set mundane human stories against realistic backdrops, offering insights into human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.

His series *Goodnight Punpun* (2007) showcased his mastery of this process, involving staff taking reference photos in Tokyo, which were then digitally manipulated in Photoshop to create story settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

Asano's later work, *Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction*, marked a new artistic direction by making CG a main character, featuring aliens, war machines, time travel, and a giant UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. His team recreated real-world locations in 3D software for complex scenes, even if it meant a page that previously took a day to draw by hand now took a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. This labor-intensive approach allowed for visually impressive and intricate panels that would be difficult to achieve otherwise, like a dream sequence showing alternate timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Asano's commitment to hyperrealism (or "verisimilitude") aims to reflect human behavior, showing "deeply flawed, hurt, complicated, unreasonable, inconsiderate human beings" in full detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

## Kentaro Miura and *Berserk*

Kentaro Miura's *Berserk* is regarded as a definitive work of "pure effort" in manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Beginning in 1989, prior to the widespread availability of digital tools, every line, detail, and conveyed energy came from Miura's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. His war panels are renowned for their intricate detail, with each horse, knight, and swordsman possessing unique designs and actions, creating a relentless, violent, and chaotic depiction of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

Miura maintained this intensity throughout the series, up until his passing at chapter 364 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. Even early in his career, he had immense confidence in his ability to make readers "sit with certain moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. For example, he dedicated eight entire pages to a single second of Guts's reaction after inadvertently killing a child, meticulously detailing his shock, realization, and subsequent internal turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This dedication was remarkable, considering each chapter at the time was only 18 pages and took up to two weeks to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

Miura's artistic evolution, encompassing improvements in anatomy and perspective, consistently retained his core focus on action, movement, and rage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. His use of a dip pen for rendering every texture and line was incredibly time-consuming, yet he found it satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. *Berserk* is seen as a work that embodies honesty, showing the growth, struggles, and changing perceptions of its creator over decades, serving as a tangible piece of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

## The Instinct to Create

These artists demonstrate that sometimes extreme creative decisions are made not for external validation or revolutionizing an industry, but simply out of an "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. They chose to make their demanding creative processes even harder because they cared deeply about their stories, akin to a mountaineer's inherent drive to climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

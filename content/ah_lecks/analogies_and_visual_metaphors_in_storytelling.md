Storytelling, particularly in visual mediums like manga and comic books, frequently employs analogies and visual metaphors to convey complex themes, emotions, and character experiences in a profound and unique way. This approach allows creators to transcend literal representation, offering readers a deeper, more interpretive understanding of the narrative.

## Shinichi Sakamoto's *The Climber*

Originally conceived in 2007, the manga *The Climber* by [[influence_of_reallife_mountaineers_in_manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] began as a generic high school sports story with Yoshiro Naida as the writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. However, when Naida left the project after the first year, Sakamoto gained full [[artistic_evolution_and_creative_freedom_in_manga | creative freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This led to a drastic tonal and [[impact_of_unique_artistic_styles_in_comics_and_manga | artistic shift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

Instead of a typical sports manga, Sakamoto aimed to tell a story about the real Kataro, exploring his motivations for solitary, life-risking climbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. The artistic approach moved away from realism to depict the experience of rock climbing through [[impact_of_unique_artistic_styles_in_comics_and_manga | visual metaphors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>:
*   An avalanche might be depicted as a collapsing building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   Sexual experiences are drawn as psychedelic body horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   Mountain climbing allegories include pirate ships navigating a storm, surviving a zombie apocalypse, or a cloaked warrior pursued by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
*   Kataro's internal conflicts are visually represented as his feelings splitting in two, his mind and body battling, and his intuition pulling in opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

Sakamoto also increased the frequency of double-page spreads, using them to emphasize important moments and showcase the artist's immense effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. The core of *The Climber* unfolds as two journeys: a mountaineer's search for meaning through K2, and an author's quest for meaning through the creation of his story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. The artwork itself becomes visual proof of a creator's dedication and pursuit of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

In the final chapters of *The Climber*, Sakamoto honors the mountaineer Yasuo Kato, who tragically died in his early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:04:00">[55:04:00]</a>. He incorporates Yasuo's journal entry about demoiselle cranes that migrate across the Himalayas, a journey that kills half their flock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>. Sakamoto contrasts panels of a naked baby climbing a mountain alongside these birds with facts about animals following their instincts, suggesting an "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" that drives extreme decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:55:00">[59:55:00]</a>.

## Dave McKean's *Arkham Asylum*

Artist Dave McKean, hired by DC in 1988, used an "unrealistic" and abstract approach for *Arkham Asylum*, aiming to depict reality from the perspective of someone with a chemical imbalance in their brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. The narrative is visually and narratively challenging, alternating between disturbing diary entries of the asylum's founder, Amadeus Arkham, and Batman's "acid trip" experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.

McKean's style blurs character silhouettes, making them appear as ideas rather than distinct forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. For example, the Joker's "super sanity" is expressed through visuals that convey his mind as a roller coaster moving at extreme speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>. Two-Face's fear of morality is shown through panels where his mind is confined to binary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. The art often resembles blurred Polaroids, creating a dreamlike quality where physical objects are malleable, reflecting how individuals perceive reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. McKean deliberately chose this art style, despite conflicts with his writer and editors, because he felt a story about insanity shouldn't be "cookie-cutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

## Haruko Ichikawa's *Land of the Lustrous*

Manga author Haruko Ichikawa consistently uses themes of biology and the human condition in her works, often presenting stories where humans are treated like "blobs" on a floating rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. Her earlier experience as an editorial designer influenced her use of negative space to guide the reader's eye and evoke mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.

In *Land of the Lustrous*, the protagonist, Phosphophyllite (Phos), seeks to end a war by replacing parts of her fragile body with stronger materials, a process that causes her to lose parts of her memory and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>. The use of negative space in the artwork visually conveys the story's themes:
*   It highlights the contrast between the character and the surrounding world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>.
*   It cleverly depicts motion through the removal of white space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>.
*   It expresses feelings of loss and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>.
*   It creates a sense of the main character viewing the world through an abyss, forcing them forward in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.

Ichikawa's compositions are deceptively simple, often using characters outside of panels to guide the reader to the next page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>. The Moon people are inspired by Buddhist symbolism, creating both beauty and terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>.

## Inio Asano's Digital Integration

Inio Asano mastered the integration of real-life photos and computer graphics (CG) into his artwork, particularly evident in earlier works like *What a Wonderful World!* and *Solanin*, where hand-drawn characters are placed into hyper-realistic settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. This technique complements his writing, which often explores mundane human settings to offer insights into ourselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:00">[38:14:00]</a>.

In *Goodnight Punpun*, Asano's team used reference photos of Tokyo, digitally manipulating assets in Photoshop to create settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. This allows for a story that follows a cartoon bird dealing with trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.

With *Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction*, Asano's first manga where CG was a main character, he pushed boundaries further by integrating war machines, time travel, and a giant UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. Scenes impossible to create in person, like a courtroom, were recreated in 3D software for character movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. Although this process took significantly longer, it enabled visually stunning and complex panels that would be exceedingly difficult to achieve by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:12:00">[40:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>. Asano's primary goal is for his stories and characters to mirror human behavior, allowing readers to see themselves in full 4K ray-tracing settings, embracing both flaws and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>.

## Kentaro Miura's *Berserk*

Kentaro Miura's *Berserk* is cited as a definitive example of pure artistic effort, made even more remarkable by its origins in 1989, prior to digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>. Every line and detail conveys intense energy, with complex war scenes featuring uniquely designed knights and horses, creating a believable and chaotic depiction of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[44:09:00]</a>.

Miura's confidence in his art allowed him to dedicate multiple pages to small, character-driven interactions, letting moments simmer and convey deep emotions without explicit dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:00">[45:46:00]</a>. An example is an eight-page sequence depicting Guts's emotional reaction to inadvertently killing a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>. This dedication, spanning multiple days of drawing for a single moment, showcases Miura's commitment to immersing the reader in specific experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>. According to illustrator Chloe Gendron, Miura's early work involved hand-drawing every texture and line, a painstaking process that could take days for a single panel, reflecting the artist's dedication and intrinsic enjoyment of the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>.

This dedication to artistic honesty and growth is mirrored in the way *Berserk* volumes serve as a historical record of Miura's journey, showing how his perception of the world and characters evolved over his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:32:00">[52:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:48:00">[52:48:00]</a>. The manga stands as proof of someone willing to "bleed for their story," driven by an irrepressible instinct rather than external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:57:00">[59:57:00]</a>.

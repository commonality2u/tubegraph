The world of comics and manga showcases a diverse range of artistic styles, each contributing uniquely to storytelling and reader experience. The deliberate choices made by artists regarding their visual approach can profoundly impact the narrative, themes, and overall reception of their work.

## Shinichi Sakamoto's *The Climber*

Shinichi Sakamoto's manga *The Climber*, which began serialization on November 1, 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, initially followed a generic sports manga formula, depicting high school rock climbing with tropes like bullies, tournaments, and high school crushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This changed drastically when the original writer, Yoshiro Naida, left the project around Chapter 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This departure granted Sakamoto [[artistic_evolution_and_creative_freedom_in_manga | full creative freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. He scrapped the initial plot, shifting the story to focus on an adult protagonist and his exploration of the real-life "Immortal Mountaineer," Katō Būtarō, whose life and manifesto inspired the manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Sakamoto's artistic approach underwent a significant transformation. Instead of striving for realism, he began to depict experiences through visual metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>:
*   Avalanches might be shown as collapsing buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Sexual experiences were drawn with psychedelic body horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Mountain climbing was allegorized through pirate ships navigating storms or cloaked warriors chased by gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   The protagonist's internal conflicts were visualized as his feelings splitting or his mind and body fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

This shift also led to a near-tripling of double-page spreads, which are typically reserved for pivotal moments and serve as "visual proof of an author's efforts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Through this unique artistic evolution, *The Climber* became a visually stunning work of fiction that explores the **personal motivations driving artists and creators** and mountaineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Alex Ross and Hyperrealism in American Comics

Alex Ross, deeply inspired by superhero comics and classical painters like Andrew Loomis, Norman Rockwell, and Salvador Dalí, sought to bring a hyperrealistic approach to comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. He believed that the virtues embodied by superheroes were akin to those seen in Greek gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, and he aimed to depict them in their "most believable shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Ross wanted readers to perceive superheroes as extensions of themselves—like a friend, teacher, or neighbor—wearing costumes that felt like a "extension of their own skin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

His unique painted style, using gouache, led to significant works like *Marvels* (1994) and *Kingdom Come* (1996) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. In *Kingdom Come*, Ross's art makes superheroes feel like mythological beings or "weapons of war morphed into humanoid form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. His compositions often take the POV of an everyday person, emphasizing the terror of living alongside beings with immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

Ross's work requires readers to "read in between the lines," as subtle facial expressions convey complex emotions, a rarity in a medium often designed for quick reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. He utilizes reference photos for layouts and character designs, even posing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. His commitment to detail, such as drawing reflections on Iron Man's armor that warp based on the surroundings, demonstrates an exceptional dedication to realism, even when not explicitly requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

For Ross, the verisimilitude—the appearance of being true or real—was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. His intention was to create a "legend" that would be read for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## Dave McKean and Abstract Art in *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth*

Dave McKean, a painter and abstract artist, was hired by DC in 1988 to illustrate *Black Orchid* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. His unique artwork convinced DC to release the series, which transformed a "caped pink chameleon hero" into a more striking figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

McKean later collaborated with Neil Gaiman on *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth* (1989), where his art style was crucial to conveying the story's themes of insanity and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. The comic is narratively and visually challenging, constantly alternating between the founder Amadeus Arkham's "unwell diary entries" and Batman's "acid trip" experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

McKean's Joker lacks a clear silhouette, appearing more as "the idea of him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Two-Face is depicted as fearing his own morality, his mind clinging to binary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Some panels resemble Polaroids with blur and high exposure, creating a dreamlike quality where physical things are malleable based on perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. The art doesn't ask the reader to follow a clear narrative but rather to experience the story's themes of psychological distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

McKean's style often caused conflict with the writer and editors who desired more clarity, but he "strongly felt that a story like this didn't deserve the cookie-cutter treatment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. His refusal to compromise resulted in a byproduct of creative conflict, perfectly mirroring the story's subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Haruko Ichikawa and Biological Themes

Haruko Ichikawa's one-shot mangas, created between 2006 and 2011, explored themes through biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Her background as an editorial designer influenced her use of negative space to guide the eye and set the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Her stories often treat humans like "any other blob that stands on this floating piece of rock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, exploring fantastical biological premises such as plants growing like humans or shellfish using human bodies as shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

Her masterpiece, *Land of the Lustrous*, tells a story of gem people fighting moon people and snail people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. The protagonist, Phosphophyllite, gradually replaces parts of her fragile body with stronger materials, leading to a loss of memory and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

Ichikawa's art visually conveys the mood and themes. Negative space is used extensively to show contrast, convey motion, express loss, or evoke hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, making the world appear as an "abyss" or a "tunnel" forcing the character forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. Her compositions are expertly prepped, sometimes featuring characters extending beyond panels to guide the reader through motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Despite looking deceptively simple, her ability to depict metallic liquid or imbue Buddhist-inspired moon people with beauty and terror highlights her unique talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Inio Asano and Hyperrealistic Settings with CG

Inio Asano refined the use of hyperrealistic settings combined with distinct character designs in his early works like *What a Wonderful Day* and *Solanin* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This technique—drawing characters in his style and placing them in realistic photographic or CG backgrounds—fit his writing, which often focused on "human mundane settings" to offer insight into ourselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.

His process involves his staff taking reference photos in Tokyo, then digitally manipulating them in Photoshop to create the story's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. This approach peaked in *Goodnight Punpun* (2007-2014), where a cartoon bird navigates trauma within a hyperrealistic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

After *Punpun*, Asano sought to "spice things up" by integrating CG as a main character in *Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This manga features aliens, war machines, and a giant UFO, elements that would be difficult or legally impossible to create with traditional photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. While using 3D software for settings increased the time per page significantly (from a day to a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>, it allowed for complex scenes like alternate timelines, which are relatively simple to achieve in Blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

Asano's primary goal is for his stories to "mirror the way we behave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, using "bland weird characters" to reflect our impulsive and flawed human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. He aims for verisimilitude, allowing readers to see themselves "in full 4K Ray tracing settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>, reinforcing that imperfections are part of being human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

## Kentaro Miura's *Berserk*

Kentaro Miura's *Berserk* is regarded as a definitive work that exemplifies "pure effort" in manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Beginning in 1989, without access to digital tools, every line and detail conveyed immense energy and the artist's dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Miura's war panels, where every horse, knight, and swordsman has a unique design and pose, create a believable sense of "relentlessly violent and chaotic" war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

Miura maintained this intensity through 364 chapters until his passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. Even in his early career, he demonstrated confidence in his ability to make readers "sit with certain moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. For example, he dedicated eight full pages to a single second of a character's shock and realization after an accidental killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Given that each chapter was only 18 pages long and took up to two weeks to finish, this level of dedication to a brief moment highlights his confidence in conveying character emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

The energy conveyed in Miura's art comes from dynamic line direction and detailed rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. Every texture and line was hand-drawn, making the effort involved "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. *Berserk* creates a feeling that cannot be replicated without an artist being willing to give their art "a piece of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>, reflecting the author's passion, growth, and struggles throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. The manga serves as "proof of someone who a long time ago made the decision to go on a thousand-mile long run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

## The Unconscious Drive of Artistic Creation

Ultimately, these artists, despite their varied styles—from realism to abstract, from traditional to digital—share a common thread: an "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. They chose to make their creative process harder, not to prove others wrong or to revolutionize the industry, but because they had an idea and were compelled to execute it, resulting in incredible works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. This inherent drive, akin to a penguin waddling towards its inevitable death on distant mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a> or a child learning piano without formal lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>, represents the freedom to make extreme decisions "purely because we just feel like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.

For these artists, their unique styles are not just aesthetic choices but a fundamental expression of their being, a duty to act upon an innate urge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

*Slam Dunk* is a highly influential Japanese manga series created by [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Takehiko Inoue]] that significantly popularized basketball in Japan and globally. The series, which began in 1990, became a worldwide phenomenon, playing a crucial role in the rapid growth of basketball in countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, India, and the Philippines, where the sport was previously not mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

## Background of Basketball in Japan
Before *Slam Dunk*, basketball was not a widely recognized sport in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Major sports like baseball, sumo wrestling, soccer, and tennis already had massive audiences, but basketball's rapid growth only began sometime in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This phenomenon is largely attributed to *Slam Dunk* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Notably, two of the three Japanese-born players drafted into the NBA, Yuta Watanabe (drafted 2018) and Rui Hachimura (drafted 2019), grew up as massive fans of *Slam Dunk* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Their youth basketball teammates and coaches were also fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Creation and [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Artistic Evolution]]
[[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Takehiko Inoue]] (born 1967 in Kagoshima, Japan) developed a passion for Kendo, basketball, and drawing in his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Despite his talent, he never received formal academic art training due to financial constraints, having been raised by his mother and grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. His motivation to become an artist stemmed from his obsession with the manga *Dokaben* (1972), which he admired for its ability to create an illusion of motion and make characters feel real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

After dropping out of college at age 20, [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] worked as an assistant illustrator for *City Hunter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. He then began submitting basketball-themed one-shots to Jump magazine, with one titled *Purple Kaede* winning the Tezuka Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. His first official debut as a mangaka was with *Chameleon Jail* (1990), where he served as the illustrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

In 1990, Jump magazine approved his dream story, a manga about high school basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Despite the lack of media coverage for basketball at the time in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] aimed to create a grounded and honest portrayal of the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. *Slam Dunk*'s first chapter debuted on October 1, 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

The initial chapters of *Slam Dunk* featured a "cheesy, simpy comedy" focused on protagonist Hanamichi Sakuragi trying to impress a girl named Haruko Akagi to join the basketball team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. While some speculate this was due to editorial pressure, it is more likely [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] was still finding his [[artistic_evolution_and_creative_freedom_in_manga | artistic evolution]] and referencing popular manga humor at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] himself acknowledged room for improvement in these early chapters and actively incorporated reader feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

## [[themes_of_growth_and_redemption_in_inoues_works | Themes of Growth and Redemption]] and Basketball Immersion
As the series progressed, it shifted from romantic comedy to a serious and grounded sports story about basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. The character of Sakuragi became a lens through which readers unfamiliar with basketball could learn about the sport, asking basic questions about passing, dribbling, shooting, fouls, and play styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Sakuragi's obsession with rebounds, an "unsung hero" aspect of basketball, reflects [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue's]] personal experience and deep love for the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Many practice techniques depicted in the manga, like fixing shooting form, were things [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] himself learned as a player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

The core of *Slam Dunk* focuses on the Shohoku High School basketball teamâ€”a group of "misfit high schoolers" who, despite their differences, find common ground and connection through their shared love for basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. The manga conveys the intensity, motion, and emotional depth of the game, making readers feel as if they are on the court or in the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. The astronomic improvement in both the artwork and writing demonstrates [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue's]] commitment to making *Slam Dunk* a great story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>.

## Global Impact and NBA Parallels
The reception for *Slam Dunk* rapidly grew, turning it into a global phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. This was significantly aided by the 1993 anime adaptation by Toei Animation, which created a massive overseas fanbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. Concurrently, the NBA experienced its own boom in the 1990s, gaining unprecedented worldwide traction, particularly after the 1992 Olympics' "Dream Team" (featuring players like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Michael Jordan) and the dominance of Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

[[influence_of_takehiko_inoue_on_global_basketball_popularity | Takehiko Inoue]] intentionally incorporated references to popular NBA teams and players to bridge the gap between his fictional world and the real sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>.
*   **Shohoku High School** was based on the Chicago Bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.
*   **Kainan High** was based on the LA Lakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.
*   **Shoyo School** was based on the Boston Celtics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ryonan** was based on the Orlando Magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.
*   **Mihagi** was the Milwaukee Bucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.

Characters were also inspired by real players:
*   **Kaede Rukawa** was overtly based on Michael Jordan, sharing a similar play style, personality, and even an arm sleeve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.
*   **Hisashi Mitsui** is said to be based on Craig Hodges, sharing a number, team origin, and three-point shooting specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>.
*   **Shinichi Maki** has a play style and footwork similar to Magic Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Takenori Akagi** is inspired by either Patrick Ewing or Scottie Pippen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.
*   **Hanamichi Sakuragi** is a direct and undeniable inspiration from Dennis Rodman, particularly his appearance, play style, "psychotic obsession with rebounds," and ability to thrive under pressure, mirroring Rodman's unorthodox and impactful presence in the NBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.

The final opposing team in the manga, **Sannoh Industry**, was based on the real Japanese high school team **Noshiro Technical**, which was led by Yuta Tabuse, Japan's number one ranked high school player at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>. Tabuse later became the first Japanese-born player drafted into the NBA in 2004, playing for the Phoenix Suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>. This direct reference highlights [[takehiko_inoues_impact_on_japanese_basketball | Takehiko Inoue's impact on Japanese basketball]].

## Legacy and Further Influence
*Slam Dunk* concluded after 276 chapters over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>. Its weekly sales during its release were the highest in Shonen Jump's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>. To this day, it is listed as the seventh highest-selling manga of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>. The anime adaptation also achieved significant global success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.

The series cultivated a significant cultural following, with fans recreating iconic scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>, and the Japanese Women's Basketball team used its opening song as their entrance for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>.

In 2008, [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] founded a *Slam Dunk* scholarship to help students afford international basketball programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. In 2022, [[takehiko_inoues_career_and_artistic_style | Inoue]] himself directed a fully CG animated *Slam Dunk* film, which became the fifth highest-grossing animated film of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This film further solidified the connection between Sakuragi's body language and play style to that of Dennis Rodman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

The core of *Slam Dunk*'s influence lies in its ability to inspire a profound connection to the sport by building on "very real narratives from the people who came to fall in love with the sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>. One fan from India started the first basketball club at his school after reading *Slam Dunk*, which has now grown into a full boys' and girls' team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. This demonstrates the profound impact *Slam Dunk* has had on [[takehiko_inoues_impact_on_japanese_basketball | Japanese basketball]] and its [[influence_of_takehiko_inoue_on_global_basketball_popularity | influence on global basketball popularity]].

Urban development and the creation of public works have profoundly shaped cities throughout history. The approaches to these endeavors, however, have evolved significantly, reflecting changing societal values, technological capabilities, and political climates. This article explores these perspectives, drawing heavily on the example of Robert Moses in New York City and contrasting his era with contemporary challenges and philosophies.

## The Era of Robert Moses: A Catalyst for Large-Scale Public Works

Robert Moses stands as a towering, if controversial, figure in the history of American urban development. His career, primarily in New York City and State, epitomized an era focused on large-scale, transformative public projects. Professor Kenneth T. Jackson notes that Moses represented a past when "we wanted to build bridges and superhighways," a contrast to the present day [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | the evolution and future of the tech industry]].

### Scope and Scale of Achievements
Moses was responsible for an unprecedented array of public works. Professor Jackson lists "essentially all the big roads, all the bridges, all the parks, the United Nations, Lincoln Center, the World's Fairs of 1939 and 1964, and hundreds of other things he built". He is considered by some to be "the greatest builder in American history," with "nobody really in second place". His influence extended to the national interstate highway system, largely built by engineers who had trained under him, and he also consulted on projects internationally.

Notable projects include:
*   The White Stone Bridge, a "gigantic bridge...beautiful...finished in the late 1930s on time and under budget".
*   Jones Beach, considered "one of the great public facilities on earth".
*   Iconic bridges such as the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, and the Triborough Bridge, described as "really works of art".
*   Over 700 playgrounds.
*   An arterial highway system and the relocation of 200,000 people from old tenements to new public housing projects.

### Methods and Accumulation of Power
Moses wielded "more power than any urban figure in American history" for roughly half a century. His ability to get things done stemmed from several factors:
*   **Multiple Concurrent Roles:** He held "as many as six, eight, ten different things at once," making it difficult for mayors or governors to entirely remove him from power.
*   **Efficiency and Results:** Governors and mayors, eager to open new projects, respected and needed Moses's ability to deliver "efficiently, on time, under budget".
*   **Financial Autonomy:** He created entities like the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which generated continuous revenue from tolls. This "massive pot of money" allowed him to fund further projects without direct legislative approval. He was skilled at drafting legislation with clauses that secured his chairmanship, removable only "for cause".
*   **Forceful Tactics:** Moses "didn't worry about legalities," sometimes starting construction and daring judges to halt projects already underway. He issued 90-day eviction notices for projects like the Cross Bronx Expressway, expecting immediate compliance. He would also threaten resignation to get his way.
*   **Reputation:** He was "ruthless, arrogant and honest". People both feared and respected him. He worked for a nominal $1 a year salary and was not driven by personal financial gain, dying with less money than he started with. His primary motivation was power to build.

### Vision and Character
Moses possessed a "singular focus" and an immense work ethic, famously using two limousines with secretaries to work continuously while traveling. Despite his influence on car culture, he never drove a car himself. His vision was for a modern city, but one where "everybody should live in the suburbs and drive cars". He viewed old neighborhoods and tenements as slums to be cleared, famously considering Greenwich Village a slum. Professor Jackson describes him as "personally a jerk...arrogant, self-centered...vindictive and ruthless", but also notes his ability to inspire workers, making them feel they were "building a cathedral". His guiding principle was often summarized as, "in order to make an omelet, you have to break eggs".

### Impact and Legacy in New York City
Professor Jackson argues that "had Robert Moses not lived, not done what he did, New York would have followed the trail of maybe Detroit". He credits Moses's public works with helping New York avoid the decline seen in many other Northeastern and Midwestern cities. The expressways, though controversial, are seen as essential infrastructure. Economically, seven of the top ten most valuable highway segments in America are in the New York City area, many planned by Moses.

However, Moses's legacy is also fraught with criticism:
*   **Disregard for Mass Transit:** He is criticized for refusing to incorporate mass transit options into his highway projects. Professor Jackson counters that Moses wasn't in charge of subways and that public transit survived better in New York than elsewhere.
*   **Neighborhood Destruction:** His highways often tore through existing neighborhoods, contributing to urban sprawl and congestion. The Cross Bronx Expressway is a prime example, though Professor Jackson questions the characterization of neighborhoods like East Tremont as being "perfectly wonderful" before Moses, suggesting Jewish populations were already leaving.
*   **Anti-Urban Vision:** His preference for car-centric, suburban lifestyles led him to undervalue dense, walkable urban environments.

## The Influence of *The Power Broker*

Robert Caro's 1974 biography, *The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York*, significantly shaped public perception of Moses. Professor Jackson calls it a "stunning achievement" and "the best book I ever read," despite believing it contains "a thousand errors" in its details. He argues Caro's narrative, reflecting the 1970s view of New York's decline, is flawed because it only used Moses's own documents and had a narrow view. Jackson's own work proposes a counter-narrative: "Robert Moses and the *rise* of New York". Moses's own published response to *The Power Broker* was seen as "rambling, wordy, not particular".

The book's cultural prominence stems from its representation of a past era of grand building, its compelling argument, and Caro's writing [[influence_of_robert_caros_book_the_power_broker_on_the_legacy_of_robert_moses | influence of Robert Caro's book 'The Power Broker' on the legacy of Robert Moses]].

## Shifting Perspectives on Urban Development

The approach to urban development has changed dramatically since Moses's time. Today, there's a "crisis where we haven't built significant public works in many American cities for decades" [[economic_growth_and_technological_acceleration | economic growth and technological acceleration]].

### From "Building Big" to NIMBYism and Preservation
The focus has shifted from aggressive construction to preservation and often, opposition to new development (NIMBYism - "Not In My Backyard").
*   It is now "tougher to build in New York City than any other city" due to opposition, density, and expense.
*   Professor Jackson notes, "We don't have the same kind of faith in the future that they did. We kind of like it like it is".
*   The rise of historic preservation means "old is better". This movement, "little known and little supported" in Moses's era, is now very strong, particularly in older cities like New York and San Francisco. An example cited is a 27-story building in Manhattan stalled because its proposed site, a parking lot, was deemed part of a historic district.
*   Modern projects face increased litigiousness and opposition, even for beneficial projects. There is often an "ability to obstruct change".

### The Jane Jacobs Counterpoint
A contrasting vision to Moses's top-down, large-scale approach is embodied by Jane Jacobs [[robert_moses_versus_jane_jacobs_urban_philosophies | Robert Moses versus Jane Jacobs' urban philosophies]].
*   Jacobs famously fought Moses's plans, particularly his view of areas like Greenwich Village as slums.
*   She saw the city as an intricate web of "stores and people living and walking and knowing each other and eyes on the street".
*   While Moses saw a "giant landscape" and a "traffic problem", Jacobs focused on the "intricacies of the city...the block".

## The Future of Urban Development

Looking ahead, cities face new challenges and require ongoing development.
### Current Needs
*   **Climate Adaptation:** For coastal cities like New York, major infrastructure projects are needed to prevent "rising water from sinking the city" [[energy_transitions_and_renewable_energy_challenges | energy transitions and renewable energy challenges]].
*   **Transit:** Further development of underground public transportation is crucial, as cities like New York "simply won't work if you reduce the density or you get rid of underground transportation". Another tunnel under the Hudson River is discussed, though car capacity in Manhattan remains an issue.
*   **Housing:** More housing, particularly affordable housing, needs to be built.

### Prospects for Modern "Master Builders"
Professor Jackson doubts a figure like Moses could achieve the same results today: "I don't think he could do in the 21st century what he did in the middle of the 20th century. I think his bullying methods would work quite as easy today". Systemic reforms are likely needed beyond the influence of a single individual.

### The Enduring Importance of Urbanity
Despite challenges, cities remain vital.
*   Moses did not foresee that people with options would choose city living over suburbs; today, office buildings are being converted to residential units.
*   New York City is the most energy-efficient place in the U.S. due to its density, reliance on public transit, and walkability.
*   Cities like New York and London are predicted to remain "capitals of the world" in 2100, offering cosmopolitan atmospheres, rule of law, and openness to newcomers.
*   The fundamental human desire for connection drives urban appeal: "We are social animals. We want to be with each other". This leads to "urbanity," the "pure joy of being with others".

### Balancing Progress and People
The tension between large-scale progress and individual/community impact remains. Moses argued that his non-elected position allowed him to pursue long-term projects beneficial for future generations, even if unpopular at the time [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. Professor Jackson reflects on the dilemma: "The way we live now, we don't want to hurt anybody. You can't run a city or a country that way. Nothing will change" [[cont](ethical_considerations_and_deployment_of_ai).

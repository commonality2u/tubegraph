Gwern Branwen is an anonymous researcher and writer [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:00]]]. In an in-person interview, his anonymity was protected through the use of an avatar and a synthesized voice, meaning the visual and auditory presentation were not his own, though the words were [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:16]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:23]]]. Branwen discussed the benefits and effects of his anonymity.

## Benefits of Anonymity

When asked about the most underrated benefit of anonymity, Branwen highlighted that it reduces the extent to which people project their own assumptions onto the writer [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:29]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:36]]].

### Reduced Projection and Prejudgment
Branwen stated, "people don't project onto you as much. They can't slot you into any particular niche or identity and write you off in advance" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:36]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:42]]]. This forces readers to engage with the content itself, at least superficially, before forming a judgment: "They have to at least read you a little bit to even begin to dismiss you" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:42]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:48]]].

### Protection from Retaliation
While acknowledging the benefit of protection from retaliation (e.g., swatting attempts or other forms of harassment [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:48]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:58]]]), Branwen considers this secondary.

### Getting a Fair Hearing
The primary advantage, in Branwen's view, is "that you get a hearing at all. You don't get immediately written off by the context" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:00:58]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:01:03]]].

## Public Perception and Role due to Anonymity

The interviewer noted that since people don't know Branwen's face or voice, they can develop an "interesting parasocial relationship" with him [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:33:46]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:33:50]]]. Branwen elaborated on the role he hopes to fill versus the roles he fears he sometimes occupies in the public's perception.

### Desired Role: Mentor and Inspirer
Branwen expressed a desire to fill a role akin to how Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes portray a "Gwern" character: a "mentor or old wizard, offering insight into the situation, and exhorting them with a call to adventure" [[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning | [01:34:05]]]-[[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning | [01:34:21]]]. He hopes his work inspires people to "write stuff and do stuff and think stuff," making them "better people" and aspiring for a better internet [[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning | [01:34:21]]]-[[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning | [01:34:49]]].

### Feared Actual Role: Guru or Devil
Conversely, Branwen fears that he might be perceived as "either a guru or trickster devil" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:34:54]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:35:01]]].
*   **Guru:** He dislikes the idea of being seen as "the god of statistics & referencing who can do no wrong," whose work is taken as "gospel" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:35:01]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:35:07]]].
*   **Trickster Devil:** He also worries about being characterized as a "horrible, covert, malicious, neo-Nazi, eugenicist, totalitarian, communist, anti-Chinese devil figure" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:35:07]]]-[[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [01:35:18]]].

MSNBC's involvement in the "Sleep Deprived" podcast was humorously addressed during one of the episodes, highlighting the fictional nature of these interactions. Despite the jokey tone, discussions around the supposed offer and contract details provided a glimpse into how the podcast engaged with popular media channels and joked about promotional strategies.

## The Fictional Contract

The hosts humorously claimed that MSNBC had signed them for 40 seasons. They stated receiving an email from a "Mr. Peter MSNBC," supposedly the CEO, with a deal where MSNBC would take 70% of the podcast's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This was clearly a comical take, pointing to the absurdity of such a high revenue share, but provided a satirical commentary on media deals.

## Satirical Corporate Communications

Throughout the episode, there was a recurring joke involving phone calls with the fictitious Mr. Peter MSNBC. Hosts mockingly discussed the implications of the contract, indicating that Mika, one of the hosts, was not being paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Furthermore, it was noted that any mention of MSNBC or related topics had to pass a humorous approval or fit the narrative around Peter, the fictional executive.

## Interactive Audience Engagement

The podcast toyed with interactive elements by hypothetically integrating audience agreement or disagreement into the humorous contract framework. The hosts simulated stereotypical corporate feedback loops, stating how Peter was dissatisfied with certain content decisions during the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Jokes on Demonetization

A key aspect of the podcast's interaction with media platforms was its exploration of [[youtube_monetization_and_demonetization_issues | YouTube monetization and demonetization]]. In a comedic twist linked to the supposed contract, it was noted that monetization wasn't a significant concern anymore due to "70% of the revenue" going to Peter MSNBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Humor in Production Language

The producers cleverly used humor as a mechanism to keep the tone light, even while discussing contracts and high-level industry dealings. The parody of corporate agreements and negotiations illustrated the playful dynamic among the hosts and their ability to bring levity to potentially drab topics.

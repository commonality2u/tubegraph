## The Incident

> [!quote] Story Introduction
> Narrated with humor and drama, the incident recounts an encounter with another driver, referred to pejoratively, leading to a discussion about driving behaviors [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=youtube_link&t=00m01s).

The story begins with the narrator driving back from what is humorously referred to as "Moon University," navigating an eight-lane road. The incident revolves around an improper lane turn which almost leads to a collision. A woman, described metaphorically as a "dog of a woman," makes a hazardous move from the left lane of a right turn, causing distress to the narrator in their 2009 Honda Accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12">[02:12]</a>. Despite the momentary anger, it leads to introspection on how to handle such incidents thoughtfully.

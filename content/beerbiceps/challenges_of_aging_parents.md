Dealing with aging parents is a struggle many young adults face, particularly as there's no formal education on how to navigate this phase of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>. The longer one postpones conversations around aging parents, the more challenging it becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

## Parental Happiness and Health
A significant challenge is understanding that for aging parents, their primary source of happiness, relevance, and importance often revolves around their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. As parents reach their 70s and 80s, their health is directly tied to their happiness, which in turn is linked to their offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Their children's activities become their sole identity and what they look forward to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. Many parents' health declines due to an unhappy mental state, potentially because their children are not with them or they are trying to maintain their dignity and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. A major fear among today's parents is becoming dependent on someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Cultural Differences in Care
In Indian culture, the care of aging parents is an intrinsic part of growing up, unlike in Western cultures where children typically move out at 17 and rarely live with their parents in old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. Historically, Indian families, like the speaker's own, might not have physically cohabitated (e.g., sharing a kitchen) to avoid issues, but remained geographically close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. This non-compatibility within family members can negatively impact parental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.

## Emotional Communication
The parents' generation (born in the 1950s and 60s) often wasn't taught to emotionally overcommunicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. This lack of emotional expression, even with their own parents, can contribute to later "daddy and mommy issues" in the current generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. The speaker, therefore, makes a conscious effort to "emotionally overcommunicate" with his parents, actively expressing affection through hugs, even if his father was initially unaccustomed to public displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

!!! quote
"When parents become your parent and you become an adolescent, they stop hugging you because that's the norm, right? And they can't hug anybody else publicly till you have a child. And that's the bond between a grandson and a grandchild or grandchild and a grandparent because it's the only next close thing to blood that they can hug." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>

A parent doesn't hug anyone else publicly until they have a grandchild, which is why they desire grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.

## Supporting Aging Parents
The speaker prioritizes his parents' health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. He believes that the blessings of elders are very powerful and takes extra effort to show affection and respect to all seniors, whether related or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. When facing difficult situations, such as a parent with dementia, one must put on a brave front despite the heartbreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. It's important not to question why these stimuli occur in life, but rather to move along with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Generational Shifts and Understanding
Observing one's parents and grandparents, like the relative who enjoyed the movie *Bagban* (a film about older people disliking how their children treat them), can reveal deeper issues. Even if, from an outsider's perspective, the family seems to have a positive relationship, the older generation might feel a lack of emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. This highlights a shift in expectations across [[cultural_and_societal_changes_across_generations]].

As the current generation ages, they will need to adapt to new realities regarding family life, as the concept of living independently and adulthood has evolved. No one teaches you how to turn 40 or 50, and individuals will find their own unique solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>.

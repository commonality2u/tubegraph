Moisturizers are a key component of a [[Basic Skincare Routine for Different Skin Types | basic skincare routine]] for all skin types, including oily, dry, or regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The choice of moisturizer can significantly impact skin health, particularly concerning acne and the balance of skin bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Natural vs. Chemically Made Moisturizers

The type of moisturizer used is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the use of natural moisturizers over chemically made ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Chemically Made Moisturizers
Chemically made moisturizers can sometimes clog skin pores, potentially leading to increased acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They can also negatively affect the delicate balance of bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The skin contains both "good bacteria" that help fight acne and "bad bacteria" that can exacerbate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Chemically made moisturizers, even if marketed as disinfectants or [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | anti-acne]], may destroy both beneficial and harmful bacteria, disrupting the skin's natural defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Natural Moisturizers
Natural moisturizers are recommended as an ideal alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. They offer benefits without the potential drawbacks associated with chemical formulations, making them a "go-to" option for maintaining healthy skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Recommended Natural Moisturizers

For application of natural moisturizers, it's advised to use clean cotton balls to avoid transferring dirty bacteria from hands to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Rose Water
Rose water is a highly recommended natural disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It can be applied twice a day: once before going out and once at night before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Lime Juice
Lime juice is a stronger option than rose water and should be applied cautiously, no more than once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Its advantages include:
*   Fighting acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Reducing blemishes and fading acne marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

Lime juice may cause a stinging sensation, which indicates it is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If it's too strong, it can be mixed with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Aloe Vera
Aloe vera is considered a "magical medicinal plant" due to its powerful moisturizing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The pulp of the aloe vera plant can be scraped out and applied to the face, often mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Like lime juice, it might cause a slight sting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For extremely dry skin or severe acne, a combination of aloe vera with lime juice once or twice a week can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

These natural moisturizers are considered long-term [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | anti-acne products]] that help improve skin quality by turning towards nature and away from chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas's journey into entrepreneurship began with a fundamental shift in her perspective on work and success. While younger, she observed a romanticization of constant work, with the belief that working 24 hours, doing multiple movies, and sacrificing sleep would lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, through more life experience, she realized the critical importance of [[work_life_balance | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Instead of seeing work as tough and rough, she now views it as a companion, a creative outlet, and a source of joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Her approach involves focusing on multiple "verticals" including her business, production work, books, and acting, while ensuring dedicated time for family and personal activities to return to work rejuvenated and motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## The Genesis of Entrepreneurship

Priyanka Chopra's entrepreneurial journey was influenced by several factors:
*   **Maternal Foresight** Her mother, an entrepreneur and doctor, advised her at age 30 to start planning for the future beyond acting, suggesting production, as the Bollywood industry historically deemed women "too old" after 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This advice was rooted in the perceived "shelf life" of actresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Interest in Business of Entertainment** She developed a keen interest in the financial aspects of entertainment, learning about production costs, profits, and margins from producer friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Venturing into Investments** While working in America, her manager, a venture capitalist, sparked her interest in tech investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. She started with small investments that grew significantly, such as with Bumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

## Impactful Ventures

### Bumble
Bringing Bumble to India was a pivotal moment, as the platform empowered women by allowing them to make the first move, creating a safer dating environment, especially given the challenges women sometimes face in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The expansion of Bumble into tier-three and tier-four cities in India highlights the impact of ideas in new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### Anomaly
Anomaly is Priyanka Chopra's first self-founded brand, developed with the help of partners like Maesa (leaders in incubating new beauty brands) and Nykaa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Her motivation for creating Anomaly stemmed from identifying a "white space" in the market for affordable, sustainable, and high-quality hair care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

#### Anomaly's Unique Selling Points
*   **Sustainability**: Packaging is made from 100% recycled trash, including ocean-bound plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This reduces production costs, allowing for a larger budget for excellent formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity**: The product is designed for anyone with hair, challenging traditional marketing that differentiates between men's and women's hair care needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Clean Formula**: Anomaly products are free from harmful ingredients like sulfates, silicones, and mineral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

The brand achieved significant success, selling one product every 7 seconds on Nykaa on its launch day, and becoming one of the top 10 hair care brands on the platform within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

## Reflections on Entrepreneurship

Priyanka Chopra emphasizes the modern shift in career paths, where traditional roles like doctor or engineer are no longer the only aspirations for the next generation of parents, who are more open to supporting children with new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This aligns with the broader theme of [[youth_leadership_and_entrepreneurship_in_india | youth leadership and entrepreneurship]]. She views her entrepreneurial efforts as building a legacy for her children and future generations, showcasing potential that might not have been previously imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### The Role of Ideas and Execution
She believes in the power of ideas and the importance of working with people who can help execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Her success is not attributed to a "Midas touch" but to relentless effort, a year and a half of research, testing, and meticulous attention to detail from concept to packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This echoes [[advice_for_aspiring_bloggers_and_entrepreneurs | advice for aspiring entrepreneurs]] about consistent hard work.

### Personal Growth Through Ventures
Venturing into entrepreneurship has provided immense joy, comparable to the feeling of making a good movie or a successful podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. It's about finding fulfillment in creation and the satisfaction of seeing an idea come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

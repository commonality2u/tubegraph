Priyanka Chopra has openly discussed her experiences with mental health, emphasizing the importance of seeking support and cultivating self-acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. She acknowledges that everyone faces struggles, choosing to maintain grace and dignity rather than adopting a victim mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Personal Battles and Self-Therapy
Chopra shared that she experienced phases where she felt clinically depressed, particularly after her [[impact_of_upbringing_and_family_on_priyanka_chopras_life | father]] passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This period coincided with her move to a new country, where she had to reintroduce herself in the [[priyanka_chopras_career_journey_and_ambitions | industry]] at the age of 31-32, facing a different culture and being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This transition took a significant toll on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

While she tried going to a therapist, the lack of consistent time prevented her from following through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Instead, she "therapized herself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Her method involved:
*   **Allowing and Accepting Emotions** The first step was to allow herself to feel the emotions and accept the fact that it was okay to feel that way, rather than beating herself up about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Distraction through Work** Initially, she tried to keep her mind busy with work, but she realized this was merely running away from her issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Seeking Support** Chopra found that when facing mental struggles, it's crucial to find support and not deal with issues alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. She relied heavily on her friends during difficult times, choosing to seek out people who cared about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

## Advice on [[mental_health_and_spirituality | Mental Health]] and Social Media
Chopra offers strong advice, particularly for the Indian youth, who often grapple with [[mental_health_and_spirituality | mental health issues]] due to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>:

> "Social media can be good and can be evil. If you focus on the good, the idea of social media was to get people together. It was never to make people feel like they are targeted." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>

She emphasizes that individuals should not succumb to the pressure of public [[priyanka_chopras_perspectives_on_fame_and_public_perception | opinions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Her most significant advice is to find support:
*   Do not keep feelings to yourself, especially if feeling "down, dark, deep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   Find someone to talk to, whether it's a mother, a friend, or someone else you trust; it doesn't always have to be a therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   Many end up in "deep dark places" or take their lives because they believe they have to solve things themselves, which is not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Philosophy from "The Sky Is Pink"
Chopra's film, "The Sky Is Pink," embodies a philosophy that resonates with her mental health approach. The movie's core message, as explained by Chopra, is "Don't let anyone tell you what the color of your sky should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. It's a metaphor for living life on one's own terms and not allowing others' expectations to define personal aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This aligns with her belief that nothing is important enough to cause so much pressure that it defines one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

Chopra encourages adaptability, like water, fitting into any vessel with a sense of calm and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. She also stresses the importance of ambition and the courage to pursue one's glory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Formal dressing, or office dressing, adheres to a few strict yet simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. People's perception of you often boils down to your fashion sense, especially in formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Dressing too casually can lead to not being taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, while dressing like everyone else means you won't stand out or be considered well-dressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These rules are particularly helpful for [[importance_of_dressing_well_for_confidence_in_indian_men | Indian men]] who attend offices or formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## [[traditional_vs_modern_formal_wear | Types of Formal Dressing]]

There are two primary kinds of formal dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:

*   **Traditional Formal Dressing**: This involves very strict rules, especially in old-school offices where fashion liberties are not given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Modern Formal or Business Casual**: This allows for more flexibility and options, letting you play around with the rules slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Rule 1: Shirts

### Traditional Formal Shirts
For a super old-school office following traditional rules, adhere to these guidelines for shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>:

*   **Colors**: Only white, shades of pink, or shades of blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Shades**: Always wear lighter shades for daytime situations like office environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Darker colors are typically for nighttime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Sleeves**: Do not wear half-sleeve shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Patterns & Intensity**: Avoid anything with too loud a pattern or super saturated colors where the intensity is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. In traditional formal dressing, everything should be very subtle and sober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Modern Formal Shirts (Business Casual)
If your office or formal environment allows for modern formal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:

*   **Patterns**: You can wear very subtle patterns, but nothing too eye-catching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Colors**: Prioritize lighter shades, but occasionally you can wear a few darker shades like black, navy blue, brown, or shades of gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These count as modern formal shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These rules mostly apply to new-age offices or formal parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Rule 2: Pants

### Color Selection for Formal Pants
The ground rules for pants involve strict color selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:

*   **Colors**: Black, charcoal gray, navy blue, and some shades of brown (like super light tan, which can be paired with white or blue shirts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Types of Formal Pants
There are two main types of formal pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:

*   **Traditional Formal Pants (Suit Pants or Trousers)**: These are super formal and can be worn in any office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Tailoring**: Always get your pants tailored to be tapered towards the base, making them sleeker and thinner for a leaner, sharper look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Chinos**: A cross between jeans and formal suit pants, chinos are slightly more casual-looking cotton pants that are tight around the thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. While available in many colors, stick to the formal color palette mentioned above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

> [!rule]
> The shade of your pants must always be darker than that of your shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Most attention should go towards your upper body, not your legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Rule 3: Belts

Simple rules apply for belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>:

*   **Material**: No cotton belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Always go for a leather or faux leather belt that gives a leathery feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Color Matching**: Match the color of your belt to the color of your shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It doesn't have to be exact, but it should be similar (e.g., light brown shoes with a dark brown belt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Priority Colors**: Give priority to black and dark brown belts for versatility and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Rule 4: Footwear

For formal footwear, keep these ground rules in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:

*   **Socks**: Match the color of your socks to that of your pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Traditional Shoe Color**: If dressing traditionally formal, the color of your shoes should be either the same shade as your pants or one shade darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Modern Formal Shoe Picks
Top three picks for modern formal shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>:

1.  **Brogues**: Formal shoes with slight patterns at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
2.  **Monk Strap Shoes**: A slightly feminine-looking shoe with buckles, very elegant when paired correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  **Dark Colored Loafers**: A smart option suitable for both parties and the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

> [!important]
> When investing in formal footwear, it's advisable to buy high-quality, slightly more expensive shoes once, as they can last forever if well-maintained and polished at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Rule 5: Wristwatches

Wristwatches are an essential part of formal dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, as no formal outfit is complete without one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Traditional Formal**: A good quality metallic watch is preferred, acting as a power symbol, especially for meetings or super formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Modern Formal**: You can opt for leather-looking straps and slightly thinner dials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid**: Do not wear digital watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, very thick/big/eye-catching dials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, or watches with patterned straps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

By following these tips, you can be the best-dressed person at your office or formal event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Aspects like suits, blazers, and ties are separate topics not covered here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

YouTube personality CarryMina, whose real name is Ajay Nagar, distinguishes between his public persona and his private self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While the character of CarryMina is kept very open and transparent, Ajay Nagar himself remains a deeply private individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Dual Identity
Ajay Nagar views CarryMina as a distinct entity, even referring to it as a "business" that he has built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He maintains that his personal life, as Ajay, is entirely private and something he chooses not to share with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This strict separation is partly because if he were to share one aspect of his personal life, he believes he would be compelled to share more, which he wishes to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Need for Privacy
Ajay describes himself as an introvert who has preferred staying indoors since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His room serves as his "world" â€“ a space where he works, plays games, and relaxes, and it is from this personal space that he has built his significant YouTube presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. His love for [[coping_with_fame_and_privacy | privacy]] means he does not desire any "unwanted things" from others, even though he enjoys meeting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Challenges of Public Attention
A specific challenge related to [[dealing_with_public_attention_and_celebrity_life | public attention]] arises when he is with his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Fans sometimes approach him and speak to him in the same unfiltered language he uses in his videos, which he finds inappropriate in front of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Navigating Teenage Fame
As a famous teenager in India, Ajay faces unique difficulties. He notes that teenagers are naturally prone to making "stupid things" or enjoying parties, but his fame restricts these typical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He misses out on fundamental life experiences like learning to drive or experiencing college life due to a lack of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. His "normal cycle" of growing up, attending school and college, and then working, was broken due to his early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

He sometimes feels he has missed out on experiences, expressing a desire to live in a hostel or flat share to understand college life, not just for personal enjoyment but also to create relatable content for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### The Paradox of Success
Despite achieving remarkable success at a young age, Ajay admits that his dreams are "ending" because he has already accomplished many things he once aspired to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He feels immense satisfaction, having given his "100%" to whatever he creates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Family's Perspective
Ajay's parents are also navigating his fame, experiencing it as something new and learning how to [[managing_fame_and_family_reactions | deal with it]] alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While they have not personally criticized his content, they occasionally remind him about not using offensive language, particularly concerning family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. He also notes that he becomes "so open" during live streams that he forgets his mother might be watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Dealing with Pressure
Ajay states he does not feel pressure from his large following because he has never seen that many people together in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He attributes this to seeing numbers rather than actual faces, which helps him avoid feeling overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. He consciously avoids taking pressure, noting that things tend to go wrong when he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Advice for Growth
Ajay's advice for anyone, regardless of their field, is to always experience new things and never say no to anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He encourages people to step out of their comfort zones, believing that even negative experiences can become amusing memories later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This approach, he suggests, might lead to life-changing discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

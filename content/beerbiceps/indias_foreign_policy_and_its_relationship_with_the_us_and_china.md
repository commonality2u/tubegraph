## India-China Relations
[[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | India's foreign policy]] towards China is complex, with ongoing border issues and significant economic ties. The border situation remains unresolved despite multiple rounds of talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. Despite the tensions, China remains India's biggest trading partner, which is described as "not a good place to be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>.

### Chinese Political Landscape and Economic Model
China's story is fundamentally linked to its rising economy, followed by its political aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. Historically, leaders like Deng Xiaoping advocated for China to "hide their strength and bide their time," focusing on economic progress with rules on presidential terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. The leadership believed that providing a certain standard of living and economic progress would prevent demands for political freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.

However, the current Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has been described as having handpicked his new team based solely on loyalty, leading to a "very dangerous position" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. He is referred to as the "chairman of everything," controlling significant political, military, and economic bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. Xi Jinping is considered irrational, erratic, and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. His anti-corruption purge has resulted in tens of thousands of officials being removed, consolidating his power to a point where no one can question his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

China's current economic situation is described as "very bad shape," with its geopolitical relationships suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. There's a belief that if countries stop buying from China and diversify their supplies, it could be "the end of the China story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>. China spends more on internal security than external, indicating leaders' fear of domestic protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.

### COVID-19 and China's Transparency
Regarding COVID-19, the speaker noted that the Chinese government did not do enough to warn the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>. Questions are raised about why China has destroyed data samples, not given access to laboratories, and what they are hiding if they have nothing to conceal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. The speaker feels that the world deserves to know why it went through the "horror for two years" of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.

### Chinese Expansionism and Predictions
There is a "real risk of war with Taiwan," as China has made it a matter of prestige and aims to do to Taiwan what it did to Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>. While China's diplomacy is toning down from "Wolf Warriors" to a softer approach, the "attempt to power grab and grab land is very much there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>.

The prediction for China in the 2020s and 2030s is that its political thinking will not shift significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>.

### India's Strategy Towards China
[[indias_diplomatic_and_military_stance | India's strategy]] includes building alternatives and diversifying supplies to reduce reliance on China, though this will take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>. The concept of "Atmanirbhar Bharat" (self-reliant India) is seen as an "out and out geopolitical move" to stop relying on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.

## India-US Relations
The relationship between [[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | India]] and the US is currently strong, with India being a "strategic partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. Cooperation extends to areas like semiconductors and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>.

### Historical Context and US Foreign Policy
Historically, the Americans maintained a policy of keeping India "in play" but also "in check," often by promoting Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>. An example cited is the US imposing sanctions on India's ISRO and DRDO in the 1990s for missile development, while "looked the other way" on Pakistan's nuclear network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>. The Kargil conflict was seen as a turning point, after which Pakistan was given less leeway and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>.

The US is characterized as trying to dictate the rules of how the world should be run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:00">[44:45:00]</a>. However, its "superpower status is slowly eroding" because the world is beginning to perceive its "double standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>.

### US Domestic Issues and International Perception
The US faces significant domestic challenges, including high rates of gun violence, where one is "more likely to be killed by a teenager with a gun in the US today than in Afghanistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. The denial of abortion rights to women is described as "taking the country back to Stone ages" and a "huge blot on the US" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>. Issues like racial discrimination against Black people are also highlighted, questioning how the US can lecture others on minority rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.

Despite these issues, the US has immense [[soft_power_and_indias_presence_in_international_media | soft power]] (e.g., NASA, Kim Kardashian) and hard power (military) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>. However, Americans are often described as unaware of what's happening in the rest of the world, leading to a lack of a global worldview, unlike Europeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:26:00">[47:26:00]</a>. There is a general trend that people in developed countries tend to look inwards, while those in the developing world are more aware of international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>.

The speaker expresses that "the West has for a very long time tried to tell us how to be what to eat how to eat how to think what to read maybe we're done with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:53:00">[45:53:00]</a>. The idea that everything Western or American is the "gold standard" is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:09:00">[47:09:00]</a>, particularly regarding applying American social science concepts to unique Indian problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:19:00">[46:19:00]</a>.

## India's Broader Diplomatic Stance
[[indias_diplomatic_and_military_stance | India's diplomatic and military stance]] emphasizes becoming self-reliant (Atmanirbhar Bharat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. This policy is explicitly framed as a strong geopolitical move aimed at reducing dependence, particularly on countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.

India has also worked to strengthen its relationships with Arab states like UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia in recent years, neutralizing the traditional support pockets Pakistan depended on through the "Muslim umah Brotherhood thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. An example of this strategy is India's aid sent to Turkey after the earthquake, described as a "master stroke" in neutralizing Turkish support for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a>.

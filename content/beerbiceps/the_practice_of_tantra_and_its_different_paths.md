[[tantra_and_its_practices | Tantra and its Practices]] is a spiritual path that differs significantly from other spiritual traditions in its approach to reality and self-realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Unlike some philosophies that advocate for rejecting Maya (illusion), Tantra views Maya as the body of the Divine Mother, a constricted manifestation of her being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. The goal in Tantra is to see through this constriction to the larger manifestation of the Divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

Tantra accepts natural human tendencies, including eating and sex, not as something to be rejected, but as elements through which one can find spirituality and ascend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. It proposes using these very things that might cause a person to "fall" to help oneself ascend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. The path emphasizes discipline and specific, disciplined use of these elements, rather than indiscriminate use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

The three most powerful *shaktis* (forces) that govern everything are sex, money, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. A person who transcends these three is considered a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Tantra, distinct from other spiritual paths, considers power itself to be divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. The source of all power is Mahashakti, who governs all power and is personified as Devi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. The aim of an upasaka (practitioner) is to reach the highest power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. [[practices_and_methods_in_tantra | Tantra]] is the method of accelerating an activity to the point of perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

## Paths within Tantra
[[tantric_concepts_and_practices | Tantric concepts and practices]] include a graded form of practice with two primary paths:

### Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path)
This is the initial stage of [[tantra_and_its_practices | Tantra practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. In Dakshinachara, practitioners adhere to rules such as restrictions on food and physical intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. While all mantras, yantras, and tantras can be used, they must be done in a *satvic* (pure, virtuous) manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Any Hindu performing a Puja at home is, in essence, practicing Dakshinachara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. For full [[tantra_and_its_practices | Tantra sadhana]], an initiation (Abhisheka Diksha) by a qualified guru is required to remove obstacles in the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Vamachara (Left-Hand Path)
This stage is entered after mastering Dakshinachara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Vamachara involves the use of *panchatattva* (five forbidden substances), which includes meat and fish, as offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The philosophical basis for this is to challenge the practitioner to attain perfection even in areas traditionally considered "dark" or "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. If the mantra and sadhana are complete, they should work in these contexts as well, demonstrating perfection in both the light and the dark, beyond *satvic*, *rajasic*, or *tamasic* qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

Offerings in Vamachara, such as meat and sanctified alcohol (*karan*), are consumed as *Prasad* (consecrated offering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. This consumption requires strict self-control and is not a license for getting drunk; the practitioner must still be able to perform mantra *japa* and Puja afterward without flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. The *kola* path, a very advanced stage, is to be entered only after lifetimes of [[practices_and_methods_in_tantra | practice in Tantra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. While traditional Dharma Shastras forbid alcohol, Tantra purifies it through mantras and offers it to the Divine Mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Some local practices in Kalabhairava temples, like offering cigarettes or tobacco, are not based on any *shastra* (scriptural authority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Deities in Tantra
The [[the_role_of_deities_in_tantra_and_spiritual_evolution | role of Deities in Tantra and spiritual evolution]] is central.
*   **Mahakal**: This is the highest form of Bhairava, representing time personified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. Mahakal is described as the being at the "Last Frontier of your imagination," capable of taking any shape or form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. Mahakal practices are found in India, particularly among Aghori sadhus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. Meditation on Mahakal can be very fruitful, though it requires intense concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:42">[01:43:42]</a>. The connection to Mahakal can be through the [[tantra_and_its_practices | Tantra Marga]], where Mahakal Bhairava is the consort of Devi Kali, or through a path focusing solely on Bhairava and Mahakal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>.
*   **Bhairava**: This is an aggressive and intense form of Shiva, closely associated with cremation grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>. Bhairava has control over the manner and time of death, and his upasana (worship) can instill fearlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. He helps a practitioner transcend fear of circumstances and life, leading to a state of detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.
*   **Kalabhairava**: The primary form of Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He manifested from Shiva's anger and cut off Brahma's fifth head, thus creating the first *brahmahatya* (sin of killing a Brahmin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. Kalabhairava undertook a penance, carrying Brahma's skull, eventually becoming the guardian of Kashi (Varanasi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:47">[01:33:47]</a>. He sustains, creates, and destroys sins, washing away karmas and accelerating the process of liberation by allowing one to undergo karmic experiences in a brief span of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>. He can "scare death" (*kala* means time/death, *bhairava* means terrifying), implying he makes practitioners fearless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.
*   **Shiva**: Represented as the auspicious, peaceful, and calm form, often depicted with Parvati and their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Philosophically, Shiva is the personification of the static state of realization, detached from the world-creating Shakti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>. The Shiva Purana states there is no difference between Shiva and Bhairava; it is the Maya of Shiva that makes them appear different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.
*   **Devi (Divine Mother)**: The texts state that the Divine Mother is beyond the *gunas* (qualities of nature) and can assume any quality depending on the activity demanded, such as fighting *asuras* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. She is the source of all power, and [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | the Divine is around you]], the first principle of Tantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Reincarnation and the Earthly Playground
The Earth is viewed as a "playground of possibilities" where good and bad, all shades of colors, are allowed to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. This realm offers the fastest potential for spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>.

*   **Lower Beings**: Some humans are reincarnations of beings from lower realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. These individuals may manifest as highly evil figures, such as murderers or serial killers, causing mass damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. They pray to entities that are aligned with their tendencies for quick gains like fame, money, or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. Historical figures like Stalin and Hitler are cited as possible *asuras* (demonic beings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. These entities do not operate by human morality and their purpose is to create evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.
*   **Higher Beings**: Similarly, higher beings can also be born on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>. Their innate capacities, such as musical genius (e.g., Beethoven, Mozart), will manifest to a tremendous degree of perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. However, due to the powerful Maya (illusion) of the Goddess, they may not remember their origins or even lead happy lives, often experiencing adjustment issues with human society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>.
*   **Atheists**: Atheists also have a role in this "playground" as a counterbalance, helping believers to understand faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. From a philosophical perspective, everyone and everything, from the darkest to the purest shades, exists simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. As long as atheists do not obstruct the spiritual practices of others and maintain basic respect, their disbelief is irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:19">[01:53:19]</a>.

## Spiritual Practice and Impact
Every individual contributes to reality at their own level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While some aspects of life may be fixed (e.g., birth and death), daily actions and efforts constantly modify one's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This constant feedback loop is engineered by nature, which is too complex for the human mind to fully comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Dreams can offer insights into different levels of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. While many dreams are subconscious "junk" or reflections of waking reality, some originate from higher astral planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. The rarest dreams come from spiritual planes where deities reside and manifest years later, unchangeable by anything in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

Spiritual practice involves connecting to deities through mantra chanting, which can transform the practitioner and change the deity's perspective towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. This contrasts with simply visiting a temple for *darshan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. The efficacy of spiritual conversations lies not just in the words but in the energy conveyed by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. Such conversations are most fruitful in an environment of receptivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.

The historical application of Tantra can be seen in warfare, such as the Ahom Dynasty's resistance against Mughal invaders, where specific Tantric *vidyas* (knowledge/practices) were potentially used to protect the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Tantra texts explicitly mention the application of spiritual power for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

Improving one's English speaking skills, particularly with confidence, is a common goal for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Ranveer offers five simple steps to improve spoken English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Ranveer's Approach to Language Learning

Despite considering language a personal weakness, English has always been Ranveer's "thinking language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He believes that the tricks he used to improve his spoken Hindi can be applied to English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The core philosophy for learning any life skill, including a new language, is to "make the process easy for yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Unlike conventional advice, he emphasizes enjoyment as the primary driver for successful language acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Five Simple Steps to Improve Spoken English

### 1. Engage with Enjoyable Content

The first step is to engage with content that you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This practice should be consistent, for a minimum of 15 minutes every day, and ideally up to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Three options are suggested for this practice:

*   **Easy Video Content:** Watching cartoons is highly recommended due to their simple language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. If cartoons don't appeal, sports commentary, particularly from commentators like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, or Harsh Bhogle, is another excellent choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The key is to choose video content that you truly enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Audio Content:** If you prefer listening, engaging with radio and podcasts can be very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Simple Reading Material:** Reading simple English texts, such as a 10th-standard ICSE textbook with short stories, can also be beneficial, especially for those who learn better through reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The goal is to discover what works best for you and consistently engage with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This [[the_role_of_observation_and_practice_in_learning_english | observation and practice]] sets the foundation for improvement.

### 2. Observe Sentence Construction

Once consistent practice is established, the second step focuses on observing English as a language from an external perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The emphasis here is not on expanding vocabulary or learning complex words, but on understanding sentence construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

By watching or listening to content, you'll notice how sentences are structured differently from your own thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Every time you identify a difference in sentence construction, make a mental note of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Realize that this isn't how you naturally speak, and consider it a learning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Observe and practice these new constructions by repeating them to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This focus on understanding how English is spoken precedes the learning of new vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### 3. Put Your Ego Aside

The third crucial step involves overcoming the common tendency to associate English proficiency with intelligence, particularly prevalent in Indian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This societal perception can lead to judgment and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Instead of being deterred by criticism, remember that those who mock someone's English are often revealing their own insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[overcoming_the_fear_of_making_mistakes_in_english | Embracing mistakes]] is vital; if people point out your errors, you're likely to remember and correct them, leading to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The focus should be on personal growth and becoming "the best version of yourself," rather than worrying about external opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### 4. Chase Clarity of Thought

Many struggle with speaking English due to concerns about "what log kahenge" (what people will say) and the mental translation process from their native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. To overcome this, the focus should shift to achieving clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Meditation is recommended as a powerful tool to clear the mind and ground one's thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It's believed to help with "absolutely every single life skill," including improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | self-motivation and confidence building]] through mental clarity directly supports fluency.

### 5. Reevaluate the Importance of English

The final point emphasizes the need to [[reevaluating_the_importance_of_english_in_indian_society | reevaluate the importance of English in Indian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The association of English with intelligence is described as a "flaw" stemming from 200 years of British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This mentality is uncommon in other countries where people primarily speak their native languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

It is important to be proud of your own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. If you struggle with English, it's not a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If you get stuck while speaking English, it's acceptable to complete your sentences in your native language like Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

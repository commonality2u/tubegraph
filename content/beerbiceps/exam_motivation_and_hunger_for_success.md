Studying for exams is rarely an enjoyable process for anyone; students worldwide would generally prefer to relax, watch television, or play video games [00:00:26]. However, [[Studying for selfimprovement | studying]] remains a constant necessity in life that cannot be changed [00:00:37]. What *can* be changed is one's perspective towards it [00:00:42].

## A Boxing Match Mentality

Instead of viewing [[Studying for selfimprovement | studying]] as a boring, time-consuming obligation, it can be approached like a boxing match [00:00:47]. Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali famously stated that he "hated every single minute of training," but he told himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" [00:01:06]. This mindset is directly applicable to the rigors of exam preparation [00:01:17].

### The True Opponent

When preparing for exams, your biggest opponent is not another student or an external challenge, but yourself [00:01:29]. Successful students, who may also dislike studying, are not necessarily smarter or more talented than others, but they often possess a greater [[Selfmotivation for future goals | hunger for success]] [00:01:40]. This internal hunger is what one truly needs to cultivate when seeking exam motivation [00:01:53].

## Fueling Your Motivation Internally

True exam motivation should come from within, specifically for the future version of yourself [00:02:21]. Avoid studying for external reasons such as:
*   Parents [00:02:09]
*   Friends [00:02:11]
*   Marks or pay packages [00:02:14]
*   Money or rewards [00:02:18]

The goal is to train so hard that you become confident in your ability to perform well, regardless of the specific questions on an exam paper [00:02:33]. You want to reach a point where you don't have to worry about failing or receiving bad marks [00:02:28].

## Discipline: Choosing the Harder Path

It's common to consider skipping difficult sections or questions, especially when peers do the same [00:02:47]. However, to achieve the best position for your future, you must choose the harder path [00:02:58].

### The Definition of Discipline
[[Discipline and effort in education | Discipline]] is defined as "choosing between what you want now and what you want the most" [00:03:09]. In moments of laziness, when presented with the option to give less than 100%, always choose to give 110% [00:03:16]. This extra effort and [[Selfmotivation and confidence building | motivation]] must come from a place deep within yourself, not from external pressure [00:03:26].

Ultimately, you are studying for your own future [00:03:33]. The choice is yours: be remembered as an average contender who lost battles against yourself, or strive to be remembered as the greatest of all time in your pursuit of [[Improving focus for success | studying]] and working towards your goals [00:03:46]. The overarching rule is "Championship or nothing" [00:03:53].

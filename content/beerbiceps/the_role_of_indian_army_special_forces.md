The [[Structure and selection process of the Indian Special Forces | Indian Special Forces]] represent the pinnacle of efficiency within the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Beyond the well-known Para SF (Army), MARCOS (Navy), and Garuda (Air Force), there are other specialized forces that operate with unique capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Capabilities and Role
Indian soldiers are recognized globally for their potency and capability, able to fight battles and survive on minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The [[Cultural and operational dynamics of the Indian Army | Indian Army]] is considered the "biggest brand and the best brand in the entire world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Special Forces personnel, especially those engaged in combat operations, are primarily focused on counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Their core strengths lie in combat, with training being the second most important aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Operations often involve high mental and physical thresholds, where snap decisions can have life-or-death consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A key responsibility is to ensure that all troops who go on an operation return safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Airborne Forces
Colonel Rajiv Ban, an Airborne officer, highlights that Airborne forces operate "in the air, from the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Their working methodology, reach, and penetration are unparalleled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Every individual in an Airborne unit is capable of exiting an aircraft at speeds of 600 km/h fully loaded with weapons and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. They can operate in various terrains, including jungles, urban areas, high altitudes, and snow-covered peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. Airborne operations require tremendous practice, courage, and a strong heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

Unlike other units where only some individuals might be qualified for combat free-fall or static line jumps, every Airborne soldier can jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. While Para SF has specific roles and a mandated charter of duty, Airborne forces are distinct due to their unique penetration capabilities, which are often "least known the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

### Combat Operations
Colonel Rajiv Ban has been involved in over 100 combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A significant portion of these operations were in FIBUA (Fighting In Built-Up Areas), which is considered one of the most challenging types of military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The difficulty arises from the unpredictable layouts of buildings, varied demographics, and the presence of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. His first firsthand combat experience began in 1999 in Kashmir and then extensively in Manipur during his deputation to the Assam Rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Weapons and Equipment
The choice of weaponry in the [[Structure and selection process of the Indian Special Forces | Indian Special Forces]] is dependent on the specific operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. For instance, in FIBUA with small rooms, a pistol offers more swiftness, despite less accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. In open areas, an AK-47 or 56 is preferred for its stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

Grenades are considered largely ineffective due to unreliability and difficulty in routine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Modern alternatives like the Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) offer superior precision and effectiveness for bunker clearance or engaging targets at long distances (up to 800-900 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### [[Mindset and training of special forces soldiers | Mindset and Training]]
[[Mindset and training of special forces soldiers | Special Forces training]] emphasizes self-sufficiency and survival in extreme conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. This includes being able to consume anything available for sustenance, such as insects, snakes (raw or cooked), or even crocodile meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The training also includes ingesting contaminated water if necessary, using rudimentary filtration methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

The [[Mindset and training of special forces soldiers | mindset and training of special forces soldiers]] are geared towards maintaining composure under immense pressure, as panic can lead to poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. The goal is to act with a strong heart and reflexes, always being prepared for the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

#### Selection Process for Airborne Forces
Selection for Airborne units is entirely voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. Candidates must undergo a probation period and successfully complete a Parachute Course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. There are no specific physical traits endorsed on paper; instead, individuals must prove their worth on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. Any reluctance during training results in a return to their previous unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

Every jump is a unique experience, with differing psychological impacts based on one's position in the aircraft (front, middle, or last) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Commanders typically jump first to lead by example and ensure precision in landing within the designated drop zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The importance of immediate exit from the aircraft is critical, as even a fraction of a second's delay can cause a soldier to land outside the safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Night jumps are considered "more exotic" and beautiful due to the clear view of lights below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

### Significant Experiences

#### Combat in Northeast India
Colonel Rajiv Ban's early experience in Manipur (around 2000-2002) revealed a region where locals questioned if he was from India, highlighting deep-seated animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The situation was so severe that Hindi books, newspapers, and movies were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This environment was fueled by a lack of awareness and exploitation by anti-national elements with political and financial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Many young people were motivated to pick up weapons merely for a sense of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Despite the animosity, he observed that local militant groups had a strong ethical code: they never harmed women, children, or the elderly, and incidents of misconduct were publicly apologized for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Military personnel with their families were considered safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This experience taught him that "the situation in an area is as good or bad as you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, noting that respecting the local population often led to their protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

#### Service in Sudan (2007-2008)
Colonel Rajiv Ban served in Sudan as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force, stationed in a place called Abyei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This region was characterized by extreme poverty, lack of basic resources, and political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. People often resorted to desperate measures for survival, such as drinking cow's blood for thirst or eating boot polish and discarded medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Violence was rampant, with life holding "absolutely no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

In one instance, he had to confront a local militant leader in Abyei after two military contingents had officers and men taken hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Despite the danger, he chose to approach the leader with a small team, opting for a diplomatic approach over force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. He convinced the leader to disperse his armed followers to create a conducive environment for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. This experience highlighted the importance of maintaining composure and understanding human nature, even in the face of sheer "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

He recounts an incident where he defied orders to deny entry to civilians seeking shelter at a gate, including a pregnant woman and an amputee, recognizing the need to prioritize humanity over strict regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. He also admitted to discretely sharing his food and water with starving locals, despite orders forbidding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>. This period profoundly impacted him, making him realize that "dollars is not important," and highlighting the difference between challenges (which are welcome) and suffering (which is painful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

### Conclusion
The **Indian Army Special Forces** embody not just physical prowess but also a deep sense of duty and resilience, often operating in morally complex and extremely dangerous environments. Their training emphasizes adaptability, self-reliance, and the ability to make critical decisions under pressure, upholding humanitarian values even when it means defying direct orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. The "men behind the machine" are paramount, and the Indian soldier's ability to endure and perform without extensive resources is considered unparalleled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. It is asserted that being a soldier is "all by heart, not by uniform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

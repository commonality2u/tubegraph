The Bollywood industry, like many global film landscapes, is experiencing significant shifts in audience preferences and content creation. Actors and filmmakers are adapting to these changes, while also reflecting on past trends and the enduring impact of classic films.

## Evolving Genres and Audience Taste
There is a noticeable shift in the types of films dominating the box office. While action films currently appeal greatly to the audience, the industry notes a decline in other genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Notably, "love stories" or romantic comedies are particularly missed, with a sentiment that the industry lacks the "Shahrukh Kajol moments" of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. There is hope that comedy films will see a resurgence next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Despite these trends, audiences remain open to good storytelling across any genre, provided the content interests them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Impact of Social Media on Stardom and Perception
Social media has significantly altered the landscape of fame and public image. The pressure to maintain a "picture perfect" appearance for events, awards, and promotions is immense, leading to a sense of constant scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Celebrities like [[kareena_kapoor_khans_reflections_on_her_career|Kareena Kapoor Khan]] note that the "art of stardom," which once involved maintaining an air of mystery and creating interest, has largely disappeared in the current generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. This hyper-visibility means that actors have little room for "bad days" or personal emotions in public, as they are expected to be the "perfect star" at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.

While social media has its challenges, it has also become a platform for expression, especially for women. There's a positive trend of more female content creators and girls expressing themselves more on social media, fostering self-confidence and mental health conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## Enduring Influence of Films
Some films transcend their release era and continue to resonate with audiences for years. *Jab We Met* is a prime example, remaining popular on social media platforms like reels and shorts more than a decade after its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The character of Geet from the film is particularly beloved, with people recreating her dialogues and scenes, highlighting the lasting impact of positive and confident characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This enduring appeal is attributed to the character's innocence and decision-making from the heart, which contrasts with modern tendencies to overthink with the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

## The Demands of the Craft
Despite the glamour associated with the industry, the core of acting remains a demanding craft. It requires deep emotional commitment and the ability to convey complex feelings, often regardless of personal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. Performers must be able to tap into empathy to genuinely understand and portray other characters' emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. This level of immersion means that even when personal tragedies or conflicts are occurring, an actor must still deliver on set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

Box office success, while not the sole measure of artistic achievement, is still a critical aspect of the industry. Failures can be profoundly upsetting for actors, leading to introspection and temporary retreats to re-evaluate their choices and wait for the right script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. However, it is often through these setbacks that actors grow and develop a deeper understanding of their craft and aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

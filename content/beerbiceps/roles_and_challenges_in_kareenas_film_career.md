[[Kareena Kapoor Khan's reflections on her career | Kareena Kapoor Khan's career]] has spanned over two decades, starting at the age of 17 and continuing to 43. She considers her biggest asset to be her confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Her journey in the film industry has been marked by hard work, self-conditioning, and sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Passion for Acting and Diverse Roles

Kareena expresses immense love for her job, stating that she has "enjoyed being on set every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. She finds "so much happiness and so much joy" in being in front of the camera, meeting actors and directors, and playing different roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For her, acting is like an "intoxication" that provides a "trans" feeling every time she's on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. She believes that the best acting and art emerge from a deep place of wanting to give one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

She clarifies that not all her roles come from the same place of simply "being Kareena Kapoor Khan," despite popular perception that she makes things look easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. She has invested a lot in roles for films like *Laal Singh Chaddha*, *Heroine*, and *Tashan*, even if they weren't box office successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. She cites Rupa from *Laal Singh Chaddha* as a "deep character" that excited her, being "dark but yet like a ray of sunshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Kareena enjoys playing "grey" human beings, finding them the "most interesting to play" in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Her approach to acting is rooted in her reactive nature, allowing her to convey emotions authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. She doesn't believe in faking confidence, asserting that it's something one either possesses or doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Evolution of Ambition and Role Choices
Kareena notes a significant shift in her ambition from her 20s to her 40s. In her younger years, she had a "different kind of fire" and "hunger" to be the best and constantly be on the go, aiming for "success is everything box office Hit everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. After 25 years in her career, she now seeks a "different kind of hunger," one for "a little bit of peace" and a "deeper understanding" in the characters she plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This evolution stems from her personal growth, particularly influenced by [[The impact of motherhood and family on Kareenas life | motherhood]] and being a wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

She approaches career decisions with her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. While some might criticize her for rejecting certain films, she believes "every film has a destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Her current ambition is to grow as an individual, not to harm herself mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Demands of the Profession

[[Acting career challenges | The acting profession]], particularly for a star of Kareena's stature, comes with unique demands and challenges:

*   **Public Scrutiny:** Actors are expected to perform and be perfect, even when facing personal difficulties like illness or family issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. There is "no room to have a bad day" when in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
*   **Sacrifice of Normalcy:** Growing up in the limelight meant missing out on typical teenage experiences like college, parties, and sleepovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Box Office Pressure:** While she loves her craft, Kareena acknowledges that "box office success is Important" and "numbers matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Handling Failures:** She admits to being deeply affected by film failures, crying herself to sleep on many nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. However, she believes that failures have been more instrumental in her growth than successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.
*   **Industry Expectations:** She notes the immense pressure today to constantly "look hot diva" and adhere to fashion expectations, a shift from earlier times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

### The "Size Zero" Phase
Kareena embarked on the "size zero" look for a film, a challenge she took on to achieve a certain physical transformation for an action film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>. She spent about a year and a half to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Today, she feels that body types are more accepted, and she doesn't need to be size zero for an action film now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

### Maintaining Her "Noor" (Radiance)
Despite the demanding nature of her work and personal life, people often wonder how her "noor" (radiance) remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. Kareena attributes this to a unique balance:
> "I'm at peace with myself... but I'm still hungry for more. I'm satisfied but I'm not. That hunger should constantly be there and there should always be a feeling of like but I can do that. The day that goes away, I will just be like I'm done." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>

She works for her own satisfaction and happiness, aiming to "prove myself to you know I was always going to be this person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Current Projects
Kareena is "very very excited" about her upcoming film *Crew*, an all-female centric comedy heist film, comparing it to an "Ocean's 11" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:72:01">[01:72:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. She feels the audience is ready for female-led heist comedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. She looks forward to doing comedy again after a long time, believing it's what audiences need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. The film *Crew* is set to release on March 29th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## The "Awesome Beer Bicep Sleeve Roll" Method

This specific sleeve roll, often referred to as the "sicker wave," is a popular technique for a stylish finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Steps:
1.  **Grab the Cuff** Take hold of the shirt cuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Pull Up** Pull the cuff upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  **Secure the Cuff** Use the main part of the sleeve to hold the cuff in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

This method differs from the normal way of rolling sleeves in layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Identifying Shirts Designed for This Roll

Many shirts are manufactured specifically to be rolled in this stylish way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. You can identify these shirts if the inner pattern of the sleeve cuff is different from the outside pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. When rolled using this method, the contrasting inner pattern creates two popping elements that result in a gorgeous-looking shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Nora Fatehi, while acknowledging the common practices within the film industry, expresses strong beliefs about [[relationships_and_love | love]], [[relationships_and_love | marriage]], and societal roles. She believes that personal happiness and [[worklife_balance_and_personal_wellbeing | mental health]] should not be sacrificed for career advancement or public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Belief in Love vs. Industry Reality
Nora Fatehi affirms her belief in love, stating that "nothing is worse than getting married to someone that you don't even love and living with them for years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. She observes that many people in the entertainment industry engage in such relationships, often for [[navigating_relationships_and_personal_growth_in_the_film_industry | clout]], networking, or to maintain relevancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. She finds it "crazy" to sacrifice one's [[worklife_balance_and_personal_wellbeing | personal life]] and [[worklife_balance_and_personal_wellbeing | mental health]] for career benefits, viewing it as "almost predatory" when one partner is unaware of the other's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Marrying for Relevancy
> "Nothing is worse than getting married to someone that you don't even love and living with them for years...most of the people in our industry are doing that nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

> "People get married for clout, people use...these wives or husbands for networking, for circles, for money...for relevancy so that I can make sure I'm relevant for the next 3 years because she's got a few films releasing and they were doing well in the box office so I got to ride that wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

## Feminism and Societal Roles
Nora Fatehi openly disagrees with radical feminism, believing it has "f'd up our society completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. She advocates for traditional gender roles, where men are providers and breadwinners, and women are nurturers, wives, and mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. While supporting women's independence and careers, she emphasizes the importance of balancing these with roles in the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The Impact of Radical Feminism
> "This idea of like I don't need anybody and feminism and no I don't believe in this at all. In fact I think feminism f'd up our society completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

> "When feminism becomes radical which is what has happened in the last 15 to 20 years it's dangerous for the society and now the society and people are seeing the repercussion of this radicalization of feminism. Families are suffering, kids are suffering, women's mental health is suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

She cites observations about female physiology and societal structures, noting that modern society's 9-to-5 grind is designed for men's hormonal cycles, leading to burnout for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>. Nora believes that balancing traditional roles will restore societal equilibrium and reduce depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.

## Predatory Behavior in Relationships and Industry
Nora has encountered predatory individuals in various industries, not just Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. She describes predators as those who "sniff out victims" and "scan you and they know your personality" to identify vulnerable or desperate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. She feels her intimidating personality has largely protected her from such advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Women Can Be Predators Too
> Nora distinguishes between sexual predators and "clout predators" who seek to use others for fame or social standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. She also cautions that not all women are "sweet"; many can be "crazy," "conniving," "great actors in real life," manipulative, and emotionally deceptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. She feels that these types of relationships are a form of "act[ing] even off camera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

## Nora's Personal Approach to Relationships
Nora emphasizes the importance of protecting one's aura and spirit, especially for public figures who are constantly exposed to scrutiny, jealousy, and envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. Following a "terrible experience" in a [[relationships_and_love | relationship]], she has created a strong barrier around herself and remains single to filter intentions and protect her [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | emotional wellbeing]] and [[worklife_balance_and_personal_wellbeing | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. She believes in divine love and God, but struggles with trusting humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

### Sacrifices for Career
Nora acknowledges the immense [[lessons_learned_from_family_and_relationships | personal sacrifices]] made for her career, including missing family events, friends' milestones, and not focusing on her [[relationships_and_love | personal life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. She is still "constantly working" and striving for global success, which requires "full undivided attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

### Seeking Balance and Stability
Despite her career ambitions, Nora desires [[relationships_and_love | stability]] in her personal life and wants to be a mother and a wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>. She recognizes the challenge of balancing these desires with her global career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>. She seeks a "right man" who embodies masculine energy as a provider, supporter, and protector, which she believes would allow her feminine energy to flourish and feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

## Insights on Relationships and Personal Growth
Nora stresses the importance of self-awareness and trusting one's intuition to navigate complex [[relationships_and_love | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>. She highlights that maturity and life experiences help in recognizing "predator energy" and filtering unhealthy connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. She believes that prayer and spiritual practices strengthen one's intuition and provide a "shield" and "protection" from negative energies and intentions, especially for public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.

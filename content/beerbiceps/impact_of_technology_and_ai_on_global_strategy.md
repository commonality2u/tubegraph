The modern era, marked by globalization and rapid technological advancement, has profoundly reshaped the landscape of international relations and diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This new environment demands a strategic approach that integrates technological prowess with traditional [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical strategies and narratives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## The Connected World and Globalization

The pervasive use of smartphones has connected individuals globally, leading to increased exposure to global content and comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This digital interconnectedness means that what people eat, read, and think increasingly has a global dimension, embodying the essence of globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## [[The role of AI and robotics in space technology | The Role of AI and Technology in Global Strategy]]

Technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and advancements like quantum computing and semiconductors, is now central to international competition and national strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.

### Pattern Recognition and Data Processing

Dr. S. Jaishankar, India's Minister of External Affairs, likens his diplomatic work to "watching patterns" in interactions with 200 different countries and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>. He imagines a future where AI could process patterns of millions of people, providing a "fantastic edge" in understanding global dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. In this context, each individual becomes a "walking emitter of electronic patterns" through their digital activities, which can be organized into a strategic asset for business, politics, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

### The New "Chip War" and Trusted Collaboration

A significant contemporary challenge is the "Chip War" or "Tech War" centered around semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. Chips are considered the "new oil," highlighting their critical importance in global power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. The focus is on establishing "trusted collaboration" among like-minded countries, typically market economies and democracies that adhere to similar ethical and regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. These nations aim to cooperate to create secure and reliable supply chains for critical and emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>.

## Global Workplace and Talent Mobility

The concept of the "global workplace" is a key aspect of modern foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. This involves opening doors for talented individuals to work internationally, whether in merchant shipping, air travel, blue-collar jobs, or professional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. There is a massive demand for "trusted talent" â€“ skilled and talented individuals who play by international rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>.

India is actively pursuing mobility agreements with countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and the US to facilitate these talent flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. The nature of work is evolving; people don't necessarily need to leave their home country to work for international employers, as services can be rendered remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. This shift is changing traditional notions of "brain drain," as professionals increasingly move in and out of India, taking short-term jobs abroad and returning with new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. There is a growing realization that opportunities in India can be comparable to or even better than those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.

Companies like Apple investing in India, for example, serve as validation of an improved business atmosphere and the quality of available talent, which would not have happened a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>.

## National Competitiveness and Branding

In a world with nearly 200 nations constantly competing, building national strength is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. This includes developing robust industries, fostering entrepreneurship, supporting startups, and enhancing infrastructure (such as smart ports, good roads, and efficient goods movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The goal is to create jobs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

Foreign policy plays a crucial role in marketing and branding a nation globally, making it an attractive magnet for business by demonstrating responsibility and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Pursuing individual excellence in areas like technology and entrepreneurship ultimately contributes to national excellence in the "global sport of geopolitics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.

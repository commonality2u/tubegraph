Sanjay Dutt describes his life as a "rollercoaster ride" that he wouldn't wish upon any young person, acknowledging it as a "difficult life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, he states that Lord Shiva is always looking over him and rescues him from any circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Drug Use
Dutt's initial foray into drug use was driven by a desire to be "in the scene" and "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. He admits to being a very shy and aloof person, especially with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. He thought using drugs made him "a cooler guy with the ladies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. He notes that one to three out of every ten people are addicts, whether it's an addiction to food, gambling, or other substances, and he was one of those few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## Types of Drugs and Effects
Sanjay Dutt engaged in "real hardcore kind of drug abuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, which included not just marijuana or alcohol, but also 'Rin' (likely referring to a type of drug), cocaine, uppers, downers, and 'quaaludes' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. When he was taken to rehab in Miami, he was given a list of drugs and "ticked every one of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. Doctors informed him it was "impossible" for someone to survive the kind of substance abuse he engaged in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

He details the opposing effects of some drugs:
*   **Cocaine**: An upper, it made him talkative and feel like "one of the guys in the crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   **Heroin**: A downer, it caused "winkies" (drowsiness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. To combat the 'winkies', he would use cocaine to stay awake, then heroin again to come down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

His mind thankfully remained intact, but his body also remarkably stayed intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. After returning from rehab, he experienced "flashbacks" for about four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. These occurred because his body would store drug deposits in its fat content, which would then be released, causing a high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Rehab and Recovery
Dutt had to make up his mind to get out of addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Intense drug addiction caused him to enter a "cocoon or shell," making him a loner who didn't want people around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. He spent two years in a rehab center in the Bayou Country swamps of Jackson, Mississippi, which is very rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. He initially struggled to accept that he was a drug addict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

While in rehab, with 30 girls and 40 boys, they engaged in activities like boating and barbecuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. This environment helped him realize "this is what life is" and why he had missed out for ten years, being hidden in his room or bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. This realization marked a turning point for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Addictive Personality
Sanjay Dutt acknowledges having an "addictive personality," a trait that can be diagnosed by a professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. However, he believes this trait can be channeled into positive pursuits like workouts, career, or spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. When he returned from rehab, people initially criticized him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>, but he began working out to "break through that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Slowly, he transformed from being labeled "chindi" (ragged/unimpressive) to a "guy with a swag" and a "cheetah body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>.

## Lessons and Advice
Dutt advises young people dealing with drug addiction that "there's no better high in life than what life is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the true highs come from family (mother, father, brother, sister) and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. He views drugs as merely "escapism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. He encourages people to be strong and "face whatever problems you have in your life head on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

He also stresses the importance of humility and forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. For him, Lord Shiva has always been his "anchor" and source of strength, picking him up and making him stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. He thought about Shiva during his drug addiction phase and later in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

Sanjay Dutt's ultimate advice to kids is to "be strong, listen to your parents, study hard, stay away from drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>. He explicitly states, "Please don't follow my life because it's not a heroic life; it's difficult. So learn from it, but please don't follow it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.

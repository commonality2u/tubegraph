From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Sri M is described as a renowned author and spiritual leader whose life experiences span from encounters with yetis and beings from other realms to profound insights into [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual growth]] and the meaning of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. His journey is presented as a conversation that aims to bend and open the mind, particularly for believers in spiritual phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Spiritual Awakening

Sri M was born into an immigrant Muslim family in Kerala, India, whose forefathers came as security guards to the maharajas of Travancore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:01">[06:01:01]</a>. He considers himself a Keralite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:18">[06:18:18]</a>, born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:26">[06:26:26]</a>.

His earliest significant memory begins around the age of nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. It was then that he had a unique experience: his Guru, Maheswar Babaji, laid a hand on his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This touch triggered memories of his past, including being an embryo, powerless and enclosed in a dark room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. These memories flooded in before suddenly disappearing, leaving him with only the memories of his current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Krishna in the Gita states, "I am the one who gives memories, I'm also the one who wipes it out," a process that happens to everyone, though some discover these memories later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:07]</a>.

### Meeting His Guru: Maheswar Babaji

At age nine, while playing alone in his backyard, Sri M encountered a tall, unusual person with matted hair, very fair skin, and no upper garment, carrying a *danda* and wearing a large *rudraksha* garland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This stranger, Maheswar Babaji, gestured for him to come closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:03]</a>. Babaji asked if he remembered anything, and when Sri M said no, he placed his hand on his head and said, "When the time comes, you will remember everything. Everything will be fine. Go back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

The experience was vivid and not a vision, as he could still feel the warmth of the hand on his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. He tried to tell his mother about it but found himself unable to speak of this specific incident for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### The First Meditation

From that day forward, his life began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. That very night, around midnight, he felt someone waking him up, though no one was physically there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. He felt a warm sensation and a rotating light in his navel, which spread throughout his body, bringing a feeling of blissfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. This was his first [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. This nightly experience continued, leading him to understand many things and develop a desire to read ancient texts like the Upanishads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. His [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] deepened over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

### Encounters with Holy Men and Yogis

As he grew up, situations would arise where he would meet [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | spiritual]] persons, holy men, yogis, and swamis from various places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. He received blessings and instructions, sometimes verbal and sometimes non-verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

One such encounter was with Swami Abhedananda, who lived near the Padmanabhaswamy Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Swami Abhedananda advised him against complex Kundalini practices, telling him that simply chanting the name of God was enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. Another encounter was with Gopala Swami, an advanced Yogi who was a clerk by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. When Sri M was 12, Gopala Swami placed his hand on his head, conveying non-verbal instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

These experiences gradually changed his mind, making him realize that the world was not merely three-dimensional and that there were things far beyond normal perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. He felt a calling to find ultimate happiness and the infinite Supreme, rather than chasing day-to-day desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

## Journey to the Himalayas

At 19, feeling caged by his family's expectations as the only male child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>, Sri M decided to leave home to find a tangible spiritual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. He had a strong feeling that someone was waiting for him in the Himalayas to teach him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. Without Google or maps, he used railway guides to plan his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.

His journey was arduous, facing problems with food and cold, especially after reaching Rishikesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. He stayed briefly at the Divine Life Society, where Swami Chidananda, its head, recognized his wanderlust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. He then embarked on a one-month and ten-day walk from Rishikesh to Badrinath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

During this journey, he met various people, including yogis, wise but simple individuals, and also some cannabis-smoking figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. He recalled meeting an elderly Vaishnava sadhu who warned him about the dangers of renouncing the world without being truly ready, explaining that failure at higher stages of spiritual practice could lead to severe setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

In Badrinath, he met the Rawal (chief priest) of the Badrinath Temple, who discouraged him from seeking yogis in the Himalayas, telling him to go back and continue his education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:03]</a>. Despite this, Sri M stayed in an ashram arranged by the Rawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. Disillusioned by the card-playing sadhus, he walked towards Mana, the last Indian village on the Indo-Tibetan border, hoping to find yogis in caves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>.

### Reuniting with Maheswar Babaji and Intensive Training

Feeling suicidal and contemplating ending his life by jumping into the Alakananda river, he decided to [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. He returned to a *vyas gufa* (cave) where he had seen a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. There, he reunited with Maheswar Babaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>, who greeted him with, "Oh, so after wandering here and there, you come back again to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. Sri M pledged never to leave him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>.

He stayed with Babaji for nearly three and a half years, wandering and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. Babaji taught him what a university might take ten years to cover, all from his own knowledge without books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. Sri M discovered that Babaji was an extraordinary man, knowing his thoughts before he expressed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>.

He learned various schools of Indian philosophy (Darshanas) like Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Vedanta, and Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>. Babaji instructed him to learn everything because he would be given a teaching assignment and would need to understand different fields and scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. His primary practice, however, was Kriya Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.

### Kriya Yoga and Spiritual Advancement

Kriya, in yoga *shastras*, simply means a practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>. The specific Kriya teachings he received came from the lineage of Sri Guru Babaji, not his direct master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>. This Sri Guru Babaji, also known as Mahar Babaji (a term coined by Yogananda Swami), is believed to have existed for a very long time, possibly until the end of the Kali Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>. Kriya is described as a very systematic and methodical way of transcending the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. It is considered one of the fastest forms of [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual advancement]], provided one follows its rules diligently and regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.

Kriya focuses on raising awareness from the gross (physical) to the subtle, paying attention to the spine (*Sushumna*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>. The mind, normally caught in gross forms of energy, is guided through different parts of the spine, becoming finer until it understands the origin of the human substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:06]</a>. After years of practice, Sri M finds enjoyment in it and has had many dimensions open to his mind, allowing him to shift his consciousness to higher levels at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.

### Understanding Divinity and Higher Dimensions

For Sri M, [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | divinity]] is not an external concept like God in Semitic religions, but the divine spark existing within us, the core of one's own consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>.

He firmly states that [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | higher beings]] exist and that it's a limited way of thinking to believe only humans exist on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. Just as we don't see air but it exists, these beings are around us, often encouraging and helping, even if unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>. He compares humans to ants in relation to these [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | higher beings]], unable to conceive of their greater perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:08]</a>.

Regarding [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | ghosts]], he believes they are generally products of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. He explains that when someone dies suddenly, the electric charges in the body, which have acquired the body's shape, are released and wander around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>. These "[[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | ghosts]]" have no intelligence and cannot hurt, only instill fear, and eventually dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.

[[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | Possession]], he suggests, is 90% psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>. While electrical charges cannot possess, in rare cases, other [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | beings]] (not necessarily demonic) can occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>. These [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | invisible beings]] can be good or bad, with good ones influencing minds positively during [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] and chants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. Bad influences, while not necessarily evil, can increase desires (like sexual desires) that are distracting for a spiritual seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>.

He explains that thoughts are not solely properties of one's own mind; they can be infused by external circumstances or other [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:30:00">[45:30:00]</a>. This is why traditional [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] involves drawing a protective mental circle to keep distracting thoughts away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:00">[46:39:00]</a>.

### The Yeti Encounter

One well-known experience of Sri M is his encounter with a Yeti. This occurred during an unsuccessful attempt to reach Kailash, using a route that goes through the Indo-Tibetan border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. He developed a high fever and was delirious in a tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

He woke up to find his temperature lowered and felt slightly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Suddenly, a huge, furry, human-like person entered his tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The first thought was that it was a bear, but it stood like a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. It made an eerie, whistling sound and then stuffed a bitter herbal medicine into his mouth, which he swallowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. The creature then ran away as Babaji came in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.

Babaji later confirmed it was a Yeti, stating that without the herbal medicine, Sri M would have died from the mountain fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. Babaji emphasized that Yetis are "good people," not to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Sri M did not clearly see the Yeti's face in the dark but noted it was broader and bigger than a human face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>. He smelled something like a furry animal but felt nothing else from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. This experience taught him that living creatures exist in remote parts of mountains and forests that humans do not often see or believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

### Kundalini and Enlightenment

Sri M prefers to avoid the term "Kundalini" due to its exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. He defines it as the entire energy of the universe, described as "Parashakti" in the *tantras*, a feminine creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. This energy initially operates as sexual energy, creating new life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

Yogis, instead of allowing it to dissipate in the sexual field, control it and make it ascend the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. When it ascends, Kundalini transforms into a spiritually creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. Kriya is one practice to turn this energy around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

He cautions that Kundalini awakening should be slow and deliberate, as a sudden release of such powerful energy without preparation can lead to mental instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. He expresses concern about teachers who provide techniques without proper preparation and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

According to yoga *shastras*, *moksha* (liberation) or *gyana* (enlightenment) generally occurs when the energy rises to the Sahasrara chakra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. However, he acknowledges that some people achieve illumination without specific Kundalini or yoga practices, through purification of the mind over many lives, where the energy awakens in other centers like the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

## Dimensions and Time

Sri M delves into the concept of Shiva (Shivam), not as a deity but as an abstract concept representing the ultimate essence of all dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. The "third eye" in Shiva's depiction symbolizes a special faculty needed to understand concepts beyond ordinary dimensions, meaning our current senses limit our perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Only when other sensory perceptions beyond the ordinary open up can one begin to grasp the next dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.

He uses an analogy of wafer-thin beings in a transparent box, only able to perceive two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. They cannot comprehend moving "up" to cross a vertical barrier. Similarly, humans are limited to three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. One way to reach out to other dimensions is by sitting quietly and still, engaging in [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] until one is "lifted" from the ordinary dimension to something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. This is because truth is not linear; it is "Here, There, and Everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Time, for Sri M, is based on change; without change, there is no time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. It is a relative and psychological concept, as an hour can feel long or short depending on engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. He uses the example of a mosquito's two-day lifespan feeling like an entire lifetime to itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. Going beyond time means understanding it, realizing that clock time is not the real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. This life is neither the beginning nor the end, continuing until one consciously chooses to stop it by realizing its endless and useless nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.

### Pineal Gland and Enlightenment

He advises against relying on substances like Ayahuasca or DMT for enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. While they can temporarily show that things exist beyond the ordinary mind, they don't lead to lasting development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

Regarding the pineal gland, he notes its recent popularization as a "spiritual organ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. He acknowledges its biological function in regulating the circadian rhythm and releasing melatonin, which induces sleep and feelings of bliss during deep [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. Through yoga, one can consciously control the release of these hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.

In Vedanta, the *Mandukya Upanishad* describes states of consciousness: waking, dream, deep sleep (*Shusupti*), and *Turiya* (beyond definition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. The pineal gland is linked to deep sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. The fine line between deep sleep and *Turiya* is where one can, theoretically, become aware of the bliss experienced in deep sleep, thus entering *Turiya*, an "everlasting state of blissfulness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>. This transition can be facilitated by focused attention on the pineal gland area, calming the mind, and equalizing the breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. He references the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6 (*Dhyana Yoga*), where Krishna advises Arjuna to sit straight, keep spine and head steady, fix attention between the eyebrows (the *Bhrumadhya* or pineal gland area), balance breath, and be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Nagas

Sri M is reluctant to discuss Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>, but explains that the hooded serpents we see today are "decadent leftovers" of an ancient species of [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | beings]] that lived in another realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. These ancient Nagas were teachers of humanity and are worshipped as symbols of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. The Kundalini itself is also considered Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>.

The original Nagas disappeared, returning to their realm called Nagaloka, because they started having relationships with human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>. The cobras of today, while not as intelligent as their ancestors, are more intelligent than other snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. Cobras do not bite unless threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>, and they respond to vibrations rather than sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>. Notably, cobras recognize individuals in whom the Kundalini is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>. Sri M had a rare encounter with one of these ancestral Nagas in the Arunachala caves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

## Life's Purpose and Future of Humanity

After three and a half years with his Guru, Babaji instructed Sri M to return to the world, get married, settle down, and teach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. This was to experience the life of an ordinary human being, which he needed to understand to be an effective teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Babaji also told him not to teach until he received a green signal, which meant he did not teach until he was 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. During these years, he continued his Kriya practice and re-learned his knowledge to prepare for teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

Sri M's purpose in life is to make people understand that a divine element exists in every living being, especially humans, who can recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>. The aim of life is to turn the mind inward and find this divine essence, expanding from the ordinary to that which is beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.

He believes the human race must continue to evolve beyond its current frontal lobe civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. He advises young people to maintain the [[spirituality_and_meditation | spiritual]] aspect of life, even while pursuing other endeavors, as it is crucial for ultimate [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.

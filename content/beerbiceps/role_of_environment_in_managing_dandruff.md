Managing dandruff effectively requires attention to one's immediate environment, as dandruff is considered an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. Even when using anti-dandruff products, dandruff can persist if the environment remains "dandruff-infested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:04">[02:58:04]</a>.

## Cleaning Your Environment

To prevent the recurrence of dandruff, it is crucial to clean items that frequently come into contact with your scalp. The general rule is to wash "anything that comes in contact with your scalp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>.

### Pillowcases
Pillowcases should be cleaned regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>. To properly sanitize them, take your pillowcase off the pillow, dip it in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water), and leave it in the solution for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:08">[03:02:08]</a>.

### Hair Tools
Combs and brushes used on your hair should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:05">[03:16:05]</a>.

### Headwear and Accessories
All types of head gear, including caps, hats, and helmets, must be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>. The same cleaning practice applies to any hair bands or hair clips that touch your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:06">[03:27:06]</a>.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas discusses her evolving perspective on [[balancing_career_success_and_personal_wellbeing | work-life balance]] and personal happiness, contrasting her younger ambition with her current approach to career and life choices.

## The Evolution of Work Ethic

Initially, Priyanka Chopra Jonas romanticized the idea of relentless work, believing that working "24 hours," doing "four movies at one time," and enduring "five shifts" without sleep or food would lead to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective was common, suggesting that the more a person pushed themselves, the more successful they would become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

However, with more life experience, she realized the critical importance of [[balancing_career_success_and_personal_wellbeing | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. She now understands that work does not inherently need to be "tough and rough"; instead, it can be a "companion," a "creative" outlet, and a source of "joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Prioritizing Personal Time

A recent trip to Turks and Caicos exemplifies her current approach. During this vacation with her husband, phones were turned off, and they spent time walking on the beach and collecting shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This period of disconnection led her to return feeling "rejuvenated," "excited," and "motivated" to advance her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Her current philosophy is to work on her multiple verticals (business, production, acting, writing) but to completely switch off when with family or at home, enabling her to return to work with greater focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Personal Happiness and Growth

Priyanka Chopra Jonas describes herself as "happier than I've been in a really long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This contentment stems from:
*   Maturity and being on the "other side of 35" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Having a more stable foundation in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   No longer "running as fast as I was," and instead, thoughtfully considering her steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Making choices that are her own, free from the need for external validation that she sought when younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The host, reflecting on her continued drive for success, queried whether such ambition comes with a "trade-off of [[mental_health_and_lifestyle | mental health]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Priyanka's response emphasizes the importance of balancing hard work with personal well-being.

## The Meaning of Life and Success

For Priyanka Chopra Jonas, the meaning of life lies in "having purpose" between birth and death, viewing what one does in that interim as their "legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>. She clarifies that "success is very subjective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>; her definition of success may not align with someone else's idea of an ideal life, such as living in a shack on a beach, meditating, or becoming a monk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

She encourages individuals to define their own purpose and make choices that bring them peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

### Advice for the Younger Self and Others

She advises her younger self not to have "stressed out so much" about losing her job, position, or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This anxiety is common, especially among younger generations who fear "getting too old" even at 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. She emphasizes that aging is a natural process, and attaching excessive importance to it is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. What truly matters is "what you do about your life in the moment right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

Priyanka also stresses the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences:
> "Do not hang around with poisonous people, do not keep people around you that are toxic, that mess with your brain. Keep people around you that are genuinely happy with happy for you. Only people that are genuinely happy for you, and whether if that's two people, you're a rich person." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>

She believes in focusing on the "one person that believes in you" and the "little sliver of light" for inspiration, rather than dwelling on those who try to pull you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. This requires an individual's internal fight and self-motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

### Achieving Dreams: Small Steps

While some believe in vision boards and "the secret," Priyanka finds that focusing on "the small next dream" or "the next step" is more effective for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. She advocates for working backward from a goal, taking one achievable step at a time, rather than waiting for miracles to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Priyanka emphasizes that true success and "gold" are not handed out but are the result of consistent "work" and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. She highlights the year and a half of research, testing, and meticulous planning that went into her brand, Anomaly, as an example of this effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

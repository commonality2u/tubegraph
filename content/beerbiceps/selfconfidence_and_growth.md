[[personal_growth_and_selfexploration | Personal growth and self-exploration]] and [[building_selfconfidence_and_internal_happiness | building self-confidence and internal happiness]] are continuous journeys, marked by evolving perspectives on life, work, and personal fulfillment. Priyanka Chopra's reflections highlight a shift from a romanticized view of relentless work to an emphasis on balance, inner peace, and defining success on one's own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Evolution of Work Ethic and Life Balance
Priyanka Chopra recalls a younger perspective that glorified working "24 hours," "don't sleep, don't eat," believing it directly correlated with success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, with more life experience, she realized the crucial importance of work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Taking breaks, like a recent trip to Turks and Caicos with phones off, left her feeling "rejuvenated," "excited," and "really motivated to take my career forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. She now views work as a "companion" that can bring "joy" rather than being "tough and rough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Maintaining this balance allows her to return to work with focus and increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Personal Maturity and Contentment
As she has matured, particularly past 35, Chopra has reached a place of greater happiness and contentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This shift is attributed to no longer "struggling with the things that I did when I was younger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. She is now on "more stable ground" and makes choices defined by herself, rather than seeking "validation that I probably needed when I was younger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This personal growth has fostered a sense of calm and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Building Resilience
Chopra's journey in the American entertainment industry showcases her resilience and humility. Despite a successful career in India, she "started from scratch" in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This involved walking into rooms with "extreme humility," introducing herself, and taking small roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. It took her 10 years to secure a leading role in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

> [!quote] On humility and hard work
> "It required me to strip every single thing that I knew in India and The Laurels that I had achieved in India... It required me to walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself to people... I had to swallow the humility pill and I was willing to do that hard work and then 10 years later I finally got my leading role in a movie." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>

She emphasizes that success is not instant but requires consistent effort, auditioning, and adapting to a new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

## Dealing with Negativity and External Criticism
[[overcoming_criticism_and_selfimprovement | Overcoming criticism and self-improvement]] is vital for sustaining [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | self-motivation and confidence building]]. Chopra acknowledges that in India, there can be a tendency for people to feel jealous or envious of others' success rather than supportive, attributing this to historical colonial influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. She has also faced individuals trying to jeopardize her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

> [!quote] On overcoming negativity
> "You have to shut off the noise. There are many people that'll want to pull you down but don't focus on that. Focus on the one person that believes in you, focus on the light, little sliver of light that you might see, a little bit of inspiration that you might see, and that's the hardest thing to do because you're bogged down by baggage, you're bogged down by shackles of people holding you down so you have to really push forward and that's just individual. Do you have that inside of you to fight that fight for yourself or are you going to wait for somebody else to do it? That's an individual choice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>

She advises against dwelling in negativity, as it can lead to becoming "dark and negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. For [[relationships_and_personal_growth | personal growth]], she stresses the importance of surrounding oneself only with "champions" who are "genuinely happy for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Redefining Success and Purpose
Chopra defines the meaning of life as "having purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. She believes "what you do in between birth and death is your legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Success is subjective, and while some may aspire to simple lives, her purpose involves continued creation and leveraging her privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Instead of focusing on "unachievable dreams" or waiting for "miracles," she advocates for setting small, achievable next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. By working backward from a goal and taking incremental steps, one can slowly build a legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

## Self-Acceptance and Growth Through Aging
Addressing common anxieties, Chopra advises her younger self not to have stressed so much about losing her job or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. She highlights that aging is an inevitable fact of life, and there's no need to put "so much equity on age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. What matters is "who you want to be" at any given age and "what you do about your life in the moment right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

> [!quote] On aging
> "Aging feels really nice... Why are we putting so much equity on Aging, that's the one thing we know that is going to happen, what is the stress around it? You're going to get older." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>

This perspective promotes [[perception_of_personal_flaws_and_selfacceptance | self-acceptance]] and empowers individuals to pursue their goals regardless of age, citing examples like Falguni Nayar starting Nykaa at 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## Importance of Gratitude and Inner Drive
Chopra maintains a strong sense of gratitude for her life, her parents, and the agency she has to make her own choices, a privilege many women around the world do not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This gratitude fuels her desire to "give back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

> [!quote] On inner empowerment
> "If you want to be the lead actor of the of your movie, which is your life, you've got to take choices that might be contrary to what you've heard... and that empowerment may or may not come from your parents, may or may not come from your family or boyfriend or whoever you're around. It comes from you and that no one can do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>

For those lacking external encouragement, she advises finding that "encouragement in your gut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. She emphasizes drawing inspiration from others and actively working to achieve similar feelings of accomplishment, rather than passively observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This highlights a blend of [[personal_development_through_spiritual_discipline_and_selfcare | spiritual discipline]] (through prayer and gratitude) and a proactive approach to [[overcoming_selfdoubt_and_building_selfconfidence_in_young_entrepreneurs | self-confidence building]].

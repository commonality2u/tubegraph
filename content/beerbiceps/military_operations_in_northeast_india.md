[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Rajeev Bharwan's]] early [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | military operations]] tenure included extensive involvement in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism activities across Assam, Manipur, and Nagaland [00:04:23]. These experiences largely centered around direct "action" and combat situations [00:04:35].

## Early Combat Experiences
[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] estimates having been involved in over 100 combat situations [00:05:48]. His combat journey began in 1999, first with his unit in Kashmir and then with his first major posting in Manipur [00:07:09]. A significant portion of these operations were in [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | Fighting in Built-Up Areas (FIBUA)]] [00:06:00]. This type of operation is considered one of the most difficult due to the unpredictable nature of urban environments, where every house has a different layout, and the diverse demography [00:06:04].

His first life-threatening combat experience occurred in the Northeast during a FIBUA operation [00:10:22]. Upon entering a house, he found someone pointing a weapon directly at his head [00:10:42]. Luckily, the weapon malfunctioned, allowing him to regain his senses and subdue the individual [00:11:31].

## The Situation in Manipur
During [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan's]] posting in Manipur around 2000, as the youngest officer in the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Assam Rifles]] at age 24-25, the situation was severe [00:08:06]. Civilians there would even ask if he was "from India" [00:08:18]. Hindi books, newspapers, and movies were banned, indicating a "parallel government" run by various groups [00:08:35]. This animosity stemmed from a lack of awareness among the populace, exploitation by anti-social elements, and the pursuit of political power and money by militant groups [00:08:57]. Many young people were motivated to pick up weapons simply for a sense of power [00:09:38].

## Lessons Learned from Manipur
[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] learned three key lessons from his time in Manipur:

1.  **From the [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | Military]] Perspective**: The [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Assam Rifles]], known as the "Sentinels of the Northeast," impressed him as a highly effective force. They represent a "mini-India," with personnel from diverse regions speaking multiple languages (including fluent Nepali) and sharing common habits [00:13:00]. The experience of jawans (soldiers) who serve until age 60 provides invaluable combat and logistical knowledge, eliminating the need for maps or GPS in familiar areas [00:13:38].
2.  **From Militant Groups**: Surprisingly, some militant groups in Manipur operated with a strong ethical and moral code of conduct [00:15:16]. They would publish apologies in newspapers if their members committed wrongdoings against the public, and they never harmed women, children, or elderly people [00:15:25]. Military personnel with their families were also considered safe [00:16:01].
3.  **From the Public**: Treating local people with respect, particularly the elderly, women, and children, ensured safety and cooperation [00:16:34]. [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] recounts participating in local dances and attending marriage functions in remote areas at night without a weapon, relying solely on the trust extended by the locals [00:16:56]. This highlighted that the situation in an area is often a reflection of how the forces interact with the populace [00:17:35].

## Situation in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K)
[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] advises audiences against relying solely on media portrayals of Kashmir, emphasizing the difference between "reel life" and "real life" [00:18:36]. He suggests visiting J&K as a tourist, especially with family, to experience the ground reality and the omnipresence of security forces [00:19:01]. He notes that the revocation of certain sections (presumably referring to Article 370) has significantly eased the military's task and is leading to improvements in the region [00:19:47].

[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] recalls a time in Srinagar when signs reading "Indian Army and Dogs are not allowed" were prevalent [00:20:11], and Pakistani flags were openly displayed [00:20:56]. He recounts instances where routes were blocked while trying to transport fallen soldiers [00:20:31]. Today, he observes a significant change, with the Indian flag (Tiranga) flying at Lal Chowk and the suppression of agencies that caused disruption [00:21:05]. He believes the environment is gradually improving, although it takes time [00:21:16].

## Weaponry in Operations
[[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] describes grenades as "useless" in his experience, often malfunctioning or not detonating as expected [00:21:49]. He explains that grenades have a specific "killing zone" or template, typically a few meters in diameter, beyond which splinters cause no damage [00:23:46]. Grenades are primarily trained for use against hidden targets in open ground or for bunker clearance, but modern alternatives like Automatic Grenade Launchers (AGLs) offer superior precision and range [00:24:28].

Regarding [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | Indian military]] weaponry compared to foreign militaries, [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] asserts that while equipment profiles vary by unit (e.g., RR, [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process | SF]]), the "biggest brand and the best brand in the entire world is [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | Indian Army]]" [00:28:58]. He states that [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | Indian soldiers]] are uniquely potent and capable, able to fight battles "just surviving on water, jaggery, and makhana" [00:29:09]. He emphasizes that it is the "men behind the machine" who are the best [00:30:08], citing examples of their unparalleled endurance, mental fortitude, and dedication to duty, even sacrificing their lives for the nation [00:29:21].

For close-quarters combat in built-up areas, [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | Colonel Bharwan]] preferred carrying a pistol for swiftness, despite its lower accuracy and significant recoil [00:27:17]. For more open areas, an AK-47 or 56 was preferred due to its stability [00:28:07]. Every [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | military]] unit has a specific weapon and equipment authorization based on its role [00:28:20].

[[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Rajiv Ban]] has extensive experience in [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military operations]] within Northeast India, serving in regions such as Assam, Manipur, and Nagaland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. His combat journey in the region began in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Combat Experience and Challenges
[[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] estimates he has participated in over 100 combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The majority of these operations were in FIBUA (Fighting in Built-Up Areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These built-up areas, similar to cities like Mumbai with tall, unstructured buildings, are considered among the most difficult environments for [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military operations]] due to varying layouts of houses and dense populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Manipur is cited as a prime example of such an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### First Combat Experiences
[[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]]'s first raw combat experiences occurred during his posting to Manipur, where he was deputed to the Assam Rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. At that time, there were two to three combat opportunities daily, often followed by additional operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He was one of the youngest officers in the Assam Rifles, around 24-25 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

During an early operation in the Northeast, while clearing a house, [[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] faced a life-threatening situation where an insurgent pointed a weapon at his head upon entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The weapon misfired, allowing him to react and overpower the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This incident highlighted the unpredictable nature of FIBUA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Situation in Manipur
The situation in Manipur during [[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]]'s posting was dire, with civilians questioning if he was "from India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hindi books, newspapers, and movies were banned, and an "unparallel government" run by militant groups held sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This animosity stemmed from a lack of awareness and exploitation by anti-national elements and political groups seeking power and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Young people were easily motivated to pick up weapons for a sense of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Key Learnings from Manipur
[[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] gained three significant insights from his time in Manipur:

1.  **[[cultural_and_operational_dynamics_of_the_indian_army | Military Perspective - Assam Rifles]]:** The Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinels of the Northeast," are a highly potent force comprising individuals from across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. They speak multiple languages, including Gorali and Nepalese, and share common eating habits, allowing them to operate smoothly anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Their jawans serve until age 60, providing them with up to 40 years of invaluable experience, making them "walking encyclopedias" of local terrain and threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. They could provide detailed information on routes, travel times, potential threats, and past incidents without needing maps or GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

2.  **Militant Code of Conduct:** Unlike other conflict zones, militant groups in Manipur adhered to a strong ethical and moral code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. They would apologize publicly for any wrongdoings by their members, conduct inquiries, and publish decisions in newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. They never harmed ladies, children, or elderly people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Soldiers and officers with their families were considered "walking insurance policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

3.  **Public Interaction:** Treating locals with respect, particularly the aged, women, and children, ensured safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. [[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] participated in local dances like Tangal Chomba and attended marriage functions in remote areas at night without carrying a weapon, trusting the locals who invited him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. He learned that the situation in an area is largely reflective of how one interacts with its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Weaponry and Tactics
In FIBUA scenarios, [[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] preferred carrying a pistol for its swiftness in small rooms, despite its lower accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. For more open areas, he preferred the AK-47 or 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. He considers grenades to be "useless" and "literally useless," as they often fail to detonate reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Modern alternatives like the Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) provide more effective and precise results for bunker clearance or hitting targets at long distances (up to 800-900 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

Despite differences in weaponry compared to foreign militaries, [[Major Vivek Jacob's tenure and experiences in the Indian Army | Colonel Ban]] asserts that the [[cultural_and_operational_dynamics_of_the_indian_army | Indian Army]] is the "biggest and best brand in the entire world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. He emphasizes that Indian soldiers are uniquely potent and capable, able to fight battles "surviving on water, jaggery, and muana" (a type of local food), demonstrating unparalleled endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. The strength lies in the "men behind the machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

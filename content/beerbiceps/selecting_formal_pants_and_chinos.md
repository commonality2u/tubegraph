When it comes to formal or office dressing, selecting the right pants is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Your choice impacts how you are perceived in formal environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Color Selection

Strict adherence to color selection is a ground rule for formal pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
Recommended colors include:
*   Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Charcoal gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   Navy blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Some shades of brown, such as super light tan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> (which pairs well with white or blue shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>)

A very important rule for any formal outfit is that the shade of your pants must be darker than that of your shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This ensures that attention is drawn more towards your upper body rather than your legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Types of Formal Pants

There are two primary kinds of formal pants to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:

### Traditional Formal Pants (Suit Pants or Trousers)
These are considered "super formal looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. They are suitable for absolutely any office environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

#### Fit and Tailoring
Traditional formal pants should always be tailored to be tapered towards the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The bottom of the pant should be sleek and thin, contributing to an overall leaner feel and a sharper fashion perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Chinos
Chinos are a versatile option, considered a cross between jeans and formal suit pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. They are slightly casual-looking cotton pants that are typically tight around the thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While chinos come in many colors, it's recommended to stick to the formal color palette for office or formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

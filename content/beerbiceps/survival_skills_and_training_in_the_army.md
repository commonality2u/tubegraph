[[Military training and preparation | Military training]] and [[survival_instincts_and_training_in_extreme_circumstances | survival skills]] are fundamental to an army personnel's ability to operate effectively in diverse and challenging environments. Personnel are trained to be at their mental and physical threshold in combat situations, making snap decisions that can determine life or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A key responsibility for leaders is to ensure that all troops who go into an operation return safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Combat Training and Adaptation
Colonel Rajiv, an experienced officer, identifies combat and training as his primary strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. His career has primarily involved counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in regions like Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Fighting in Built-Up Areas (FIBUA)
One of the most challenging types of operations is "fighting in built-up areas" (FIBUA), such as those encountered in Manipur or Jammu & Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This is difficult because every building has a different layout, making predictability impossible, unlike structured environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Weaponry and Tactics
The choice of weapon depends on the operational requirement and environment. For close quarters in built-up areas, a pistol is preferred for its swiftness, despite its lower accuracy compared to other weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. For more open areas, an AK-47 or 56 is favored due to its stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Grenades are considered "useless" by some due to their unreliability and infrequent use in routine operations, often failing to detonate on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Modern alternatives like the Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) offer superior precision and effectiveness for bunker clearance or engaging targets at greater distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Elite Military Units
### Assam Rifles: "Sentinel of the Northeast"
The Assam Rifles are lauded as a highly potent force, capable of operating with "great smoothness in any part of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. They embody a "mini-India" with diverse personnel speaking multiple languages, yet uniformly communicating in Gorakhali and Nepali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The experience of personnel, particularly Jawans who serve up to 60 years, is invaluable, providing professional advice in combat situations and acting as "walking encyclopedias" for terrain and threat assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Airborne Forces
Airborne forces specialize in operations from the air, demonstrating unparalleled reach and penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Every individual in an Airborne unit is trained to jump from an aircraft at high speeds (e.g., 600 km/h) with full combat load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. They are prepared to operate in diverse and extreme environments, including jungles, urban areas, high altitudes, and snow-covered peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. [[Survival instincts and training in extreme circumstances | Airborne operations]] have the highest casualty rates, with a calculated percentage of personnel not expected to make it during jumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Jumps are particularly demanding, requiring swift exits from the aircraft to land within the designated drop zone, as even fractions of a second delay can lead to a missed target or put lives at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

#### Volunteering and Training
Selection for Airborne units requires individuals to volunteer and undergo a rigorous probation period, followed by a parachute course. Any individual unwilling or unable to complete these requirements is not permitted to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Physical traits are not formally endorsed on paper, but a person must prove their worth and capabilities on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

#### Night Jumps
Night jumps are considered "exotic" and offer a beautiful view of lights from above, but they are also a test of reflexes and mental strength due to the unknown nature of the landing area and minimal reaction time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. A harrowing incident during a night jump saw three soldiers die when their static line cord broke, preventing their parachutes from deploying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. To counter the fear factor and maintain unit morale, the remaining soldiers immediately boarded aircraft and jumped again the same night, demonstrating that "things happen" and are "part and parcel of this job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Extreme Survival Skills
### Sustenance in the Field
[[Survival instincts and training in extreme circumstances | Military training and preparation]] includes being prepared for extreme conditions where food and water are scarce. Soldiers are taught to drink muddy or contaminated water by creating organic filters with mud, sand, stone, and charcoal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. The mindset is that "anything that walks, crawls, creeps, or flies can be eaten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Soldiers in training are compelled to eat what is available, regardless of personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. This includes eating raw snakes and insects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. Snails are described as "tasteless" but a necessary food source in extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Crocodile meat is noted to be flavorful, even better than chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

### Mental Resilience
The experience in areas like Sudan, where people suffered from extreme poverty, violence, and scarcity of basic necessities, highlights the importance of mental fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. Witnessing such suffering can be more difficult than facing direct challenges in operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. Despite strict orders not to provide aid to locals, Colonel Rajiv often secretly shared his own food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. He emphasizes that being a soldier is "by heart, not by uniform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>, underscoring the [[Mental and spiritual aspects of being a soldier | moral and ethical dimensions of service]].

## [[Military experiences and storytelling | Storytelling]] and Legacy
The podcast aims to share [[personal_anecdotes_and_survival_stories | military stories]] and perspectives not typically seen on mainstream platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. These narratives often involve extreme scenarios, like people eating boot polish or cattle urine to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. The goal is to highlight the stark difference between "reel life" and "real life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>, and to impart lessons on gratitude and avoiding waste, particularly concerning food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

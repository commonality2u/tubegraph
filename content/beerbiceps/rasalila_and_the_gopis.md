The [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] *avataram* is unique because it makes everyone obsessed with him, influencing their rational thought processes with a sense of magic from his arrival through all his *leelas* (divine plays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the *Rasalila* and the devotion of the Gopis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## The Gopis: Devotion Beyond Perception
The Gopis, often superficially translated as "Milkmen" or "Cowherds," represent individuals who are madly in love with [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. For them, everything revolves around [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.

The word "Gopi" itself holds a deeper meaning: "Go" refers not only to cows but also to human sense organs (*indriyas*), and "pi" refers to *piti*, meaning "to drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. Thus, Gopis are those who consume the essence of *Paramatma* (the Supreme Soul) with all their senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>. They are singularly focused on [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] in every action—seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. Becoming a Gopi means desiring [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] for himself, not for what he can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. This intense devotion leads to experiences like those of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who sought to experience [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] by becoming a Gopi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

### The Phenomenon of Rasalila
The *Rasalila* is a profound spiritual possibility for a seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. The [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavat Puranam]] dedicates five chapters within its 10th chapter (Dasham Kandam), which represents the "face of the Lord," to the *Rasalila* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. These five chapters are likened to the five *pranas* (life forces) within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. Understanding the divine, according to the *Puranam*, involves delving into the *Rasalila* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

The *Rasalila* begins on a full moon night (*Purnima*) when [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] plays his flute from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. The sound of the flute is heard only by the Gopis, who are then compelled to abandon their daily activities and rush towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. This represents the first stage of a seeker's journey: hearing the divine call and following it unreservedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Those who could not physically go experienced *moksha* (liberation) by entering a state where they no longer identified with their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.

Upon reaching [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]], each Gopi finds a personal [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] manifesting before her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. This is the second stage: experiencing profound bliss and allowing it to envelop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. However, a subtle thought of possessiveness (*ahankaram*) enters their minds ("such a Paramatma is in my control now") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. At this moment, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] disappears, clearing them of this ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. The Gopis then desperately search for him, mimicking his *leelas* and internalizing his form as a way to draw closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] reappears only when he chooses to, not when they lament, teaching that the divine cannot be controlled by the mind or speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.

The *Rasalila* is the dance of complete abandon where the Gopis have recognized his true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. This phenomenon, with [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] at the center and multiple Krishnas surrounding him, represents the *Shri Chakram* – a geometrical representation of the entire universe, where the central *Bindu* (point) is also present everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

### Misinterpretations of Rasalila
The *Rasalila* has been widely misinterpreted as a "dance of a lustful boy with young women," and this misinterpretation has been popularized in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. This derogatory view distorts the true essence of *Rasa*, which means "essence" or "joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. A *Rasika* is someone who can extract this essence and dissolve into the bliss of the experience, similar to how music or dance can lead to profound joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.

## Radha: The Key to Krishna's Heart
[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] is inaccessible without Radha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>. Radha is considered the one who grants the experience of becoming a Gopi (*gopibhava*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. She is the full manifestation of the divine feminine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>.

It is said that after Radha was crowned the queen of Vrindavan, she instructed everyone there to chant [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. However, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] was found chanting Radha's name and sent a message back, saying he liked her name, leading to the modification that everyone in Vrindavan should say "Radha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>. This is why people in Vrindavan constantly greet each other with "Radhe Radhe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>. Chanting Radha's name helps dispel other thoughts, filters out distractions, and cultivates a sense of love (*Prema*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. It allows one to recognize [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] in everyone, as Radha represents love that leads to [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>.

[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] can transform into [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Rama]] at will, but only Radha (as Sita) can accompany him in that form, emphasizing her unique and indispensable role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>.

## Vrindavan: Where Leelas Live On
Vrindavan is considered a phenomenal space where extraordinary things can occur, including an extraordinary calmness in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. It is believed to be an entry point into *Goloka*, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s eternal realm beyond *brahmaloka* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The *leelas* of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] are not just historical events but are believed to happen every day in Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Specific spots in Vrindavan are called *rasasthali*, where the *Rasalila* occurs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. To honor this, certain areas like Nidhivan are closed by 7 PM, as it is believed [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]], Radha, and the Gopis come at that time of night, and no one can see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Vrindavan corresponds to the *Sahasrara Chakra* in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. Visiting such *kshetras* (holy places) is not just about seeing idols but activating inner spiritual centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

A famous story from Vrindavan involves a Kadamba tree from which [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] jumped into the Yamuna river to subdue the five-headed serpent Kalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. The tree's bark has taken on the appearance of snake fangs, illustrating the power of constant thought to manifest reality ("the tree thinks about the time the snake came out and that's the last thing that the tree saw that tree has become that snake by virtue of thinking that") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

## Leaving Vrindavan and the Mahabharata
[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] eventually leaves Vrindavan to fulfill his purpose of slaying Kamsa in Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. This departure is a deeply sorrowful event for the Gopis, reflecting the pain of separation from the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. After killing Kamsa and re-establishing Ugrasena as king, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s *leelas* shift from *Madura leelas* (sweet, playful) to *Aishwarya leelas* (displaying his divine majesty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:26">[01:40:26]</a>. This marks the convergence of the [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] story from the [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavat Puranam]] with the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a>.

In the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]], [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] acts as a strategist and mentor to the Pandavas, using the conflict as a pretext to cleanse the earth of unrighteous kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. His actions, though seemingly complex, are always in alignment with *Dharma* (righteousness) and *Satya Sankalpa* (divine will) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

Every being who comes into contact with [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] achieves *moksha* (liberation from the cycle of *samsara*), marking their final birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>. This is the secret of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] *upasana* (worship) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:02">[01:47:02]</a>. As declared in the [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavad Gita]], [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] assures that he will take care of the constant welfare of those who believe him to be everything and dedicate their all to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

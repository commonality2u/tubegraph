From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The topic of [[occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]] and the existence of ghosts was discussed, with both the host and guest sharing their perspectives and personal encounters. The host believes in ghosts and suggests that not all spirits are malevolent, contrary to common [[cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits | cultural perceptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.

## Belief in Ghosts

The host states he believes in ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>. He feels that when a person dies, they inevitably leave "traces of their energy behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>. He notes that [[cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | culture]] often portrays ghosts as universally bad, but this is only "half a truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.

## Types of Spiritual Entities

Based on discussions with psychics and [[paranormal investigations and beliefs | paranormal investigators]], the host explains that the term "ghosts" is general, and there are different types of [[paranormal activities and supernatural entities | occult entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. The nature of a ghost depends on the person's personality and how they died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>. For example, if a person died with intense anger or felt they were killed prematurely, their ghost might retain that anger and aggression and constantly try to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. He mentions "poltergeists and pishach" as examples of different types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>.

The host references the movie *The Sixth Sense*, stating that the concept of spirits trying to communicate is considered a "real thing" by some psychics and [[paranormal investigations and beliefs | paranormal investigators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.

## Personal Experiences

The host recounted several [[personal ghost stories | personal ghost stories]]:

*   **Haunted Apartment:** When scouting for his current apartment, he felt a "strange ass energy," which was positive and friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. His business head, who stayed in the room first, reported waking up feeling like someone was looking at him, but not trying to harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>. The host experienced the same sensation for a week after moving in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. He believes this positive energy was a previous inhabitant of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>.
*   **Childhood Sleep Paralysis:** As a child, the host consistently felt "someone looking at me" at night in his old house, leading him not to sleep alone until he was 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. At age 11, he had an intense [[personal ghost stories | sleep paralysis]] experience while sleeping next to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>. He felt a figure "sitting on top of me and staring me down with like one eye and half her head was covered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. He remembered a mantra his mother taught him, and the experience faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>. Years later, watching a show about alien abduction on National Geographic, he saw an exact recreation of the figure he had seen, causing him to become very distressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:00">[34:19:00]</a>.
*   **Office Encounter:** Around four years prior, while meditating with a teammate in their office (a garage attached to his building), both felt a "strong and intense" presence in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:00">[35:26:00]</a>. They continued to meditate, believing it would push negative energies out of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. Afterward, he called a friend he believes is psychic, who, upon entering, immediately went to the room directly below his mother's old room and declared that the "entire part of the building used to be intensely haunted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. The psychic suggested the meditations had pushed the entity away, but traces remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>. Some junior teammates who stayed in that office have since reported seeing a "woman running around at night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>.

## Role of Empaths and Spirituality

The host identifies as an empath, believing empaths possess "healing energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. He suggests that when experiencing personal "angst," empaths might attract entities from "the other realm" that "need to be healed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. This concept links [[role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | spirituality]] and personal emotional states to paranormal interactions.

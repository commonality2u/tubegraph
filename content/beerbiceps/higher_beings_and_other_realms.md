The world is not limited to what is physically perceived; other beings and dimensions exist beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:54">[01:49:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. The belief that only human beings exist on Earth is a very limited way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Just as air exists though unseen, other beings exist even if we cannot perceive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

## Existence of Higher Beings

The speaker asserts knowledge of the existence of [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | higher beings]], rather than just believing in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. There are many kinds of such beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. These beings have a different rate of frequency of vibration in their bodies compared to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:01">[04:05:01]</a>. Consequently, humans may not feel them, and they may not feel humans, due to their differing frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:01">[04:05:01]</a>. Some of these beings can see humans if they wish, but not all are consciously aware of human presence, just as humans are often unaware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:01">[04:05:01]</a>.

The [[the_significance_of_higher_and_lower_beings_in_spirituality | significance of higher and lower beings in spirituality]] is contextual; to higher beings, undeveloped humans are akin to ants, unable to conceive of realities beyond their limited perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Categories of Invisible Beings

*   **Ghosts:** What people commonly refer to as "ghosts" are generally products of imagination or residual electrical charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. When a person dies suddenly (e.g., in an accident), the electric charges that have acquired a certain shape within the body are released and wander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. These charges may temporarily be visible due to special circumstances and retain the shape of the deceased body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. However, over time, this charge dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. These residual charges have no intelligence and cannot intentionally cause harm, though fear induced by their appearance might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Possession:** Ninety percent of cases believed to be possession are psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. These electrical charges cannot possess a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. In rare cases, other beings (not necessarily ghosts) are known to occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Demonic/Naughty Entities:** Not all invisible beings are demonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. There can be both good and bad invisible beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Some non-physical beings might encourage desires (e.g., sexual desires), which can be dangerous for someone on a spiritual path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. These beings are not inherently bad but can be a "bad influence" if one is moving in a different spiritual direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Such influences might infuse thoughts into a person's mind without their awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Angels/Farish:** These are considered "higher good beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. They are not God's soldiers, but beings belonging to a different dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. They will not become human beings, nor will human beings become angels; they are distinct species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Many such species exist on Earth, interpenetrating this world and extending beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Some beings can even come from other realms or universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **[[yeti_and_mystical_beings | Yeti]]:** These are believed to be living creatures inhabiting remote parts of mountains and forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>. One experience involved a furry, human-like creature that provided herbal medicine to prevent mountain fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The Yeti are considered "good people" who help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Nagas:** In ancient times, the Nagas (hooded serpents) were a species of beings that lived in another realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. They were considered teachers of humanity, symbolizing wisdom, which is why the Kundalini is also associated with Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The cobras seen today are considered "decadent leftovers" of this ancient species, as the others returned to their realm called "Nagaloka" after having relationships with human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Modern cobras are not as intelligent as their ancestors but are still more intelligent than other snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | Interaction with Spirits and Entities]]

Higher beings that are there to help can influence human minds during prayer or meditation, aiding in freedom from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. If negative influences from beings cause problems, invoking positive energies can negate the negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Spiritual practices like meditation often involve drawing a protective "mind circle" to keep away undesirable thoughts, which could be infused by other beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. In temples, figures at the gates (Dwarapalas) are symbolically there to keep away evil things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## Dimensions Beyond Perception

The concept of "Shiva" refers to a dimension beyond human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This abstract concept is beyond the ordinary three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The "third eye" in the depiction of Shiva symbolizes a special faculty needed to understand concepts beyond ordinary dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. With current sense organs, humans cannot perceive beyond the third dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Only when other sensory perceptions open up can one begin to grasp the idea of the next dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Shiva (Shivam) is the ultimate essence of all dimensions combined, meaning bliss, auspiciousness, and the Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

The speaker explains that the concept of going beyond dimensions means transcending linearity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Instead of trying to "reach" another dimension, one must sit quietly and still, meditating to allow perception to shift to a higher place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This stillness allows one to be "lifted" from an ordinary dimension to something else, as these dimensions are "Here, There, and Everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Time as a Dimension

Time is psychological and depends on change; without change, there is no time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. It is a relative and psychological concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. Going "beyond time" means understanding it, at which point time as commonly known disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This understanding reveals that human life is not merely birth and death, but a continuous journey without a known origin or end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This cycle continues until one consciously decides to stop it, realizing its endless and "useless" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

Kareena Kapoor Khan reflects on her extensive career, defining Bollywood stardom not merely by box office success but through a combination of hard work, self-conditioning, and an unwavering passion for her craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. She emphasizes the demanding nature of the profession and the evolution of industry expectations over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## The Essence of Stardom: Confidence and Love for the Craft

For Kareena, her greatest asset throughout her career has been her confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, which she sees as an inherent quality that cannot be faked or "put on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This [[the_impact_of_confidence_on_kareena_kapoor_khans_career | confidence]] is evident in her performances, notably as the character Geet from *Jab We Met*, who inspired many with her lovable yet assertive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

She expresses immense gratitude for having enjoyed every minute on set since the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Her love for her job is paramount, as she believes it's "very tough" to sustain a career if one doesn't truly love what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Acting, for her, is like an "intoxication" or a "trance" she feels every time she's in front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Her [[kareena_kapoor_khans_approach_to_acting_and_character_development | approach to acting]] involves going "extremely deep" within herself to pull out performances, especially for complex, "grey" characters like Rupa in *Laal Singh Chaddha* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, which she finds most interesting to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Evolving Ambition and the Price of Fame

In her 20s, Kareena was driven by an intense hunger to be the "best" and to achieve box office success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. After 25 years in the industry, her ambition has shifted towards finding peace in her roles and seeking a "deeper understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. She no longer chases success as everything, but rather aims to prove herself as a good actor and star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This shift is influenced by her [[kareena_kapoor_khan_and_motherhood | personal growth as a human being]], being a wife and mother, which has brought different responsibilities into her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Public Life
Kareena acknowledges that her profession is incredibly demanding, requiring constant professionalism regardless of personal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. She highlights the expectation to always be a "perfect star" when in public, even when facing personal struggles or having a bad day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The profession demands a "selfish" focus on the craft, where personal tragedies must be set aside for the sake of a shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

She expresses frustration with the constant pressure for a "picture perfect" image and the pervasive paparazzi culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, stating that everything is "OTT (over the top)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. She prefers to keep her circle small because the constant scrutiny and feeling of being "viewed with the glance of 'oh, I'm talking to Kareena Kapoor'" can be tiring and draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This illustrates her perspective on [[navigating_fame_and_public_perceptions_in_Bollywood | navigating fame and public perceptions]].

### Experience with Failure
Kareena candidly shares that she has faced "too many ups and downs" and a "string of failures" in her 25-year career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. She admits to being "very upset" and crying herself to sleep over films that didn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. However, she believes that failures are as important as successes, stating that without failure, she wouldn't truly appreciate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Family Influence and Personal Approach

Kareena's [[family_influences_on_kareena_kapoor_khans_career_decisions | family background]], while prominent in Bollywood, instilled a grounded perspective. Her parents never made her feel like they "come from this family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, and her mother, being "self-made," emphasized a basic and simple upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Her mother doesn't understand the modern paparazzi culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, focusing instead on good acting and good films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

Kareena attributes much of her personality and confidence to her mother, who was a "very strong woman" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. She also observed her sister, Karisma Kapoor's, career from a young age, which provided invaluable guidance and insight into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Kareena affirms her love for her journey, including the mistakes, as she has learned from every single thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. She aims to continue working as long as she feels that "hunger" to do more, stating that the day it disappears, she will be "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Her motivation is internal, driven by personal satisfaction and the desire to be happy and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

> "I love the journey, I love the mistakes, I love the journey, I love every single thing because I learned everything here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>

## Modern Stardom and Future Outlook

Kareena believes that modern audiences are accepting of diverse content, valuing a good story in any form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. She notes the shift from rom-coms to action films but anticipates a return to comedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

She continues to maintain a "noor" (glow) and "hunger" for more, driven by a constant desire to improve and stretch her abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. For Kareena, stardom is not about perfection, but rather a continuous process of striving and evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. She describes herself as "completely imperfect," constantly trying to figure things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Ultimately, she aims for happiness and contentment in her life, prioritizing her family while continuing to find satisfaction in her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

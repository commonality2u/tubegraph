The geopolitical landscape is marked by significant conflicts, including the ongoing situation in Israel and Palestine, and Iran's multifaceted role in regional dynamics. These conflicts are shaped by historical grievances, power struggles, and the interplay of state and non-state actors.

## Conflict in Israel and Palestine

The current conflict in Israel and Gaza escalated dramatically following an attack on a Saturday, which initially seemed unbelievable due to the scale and nature of the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Israel, a country previously seen in a "much happier side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>, experienced a massive and unprovoked attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

### Eyewitness Account from Israel
A journalist recounts their experience flying into Tel Aviv just hours after the attack began, observing that only journalists and soldiers enter a country during such times, while everyone else is leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Upon landing at Ben Gurion Airport, the first siren warning of incoming fire was heard, forcing everyone into shelters, which served as a "very very hard entry into a war zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

During their time, they observed:
*   **Raw Human Emotion** People were unwilling to speak about their experiences, such as a family whose sister was taken hostage, due to the raw trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Volatile Environments** Reporting from areas like Jerusalem with a significant Arab population could be tense, with drivers urging quick departure from volatile zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **Constant Threat** The presence of missile alert systems and the need to run to shelters, even sitting under a pomegranate tree with locals offering refuge, highlighted the constant danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty** Even a false alert about Hezbollah entering the conflict prompted advice from Israeli contacts to "take the first flight out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>, indicating the fear of a prolonged war.
*   **Resilience of the People** The strength and grit of the Israeli people were evident, as they continued to follow customs and take life one day at a time even when their world seemed to have collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. Israel, a country that "no one gave a chance" 30 years ago, has transformed from an orange exporter to the "startup capital of the world," demonstrating significant enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>.

### The Broader Picture of the Conflict
The conflict is not a "black and white equation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>; while initially Israel was clearly the victim of an unprovoked and heinous attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>, the subsequent actions have led to widespread suffering. Over 30,000 civilian deaths in Gaza are a "very big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>, leading to anger and pushback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.

Israeli friends now express a general sentiment that they "want Netanyahu to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, as he is not a popular leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. They also want their people, including many hostages, brought back from Gaza, recognizing that every bomb dropped puts them at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The strategy of "eradication of Hamas" is seen as a "very broad and honestly unattainable goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, as killing leaders may radicalize more individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. It is crucial that "all people in Palestine or the Palestinian territory should not be punished for the horror that Hamas perpetrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

The world lacks a clear strategy, with the US providing aid to Gaza while simultaneously supplying weapons to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>, a seemingly contradictory approach driven by [[future_of_us_geopolitics_and_societal_issues | political calculations]] for the upcoming election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. The argument is that conflicts continue because they serve "someone's purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>, with the Israeli Prime Minister remaining in power as long as the war persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>.

A solution must be found through conversation, as seen after the Yom Kippur War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. However, in hindsight, a more astute leader might have capitalized on the initial anger against Hamas and worked with Arab powers, instead of resorting to "brute force" to overcompensate for an intelligence failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. The displacement of 1.4 million Palestinians to Rafah without a clear destination highlights the lack of a viable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

## Iran's Geopolitical Role

Iran has always been a relevant geopolitical player, particularly due to its oil wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. Historically, under the Shah, Iran was completely pro-West and liberal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. However, after the 1979 Revolution, the clergy came to power, dismantling the previous system and implementing a more "regressive society" under Islamic law, limiting freedoms, especially for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

Iran is a Shia-majority country, contrasting with Sunni-majority Arab powers, contributing to a sectarian divide in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Its current geopolitical significance stems from several factors:
*   **Nuclear Deal (JCPOA)** Iran entered the JCPOA, agreeing not to enrich uranium for a bomb and allowing international inspectors, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions to aid its struggling economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. The US unilaterally walked out of this deal under Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.
*   **Regional Proxies** Iran has spread itself thin across the region by supporting proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as maintaining a force in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. These actions have caused issues with many regional actors.
*   **Internal Protests** Recent years have seen significant internal unrest, such as the anti-hijab protests triggered by the killing of a 21-year-old girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>, leading to hundreds of arrests and deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.
*   **Rivalry with Saudi Arabia** Iran and Saudi Arabia have a long-standing enmity, with Saudi Arabia viewing itself as the leader of the Muslim world and home to Islam's biggest pilgrimage sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>.
*   **Performative Strikes** The recent missile strike between Israel and Iran was seen as a "performative strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>. It was intended to show Iran's people that they had struck Israel without causing significant damage or provoking a strong reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>.

These interconnected conflicts demonstrate the complex and often unpredictable nature of [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical strategies]] and their human impact.

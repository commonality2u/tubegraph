Dr. S. Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs, addresses the youth of India, including emerging figures like Virat Kohli and Jemimah Rodrigues, emphasizing their role in shaping the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He describes the current period as one of "young, new and motivated India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and believes young Indians should look to experienced figures like himself for guidance during intense times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Current Landscape for Young India

Dr. Jaishankar observes a growing interest in foreign policy among the populace, partly due to increased global connectivity through technology like smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This connectivity fosters global content consumption and comparisons, making everything from daily habits to thoughts more globally oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He notes that both he and Virat Kohli are seen as "faces of young India," representing a more assertive stance on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

His approach to diplomacy, though traditionally measured, has evolved into a more responsive posture when India is "pushed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This assertiveness is not personal but reflects a collective defense of India's dignity and respect on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## The Role of [[entrepreneurship_and_business_ventures|Entrepreneurship and Business Ventures]]

The Minister highlights the crucial role of [[entrepreneurship_and_business_ventures|entrepreneurs]] in India's geopolitical standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. He asserts that the key is to "Chase Excellence, create employment" to achieve "National Excellence" in the "global sport of geopolitics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Key aspects for Indian [[entrepreneurship_and_business_ventures|entrepreneurs]]:
*   **Competitiveness**: India must be fundamentally competitive, not just against specific nations like China, but globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Building Strengths**: Initiatives like "Make in India," "Startup India," and "Gati Shakti" are about building indigenous capabilities, including factories, businesses, agriculture, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Job Creation**: The ultimate goal is to create jobs and opportunities for the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Global Branding**: Foreign policy plays a role in marketing and branding India as a responsible and safe magnet for international business and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## The "Global Workplace" and Mobility

Prime Minister Modi consistently advocates for viewing the world as a "global workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This perspective means that work opportunities for talented Indians can be anywhere globally, and foreign policy's role is to "open up those doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

The concept of a "brain drain" is reframed by Dr. Jaishankar, suggesting that the world is now a "membrane" where people can freely move in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. He believes that the days of a permanent commitment to an overseas job are changing, and many will realize that opportunities in India can be superior to those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

Silicon Valley itself is showing increased interest in "The Valleys of India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. The establishment of manufacturing facilities by global companies like Apple in India serves as validation of an improved business atmosphere and the quality of Indian talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. Similarly, large Indian companies are increasingly investing within India rather than seeking hedges abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Advice for Young Leaders

Dr. Jaishankar's message to young Indians, particularly those embodying the spirit of Virat Kohli or Jemimah Rodrigues, is to have "self-belief" in this new era of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. He emphasizes the interconnectedness of national and personal choices:
> "A good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>

He notes that the world is waiting for today's 20-year-olds to make things happen, and it is the obligation of the older generation to create a favorable environment for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

Leadership, he states, "can come from a young person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. He cites Prime Minister Modi's status as a "Youth Icon" as an example of leadership that resonates across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

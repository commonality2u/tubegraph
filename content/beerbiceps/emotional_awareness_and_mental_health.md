[[Emotional awareness and mental health]] are central themes in discussions regarding personal growth, professional success, and the navigation of complex relationships. Understanding one's own emotional landscape and that of others can significantly enhance well-being and interaction.

## The Foundation in Psychology

Kiara Advani, an actor, studied psychology and humanities in the 11th and 12th grades, subjects that deeply interested her and where she excelled academically, even topping her school in psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. She briefly considered pursuing further studies abroad in psychology as a Plan B, due to her passion for acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Her background in psychology contributes to her strong people skills, which she attributes partly to her Punjabi heritage and a family environment where everyone is very expressive and a "people's person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

The host, Ranveer, noted that podcasting has taught him bits of psychology by allowing him to "enter so many people's heads and hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. He emphasizes the practical relevance of psychology, stating that reading textbooks helps understand people and situations, acting as a "relevant life skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Both agree that subjects like life skills, people skills, and psychology should be studied more in school to better equip individuals for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

## Self-Perception and Mental Well-being

Studying psychological disorders can lead to self-diagnosis, as individuals often feel they possess "every disorder in the book" when reading about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This happens because humans inherently share aspects of these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Kiara Advani describes herself as a "very transparent" person who cannot hide her emotions; her feelings are visible on her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. She maintains a consistent persona, being the same person whether with loved ones, her team, or alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, highlighting a strong sense of self-awareness and authenticity.

Ranveer observes that Kiara is "very connected to [her] emotional side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. He also notes her ability to have a positive relationship with her personal experiences, whether positive or traumatic, as they serve as "fuel to better yourself as an actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Kiara states that her "emotional quotient is very high," leading her to empathize deeply with others' feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

### [[Mental health and coping mechanisms | Coping Mechanisms]] and [[mental_health_and_lifestyle | Lifestyle]]

Kiara mentions experiencing anxiety before film releases, leading to sleepless nights, but acknowledges it as a mix of excitement, anxiety, and nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Ranveer offers a reframing technique, suggesting that the physical symptoms of anxiety are the same as excitement. By channeling one's mind to perceive these symptoms as excitement, one's "real life can also be seen as excitement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

Ranveer describes having an "addictive personality disorder" which leads him to get deeply involved in anything that provides a dopamine rush, such as [[Spirituality meditation and mental health in modern life | religious practices]] or gymming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. He considers his podcasting job his "meditation ground" and "high," as it allows him to exchange energy with people and serves as a form of "refueling" for his entrepreneurial pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. He also mentions having done Reiki, which he states changed his life by teaching him the value of wishing well and fostering a lack of judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

## Emotional Intelligence in Relationships

Both Kiara and Ranveer discuss the importance of emotional intelligence in relationships.
Kiara states that in a relationship, two people should make each other feel important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. She emphasizes mutual respect, understanding, and communication as crucial elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. She believes in accepting a person for who they are, rather than trying to change their inherent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. She prioritizes her relationships, sometimes even over her work life, influenced by her parents' loving example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

She also highlights the need for equality in modern relationships, where traditional gender roles of "bread earner" are blurring, and both partners can equally contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Impact of Emotions on Acting and Professional Life

[[Emotional and psychological challenges of acting | The acting profession]] often requires deep emotional engagement, which can be challenging to detach from. Kiara found it difficult to "snap out" of the internalized character of Preeti from *Kabir Singh*, requiring her to learn "the art of detach" when transitioning to opposite roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. She believes that connecting deeply with emotions on screen makes performances authentic, allowing the audience to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Ranveer acknowledges that emotional expression can be suppressed in business environments, which can negatively impact personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, he also recognizes that being an emotional person can lead to feeling pain much deeper, though there's a healing process that eventually allows one to snap out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Understanding and Managing Disappointment

Kiara suggests that understanding the intention behind a person's behavior can reduce disappointment. For example, anger might stem from an inability to express something, and focusing on this underlying intention rather than just the anger can change one's perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Curiosity Over Judgment

Ranveer recounts advice from a monk who redefined judgment not as looking down on someone, but as using someone as an example for one's own life, even by thinking "I'll never be like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. To remove judgment, the monk advised replacing it with curiosity, which means trying to understand where people are "coming from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Judgment, he notes, leads to "locking the door" in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Kiara confirms she is not a judgmental person, preferring to make observations rather than form immediate opinions or judgments, especially after a single meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. She highlights that an environment of curiosity, rather than judgment, encourages openness and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## The Value of Emotional Awareness

Ranveer observes that women, like Kiara, are "inherently emotionally aware," while men often need to develop this trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He notes that women's empathy and emotional awareness contribute to valuable opinions, especially in areas like career advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

Kiara also speaks about the societal pressures on men (e.g., value tied to money/fame) and women (e.g., domestic roles), acknowledging that these deeply ingrained expectations can lead to different "traumas" or pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. She advocates for mutual understanding of these pressures within relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Both agree that communication and managing ego are crucial to prevent the downfall of relationships, whether romantic, platonic, or professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Ranveer concludes that Kiara is "very articulate with your emotions and very aware of the needs and the feeling," which is a rare trait he has observed in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Sva Shashi, a young entrepreneur from India, attributes his success to his practice of celibacy, specifically following a "no sex and no fap" rule for nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He believes this practice has granted him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores his journey, the principles he follows, and the perceived effects of celibacy on his personal and professional life.

## Sva Shashi's Journey into Celibacy and Yoga

Sva Shashi divides his life into two parts: before and after the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Before 17, he describes his life with "Three A's": arrogance, attitude, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. His initial aim as a six-year-old was to play cricket for India and win the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. His parents enrolled him in yoga classes to help him balance and focus better for his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, and he observed significant improvements in his cricket performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

At 17, Sva Shashi took over a yoga class his father had paid for but couldn't complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. There, he met a teacher he initially mistook for "another godman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. He was curious about enlightenment and intuition, hoping to "see the future" to accelerate his cricket career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, his teacher immediately corrected his misconception, stating that if Sva Shashi thought he could enlighten him, he was a fool, and the teacher would be a bigger fool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This honesty resonated with Sva Shashi, prompting him to continue the classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

After 30-45 days of classes, Sva Shashi began practicing various *sadhana* (Sanskrit for discipline), including 10, 11, 20, and 40-day periods of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These disciplines involved going silent for 40 days, meditating for 9 hours daily, and practicing Vipassana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. He noticed that every time he completed a *sadhana*, he advanced "one step ahead in my life in different aspects," including professionally and in his cricket game, even becoming captain of his college team when he expected to be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:07:02]</a>.

### The Five Precepts

His teacher eventually gave him five precepts to follow, emphasizing that a commitment in yoga is absolute, with "no going against your words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These precepts were:

1.  **No Intoxication**: No alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He claims to not remember the last time he even killed a mosquito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing**: Both physical and mental stealing (e.g., coveting someone else's possessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Aspiring to buy things is acceptable, but not mentally stealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Not even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy**: No sex, no masturbation, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:20]</a>. This was the most challenging due to his age and "accessibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Initially, Sva Shashi committed to celibacy for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, but his teacher revealed it was a seven-year commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Despite the difficulty, especially during his "prime time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, he honored his promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. For the first 1.5 years, he tried to prove his teacher wrong, but by 19.5 years old, it became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. At 27, he had not broken any of the five precepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Benefits of Semen Retention and the Yogic Lifestyle

Sva Shashi highlights that the [[spirituality_and_personal_wellbeing | benefits]] he experienced are a result of all five *sadhana* together, not just semen retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Performance and Creativity
The core benefit of semen retention, according to Sva Shashi, is the upward channeling of energy to the brain, which "opens up a completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This energy flow leads to:
*   Increased stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   Higher energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   Improved performance, whether in cricket or professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   Enhanced confidence in social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Sva Shashi encourages others to try semen retention for just 21 days to experience its effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, contrasting it with the tiredness felt after ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. He believes that ancient yogic knowledge contains scientific truths that modern science is still "researching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Managing Sexual Energy and Cravings
Initially, managing sexual urges was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Sva Shashi was taught specific physical and mindful exercises (*asanas* and breathings) to channel sexual energy in the right direction, converting it into creative thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

An example of a yoga technique to manage lust and horniness is:
*   Sit in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Take a deep breath in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   Visualize the energy (the rush of blood to sex organs) flowing upward to your spine and into your brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   Breathe out and imagine that energy spreading through your brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

This basic yoga technique helps in the initial stages of no-fap practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Advanced meditation schools like Osho, Isha Foundation, YSS, or Chinmaya Mission School teach similar yogas for controlling and re-channeling sexual energy into [[relationships_and_personal_growth | creative energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### Personal Transformation and Attractiveness
Sva Shashi states that celibacy and the five precepts lead to a significant [[relationships_and_personal_growth | personal growth]]. He notes that it's "unreal" how temptations (like parties or attractive individuals) arise once one commits to a path, testing one's mental strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

He has been told that semen retention makes one "more attractive" or "more magnetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, attributing this to energy rather than physical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. He observes that women are often drawn to him because they trust him and feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, perceiving people "in the right sense" without being swayed by immediate emotions or physical desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

The definition of attraction also shifts for him, moving "beyond the physical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. He questions why physical appearance dictates attraction, advocating for compassion, love, and empathy for others instead of immediate sexual intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. He emphasizes that physical attraction is superficial and fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, contrasting it with the short-lived pleasure of ejaculation, which often leaves one tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

While he still experiences lust, he is conscious of it and knows how to transform it into compassion and love for himself and the other person, causing the feeling to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. He views sex as "beautiful" because it creates new life, emphasizing the importance of the couple's thoughts and energy during conception, as this influences the child's *karma* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### Intuition and Manifestation
Sva Shashi's spiritual and clean lifestyle has significantly increased his intuition, which he equates to a "Sixth Sense" or "third eye" (Ajna chakra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. This involves "knowing things before they happen," understanding vibes, and knowing what to do at life's crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

He, however, emphasizes that he has never consciously used his intuition for his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. His teacher taught him that [[spirituality_and_personal_wellbeing | spirituality]] (Adhyatm) means "coming to oneself" or "being in the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Actively trying to be intuitive breaks this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. Instead, intuition happens automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>, and everyone possesses it, though some simply realize it more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. He doesn't believe in coincidences, asserting that events happen because of past thoughts or intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

Sva Shashi shares instances of seemingly "manifesting" events through his truthful speech:
*   A friend's burned dress after Sva Shashi recommended a different color, which his teacher explained as nature transpiring due to his commitment to not lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   Predicting the exact date a friend would receive her UK visa and depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   Manifesting his desire to work with Christopher Nolan (as an actor) and having Jennifer Lopez invest in his company, despite initial ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. He flew with Jennifer Lopez in a private jet to watch her concert, and she is now an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:15]</a>.

Intuition can be blocked by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. Opening the Ajna chakra through practices like pranayama, meditation, and yoga enhances it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

## Professional Success and Life Lessons

Sva Shashi is the sole founder of Diva Yoga, an all-women wellness startup focused on yoga, which is part of the larger, unisex brand SVA, aiming to connect "7 billion breaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Investors in his wellness ecosystem include Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malaika Arora, Shahid Kapoor, Mira Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush (Rajinikanth's daughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:02:10]</a>. Investors look at the founder, business purpose and scalability, and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

He asserts that his business success is built on trust, love, respect, ethics, values, and honest hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, challenging the notion that one must lie to run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Three Key Life Learnings:
Sva Shashi offers three life learnings, which also serve as his [[balancing_professional_life_and_personal_milestones | career]] and [[balancing_family_responsibilities_and_career | life balance]] philosophy:

1.  **Be True and Authentic to Yourself**: He emphasizes the difficulty but necessity of staying authentic without being swayed or "bombarded by environment, peer group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Taking the first step is crucial for any achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Self-Care (Physical and Mental)**: This is vital for taking care of and loving oneself, which then enables one to care for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. He advises a mix of physical activities (gym, functional training) and mindful practices like breathing exercises to believe in oneself, be present, and become a better version of oneself daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. He suggests that 4-6 hours of quality sleep are sufficient with one hour of daily yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. The motivation to start his yoga company stemmed from the profound personal changes he experienced through self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person**: He believes the most critical skill for a CEO is people management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. Employees leave employers, not companies, so being a good employer and fostering love is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Being a "people person" contributes to becoming a more compassionate individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.

He concludes with the philosophy: "Love like there is no tomorrow, and if Tomorrow Comes, Love Again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

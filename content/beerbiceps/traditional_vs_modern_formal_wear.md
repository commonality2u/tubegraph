[[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | Formal dressing]] or [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | office dressing]] is governed by strict yet simple rules, and a person's [[importance_of_dressing_well_for_confidence_in_indian_men | fashion sense]] often dictates perception, especially when [[importance_of_dressing_well_for_confidence_in_indian_men | dressing for formal events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Dressing too casually can lead to not being taken seriously, while dressing too formally or like everyone else might prevent an individual from standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Modern Formal (Business Casual)**: Allows for more flexibility and options, enabling some playfulness with the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

It's important to only follow modern formal rules if the specific [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | office]] or [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | formal environment]] permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

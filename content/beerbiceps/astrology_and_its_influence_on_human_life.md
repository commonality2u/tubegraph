Astrology is often understood as a science detailing the influence of planets on an individual's *sanskar*, or nature and emotional patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. It is based on the idea that various celestial bodies, including planets like [[role_of_grahas_in_astrology | Rahu Ketu]] and the sun (as in Western sun signs), impact human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## The Astrological Chart: An Opening Balance Sheet

An astrological chart is typically prepared a day or two after a baby is born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. This chart projects future events in life, such as happenings at certain ages, marriage, and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. While the child itself has not yet performed any *karma* in this current life, the chart is based on the [[karma_and_predestined_life_paths | destiny of the soul]], not the physical body's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

The astrological chart represents the "opening balance sheet" for the soul's current lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This balance sheet is identical to the "closing balance sheet" of the soul's previous lifetime, comprising all its accumulated *karma* and *sanskar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. It's the sum of all past transactions and experiences carried by the soul into the new birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

Astrology also speaks of [[astrological_houses_and_their_significance | 12 houses of astrology]], each associated with different aspects of life, such as personality, married life, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Predictions: Probability vs. Reality

Astrological predictions are best understood as "probability manuals" rather than "reality manuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. They are based on the soul's past *sanskar* and *karma* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. However, an individual has the power to create their own reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

If an individual's *sanskar* changes in this lifetime, the influence of the planets on them will also change, causing some predictions not to come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Conversely, if one's *sanskar* remains unchanged, predictions are more likely to manifest as written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### Changing Your Destiny

One's [[the_role_of_karma_free_will_and_destiny_in_spiritual_life | destiny is pre-decided by one's own past karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. However, while consequences of past *karma* will always arise, changing one's present *karma* can alter how those outcomes are experienced, preventing suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

For example, [[impact_of_spiritual_practices_on_astrological_charts | meditation]] and spiritual practices can melt or change one's *sanskar* for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By energizing oneself and consciously choosing to create positive *karma*, one can modify the spiritual balance sheet of their current financial year (lifetime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This means that even if a negative outcome, such as divorce, is predicted in a [[perspectives_on_love_relationships_and_personal_life | destiny chart]], it can be avoided by changing one's present *karma* and putting genuine effort into the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

Therefore, individuals are the creators of their own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. Consuming astrological predictions without understanding their probabilistic nature can lead individuals to fulfill those probabilities as their reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. It is suggested to focus on creating the best possible *karma* rather than dwelling on probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

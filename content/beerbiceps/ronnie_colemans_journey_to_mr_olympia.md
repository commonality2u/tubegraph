Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, embarked on a bodybuilding journey that defied conventional paths and expectations, driven by an unparalleled dedication and a unique mindset. His path to becoming one of the most dominant figures in bodybuilding history was characterized by intense training, stringent dietary demands, and a profound mental fortitude.

## Early Life and Entry into Bodybuilding
Originally from Louisiana, Ronnie Coleman moved to Texas after graduating college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. His entry into bodybuilding was not initially driven by a desire to win titles, but rather to secure a free gym membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Coleman turned professional relatively quickly, achieving pro status in just one year, a stark contrast to most who take around five years to build popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. A notable aspect of his early career was turning pro in Poland, not the United States, which meant he had less "Fanfare" and was initially overlooked by the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

## Winning the First Mr. Olympia
Winning his first Mr. Olympia title was described by Coleman as "the most amazing thing that will ever happen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The overwhelming excitement led him to black out for an estimated 10 to 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Upon regaining consciousness, his initial thought was "this is not happening to me," reflecting his humble beginnings where he never aimed to win the Olympia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Training Philosophy and Edge
Coleman's success was rooted in his unique and rigorous training approach, characterized by immense commitment and intensity. He firmly believes his "tactical edge" was his high-volume, heavy lifting, performing feats like squatting and deadlifting 800 pounds, leg pressing 2300 pounds for nine reps, and bench pressing 500 pounds for reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. He credits this heavy lifting for his exceptional size, definition, and muscle thickness/density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>, stating that "nobody lifted like I did to get that thick muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

### Mental Fortitude and Visualization
A crucial component of Coleman's training was his mental approach and strong faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. He often went to the gym with an "attitude," ready for "war" to defend his title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Visualization played a significant role; he would "do it before it's already done," picturing his lifts, like the 800-pound squat, for weeks in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. His background in powerlifting, which he started at 14-15 years old, provided a strong foundation for his heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

### Functional Strength and Flexibility
Coleman also emphasized functional fitness. Despite his massive size, he maintained impressive flexibility, able to do splits on stage even at 330 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>. He attributed this to consistently stretching for 20-30 minutes every night, a habit he carried over from his football days where stretching was a daily routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25:00">[53:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>.

## Diet and Nutrition for Mr. Olympia
For Coleman, diet was the "biggest challenge" in bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a>. To achieve his immense size, he had to consume six meals a day, each containing a pound of chicken, often having to wake up in the middle of the night to eat, regardless of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. He worked with a nutritionist who guided him to increase his food intake from 10 ounces to 16 ounces per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>. At his peak, he consumed 600 grams of protein daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>. Red meat, though eaten only once a day, played a significant role in achieving his distinct muscle thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. He believes it's difficult to achieve the same level of thickness with just chicken and fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>.

## [[Ronnie Colemans perspective on steroid use | Steroid Use]]
Ronnie Coleman openly discussed his use of steroids, emphasizing that all substances he took were "doctor prescribed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:22:00">[42:22:00]</a>. He underwent health check-ups every four months to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were functioning correctly, reporting that he "never had a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>. He started taking steroids at 30 years old (around 1995-1996), initially afraid to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>. He sought information from fellow bodybuilder Flex Wheeler, who was "quite honest" about his regimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>. Coleman insisted he only took "normal dosage" amounts, believing massive amounts would have compromised his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>. He highlighted the importance of doctor guidance and regular check-ups (at least every six months) for anyone considering steroid use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>. He noted that unlike some bodybuilders, his skin remained healthy and free of pimples and red marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>.

## Life as Mr. Olympia
Coleman's life during his reign as Mr. Olympia was all-consuming. After winning each title, he would have only "a day or two to enjoy it" before immediately preparing for the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This dedication meant living a "lonely phase" with "real real dark times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. He couldn't go out to eat, to movies, parties, or weddings; everything revolved around bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. He described it as a "24/7, 365-day job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

### Daily Life Impact
His massive physique presented practical challenges: he had to get rid of some cars he bought because he gained too much weight for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. All his clothes, including his police uniforms, had to be custom-tailored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.

## Post-Olympia Life and Philosophy
After his competitive career, Coleman began to fully appreciate his achievements, finally able to "sit back, relax and soak it all in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. When his eight-year winning streak ended, it took him "a couple hours" to come to terms with it, acknowledging that "everything comes to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### Resilience and Humility
Despite facing injuries and over a dozen surgeries on his back, hips, and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, Coleman maintained a strong, positive mindset. He claimed injuries never psychologically affected him, and that training through his herniated disc even helped rehabilitate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

His background as a police officer instilled in him a "strong minded" ability to rationalize difficult situations, viewing tragic events as part of life's "cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. This perspective contributed to his profound humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a>. He expressed that he's "one of the luckiest guys in the whole wide world" because God gave him a unique gift, giving him reason to be "extremely happy for the rest of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.

### Family Support and Outlook on Life
Throughout his career, Coleman's family was a constant source of support. His entire family, including his mother, brother, and sister, attended his first contest and many international competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. His mother cooked all his six meals a day, and his siblings helped with fan mail, car maintenance, and household chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. He never felt lonely because his family was always close-knit and supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

Coleman attributes his enduring happiness to choosing joy and believing "everything's going to be all right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:08">[1:25:08]</a>. He considers aging a "good thing" because it means "it's time to relax, take it easy" and enjoy life's benefits, like spending time with family, going to movies, and traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.

## Advice for Young Bodybuilders
Coleman's primary advice for aspiring bodybuilders is to seek "knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. He learned through trial and error, eventually finding the right nutritionist and coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. He advises finding knowledgeable mentors and learning as much as possible from them, and then moving on to others with even greater expertise, advocating for multiple coaches to reach the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:01:00]</a>. Knowledge, he asserts, encompasses all aspects of becoming a champion: diet, training, and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.

The Indian film industry has experienced rapid and significant changes since the pandemic, moving away from its pre-pandemic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These shifts affect every aspect of filmmaking, from production and financing to audience reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape for Artists
In the evolving post-pandemic landscape, established and upcoming artists, such as Janhvi Kapoor, often face challenges in expressing themselves fully in public forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Traditional interview formats are often repetitive and ask generic questions, frequently aiming for clickbait, which can make artists defensive and unwilling to open up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## The Rise of Podcasts
This shift has highlighted the "magic of podcasts," providing a platform for artists to have more genuine and in-depth conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For instance, Janhvi Kapoor notably opened up like never before on a podcast episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This new format caters to the desire for authenticity, which people increasingly seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The host suggests that podcasts serve as a form of therapy or self-discovery, allowing guests and hosts to delve deeply into minds and perspectives, offering a unique "kick" and the feeling of living through someone else's lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[impact_of_the_podcast_on_indian_content_creation | impact of the podcast on Indian content creation]].

## Personal Realignments
The pandemic has also "sped up the process of realigning priorities" for individuals, including those in the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This personal shift may contribute to artists' increasing desire for authenticity over curated public images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This change in individual priorities can also be seen as part of the broader [[experience_and_impact_of_covid19 | experience and impact of COVID19]].

## Audience Engagement and Content Trends
In the post-pandemic era, with the rise of short-form content and social media-induced attention span changes, audiences, particularly Gen Z (born after 2000), require "really gripping" content to remain engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This has led to a growing demand for horror and dark content, which offers a form of escapism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Shows like "Euphoria" succeed because they offer constant action and fast-paced camera movements that cater to this new attention dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

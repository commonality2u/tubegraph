Ajay Nagar, widely known by his YouTube persona CarryMina, emphasizes a clear distinction between his public and private identities. While he openly shares content as CarryMina, his personal life as Ajay Nagar remains intentionally private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Maintaining Privacy
Nagar considers himself a "very private person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He believes certain aspects of his life should remain personal and unshared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This decision stems from a desire to maintain boundaries, as he feels that if he shares one private detail, he would be expected to share others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He describes himself as an introvert who mostly stays indoors, finding his room to be his world where he works, plays games, and relaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This personal space was integral to building his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Challenges of Public Exposure
[[Dealing with social media fame and public perception | Fame]], particularly for a teenager, can significantly impact one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Nagar highlights the difficulty of being a famous teenager in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He notes that while teenagers typically enjoy parties, his "madness" as a teenager is curtailed by public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. There's a constant awareness of needing to provide "correct" answers during events, often under the watchful eye of a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

A significant challenge is the intrusion into private family moments. Nagar shares an anecdote where people approach him and speak in the same language he uses in his videos, even when he's with his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This makes him uncomfortable, as he feels it's inappropriate to use such language in front of his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He makes an effort to moderate his language during live streams, knowing his mother might be watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Missing Out on Experiences
The demands of his career have led Nagar to miss out on fundamental life experiences. For instance, he never learned to drive due to a lack of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He also missed out on a typical college life experience, breaking the "normal cycle" of education and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. He feels a sense of missing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> and expresses a desire to experience hostel or shared flat living, and college life, both for personal experience and to create relatable content for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Parental Perspective
Nagar's parents are also navigating the new reality of his fame. He notes that they are "experiencing that thing" as it's new for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Colleagues often ask them to introduce their children to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. They are "learning together how to deal with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, with his mother specifically advising him not to use abusive language towards mothers or sisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Managing Pressure
Despite a huge following, Nagar states he doesn't feel pressure from his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He attributes this to his inability to fully comprehend the scale of his viewership, as he's never seen such a large number of people together in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. He believes that taking pressure negatively impacts his work, so he consciously avoids it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Advice for Growth
Nagar's advice for anyone aspiring to grow, regardless of their field, is to **experience things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He urges people to step out of their comfort zones and embrace new experiences, even if they turn out poorly, as these moments often become cherished memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. He believes that new experiences can lead to life-changing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

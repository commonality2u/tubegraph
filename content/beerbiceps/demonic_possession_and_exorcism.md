Demonic possession is described as a state where an individual shows vulnerability, allowing a demonic entity to "latch on" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These entities are believed to be omnipresent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Exorcism, as a practice, aims to help individuals overcome [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonic possession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Understanding Demonic Afflictions

In the context of [[demonology_and_its_implications | demonology]], a demon is conceptualized as an "unwanted sickness" affecting the body, soul, or spirit, similar to how a cold or flu is an unwanted physical ailment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Ancient texts often referred to diseases like leprosy or convulsions as "demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The intention of discussions around these topics is to foster understanding of "darkness" to move towards "light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>.

### Symptoms and Manifestations
A person experiencing [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonic possession]] might exhibit:
*   Manic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Self-harm (e.g., trying to stab oneself) or aggression towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Physical strength beyond their normal capacity (e.g., a frail person lifting a sofa with one hand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   Vomiting and mouthing filthy language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   Acting in a "demonic way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   Episodes of trance or memory loss during manic phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   Misfortune, accidents, or discord within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   Desire to kill themselves or others, or engage in violent acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

It is a misconception that [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonic possession]] always involves overt physical manifestations like turning eyes or climbing walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Demons can possess individuals leading to subtle misfortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Causes of Possession
[[demonic_and_negative_energies | Demonic entities]] are said to "latch on" when a person displays vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This vulnerability can arise from "gaps" in one's aura, allowing for attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. Demons feed on negative emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. If a demon identifies one of these emotions, it may target the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

Being in a "contaminated" or "haunted" location while displaying fear can also make one susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. However, not every abandoned place is haunted, nor does every death in a house mean it is haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Hierarchy and Types of Demons
Satan is considered the leader of demons, often referred to as the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. However, it's suggested that there isn't necessarily a strict hierarchy among demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Demons are believed to be "programmed" like angels, with specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. For example, a demon of pancreatic cancer would not cause paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Demons can be categorized by the level of affliction they cause:
*   **Fluid-level demons**: Easy to dispel, affecting things like blood or tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.
*   **Flesh-level demons**: More difficult to heal, like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Bone-level demons**: Most permanent, like fractures, taking longer to heal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Soul-level demons**: Affecting one's aura (easily manipulated), energy (takes time to build), and consciousness (takes longer to regain, like from a coma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.
*   **Spirit-level demons**: Most potent, affecting motivation, conscience, and the deep memory that transcends lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. These can manipulate the mind and kill the conscience, leading individuals to believe wrong actions are right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

Demons are free radicals of energy that gain "spiritual memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. If this memory is positive, they form angels or spirit guides; if negative, they form demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>. There can also be neutral or "gray" entities that cause confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.

## The Exorcism Process

An exorcist's role is to help someone suffering from [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonic possession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. Dr. Savio Fado identifies as an exorcist and a psychic, applying a skeptical and scientific approach to [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. He emphasizes a scientific procedure, including the use of devices that measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

The most challenging aspect of dealing with a genuinely [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | haunted place]] is proving it is haunted and determining how the research can contribute to humanity's progress in understanding the paranormal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

### Diagnosis and Treatment
The first step in any therapy, including exorcism, is diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Identifying the specific demon is crucial for effective treatment, as each demon is believed to have its own weakness that can be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

Exorcisms are not always dramatic as depicted in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. They can be performed in a calm and relaxed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. The approach varies for each individual, as every person and every "mental illness" (or demonic affliction) is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. An exorcist may use religious texts like the Bible and scriptures, or spiritual procedures tailored to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. The process can take several hours, especially if the person is resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

It is important not to perform an exorcism when the possessed person is in a manic phase; one must wait until they are calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. The afflicted person may not be aware of their possession during the manic phase, but they realize their abnormal behavior once calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### Case Studies

#### The Half-Brothers
A particularly challenging case involved two boys, who were half-brothers, both acting demonically possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. One boy was the friend's son, and the other was the product of the friend's father's extramarital affair with the friend's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. Both boys exhibited similar manic behaviors synchronously, such as banging their heads or attempting to stab themselves or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

The connection was revealed through behavioral analysis and an awkward silence between the parents at a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. It was discovered that the father was engaged in illicit activities, and the boys' manic phases coincided with his indulgence in these acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. The challenge was how to resolve the situation without disrupting the family dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This difficult case resolved when the father committed suicide, leading to the cessation of the boys' manic phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. The exorcist pondered whether the resolution was due to his intervention, the universe, the father's actions, or the demon's self-annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Both boys are reportedly fine now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.

#### The Lady at the Temple
Another difficult case involved two warring entities at a dilapidated temple outside Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. The entities were ghosts of two humans with a history of rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. The backstory involved the son of a brick owner raping and killing the daughter of a worker, and the worker's mother (the "lady") then killed the brick owner's family in revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. This story, from the 1960s, was confirmed by locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

During the investigation, the exorcist was telepathically communicating with the outside entity, which was stubborn and refused to appear on gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. It confirmed its presence by making a distant dog stop barking instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. When the exorcist tried to re-enter the temple, the spirit physically manifested by transforming feeble creepers into thick branches to block his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This entity was particularly challenging because it was physically restraining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Such strong entities can manifest as dangerous animals like leopards or snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. The location was eventually "cleansed" through a ritual, forcefully crossing the entity over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. The lady's spirit had become powerful over the years, possibly feeding off the energy of rituals performed in the temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

## Spiritual Hygiene and Protection
Exorcists practice "spiritual hygiene" at the haunted location itself to prevent entities from latching on or following them home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This involves maintaining a constant meditative state, which increases the density of one's aura, thus driving away other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. A room where meditation or prayer is regularly performed also becomes protected and positive, as it fills with the meditator's aura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## Interaction with Entities
When interacting with [[paranormal_activities and supernatural_entities | entities]], an exorcist must approach with empathy, even if the entity has committed violent acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Communication with ghosts or demons is often telepathic, as they lack physical senses like sight or hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. Telepathic projection can use different mediums like light, air, water, or fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Entities do not always know they are ghosts; they may perceive themselves as normal humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. They see living people as ordinary individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. They only interact when their presence is acknowledged, as they have limited energy and will only expend it on those who recognize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Ghosts gather energy from sources like EMF, light, other entities, or even plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Entities that do not cross over often do so due to unfulfilled desires, such as concern for loved ones, attachment to property, or a desire for revenge after an unnatural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

## Objects and Portals
Entities can also reside within objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. Exorcists sometimes collect these "charged objects" from resolved cases, storing them in a contained manner, such as on top of a fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

Mirrors can potentially act as [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | portals]], or doorways, to other dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Specifically, two mirrors facing each other can create an endless loop, providing a "passage way" for entities from higher dimensions to enter this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. This concept aligns with practices in Vastu and Feng Shui, which advise against placing mirrors opposite each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

Natural [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | portals]] can also form where three or four elements interact, such as certain water bodies or trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. A house can become a portal if objects emitting high EMF (like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, or refrigerators) are arranged in a specific way, such as a triangular portion, leading to entities visually walking through walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

Entities, when visually perceived, often look like normal humans, reflecting their appearance in their previous life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Scary appearances are largely a cinematic portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

### Ouija Boards
A Ouija board, a common tool for [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | spirit communication]], is described as akin to a kindergarten book with letters and numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Its movement can be explained by the ideomotor effect, where subconscious micro-muscle twitches move the planchette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. Information derived from it often comes from the participants' subconscious memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. While largely scientific, it can still invite a demon or dead entity through manipulation or if the intention is there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>. It's compared to "playing blind dates with evil entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>.

### Occult Practices
What constitutes an "occult" thing depends on one's intention and belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. For example, a log of wood can be firewood or become a deity if worshiped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. Similarly, chanting "Bloody Mary" will only "work" if one intends it to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. Any form of [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | spirit communication]], whether through Ouija boards or gadgets, is a response to a stimulus and should be respected as such, regardless of skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

This article explores the complex relationship between India and China, drawing from a conversation that emphasizes civilian perspectives over purely geopolitical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. While there are significant [[geopolitical_discussions_related_to_india | geopolitical tensions]] between the two nations, it's important to understand the minds and hearts of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Current Relations and Media Perceptions
There is considerable [[geopolitical_relations_of_india_with_pakistan_and_china | geopolitical tension]] between India and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Two to three years ago, a border clash occurred between Chinese and Indian soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Indian media often portrays China as a "villain," creating a narrative of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This perspective is largely shaped by [[media_perceptions_and_geopolitical_tensions_between_india_and_china | media perceptions]], as a significant portion of the Indian population has not traveled outside India to gain a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Similarly, Chinese citizens also rely on media for their understanding of India, which presents both positive and negative aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:43:00">[31:43:00]</a>.

### Social Media and Information Flow
In China, popular global social media platforms like TikTok (known as Douyin in mainland China), Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix are banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>. Chinese people are proud that they have developed their own equivalent applications, such as Youku and Bilibili for video content like YouTube, and multiple platforms similar to Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>. While these apps are largely self-contained, some individuals use VPNs to access global platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:00">[36:39:00]</a>. In India, TikTok was banned a few years ago due to geopolitical concerns about data leakage to the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Societal Development
### Post-World War II Challenges
Following World War II, China faced severe challenges, including widespread poverty and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>. This difficult period, where people suffered from lack of food and adequate clothing, led to the implementation of the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. The policy aimed to control population growth to ensure better living conditions, food, and education for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. This policy has since been lifted, with families now permitted to have a second or even third child without restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

A significant figure in addressing China's food crisis was Mr. Yuan Longping, known as the "father of China's rice," who developed agricultural technology to double or triple rice yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:12]</a>.

### Leadership and Economic Growth
Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, are seen as actively engaging with the public by visiting factories, families, and villages to demonstrate government care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. This approach is similar to how India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspires the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. Under President Xi's rule, China has experienced rapid economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Similarly, India has seen advancements in technology and infrastructure, such as fast trains and new factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

Post-World War II, under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping (circa 1970s), China emphasized education, technology, and economic development to recover and strengthen the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. The government provides free medication and nine years of free education for all Chinese citizens, regardless of their ethnic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

### India-China War (1962) and Galwan Conflict (2020)
Indians are taught about the India-China War in the early 1960s, specifically concerning Aksai Chin in the northern part of India, which China took during the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. In India, this conflict is viewed as a result of military unpreparedness and lack of government backing at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>. While Chinese textbooks may briefly mention this, it's not deeply detailed for normal citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. More recently, the Galwan conflict, a border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers, occurred in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.

## Cultural Similarities and Differences
### Shared Values
Both Indian and Chinese people are deeply patriotic and proud of their respective countries and ancient histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. Education on history and culture is mandatory in Chinese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. Both nations face unique challenges due to their vast populations and limited livable land, requiring governments to make significant efforts to improve citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. Citizens in both countries generally prioritize personal and national growth over conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

### Language and Communication
Indians are generally better at English compared to Chinese people, which is seen as a marketing and talent-sending advantage for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. However, English education has become a priority in China, even from kindergarten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

### [[religion_and_belief_systems_in_india_and_china | Religion and Belief Systems]]
In China, there isn't a dominant religion, but many people believe in Buddhism, influenced by stories like "Journey to the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>. The new generation in China is largely non-religious, focusing instead on principles like karma, kindness, and self-improvement taught through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:00">[53:16:00]</a>. While the world may perceive China as atheist, the emphasis is on self-reliance and contributing to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.

India, in contrast, is a country with diverse religions, including Hinduism and Buddhism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. Hinduism, or Sanatan Dharma, is viewed as an eternal faith where a single divine energy expresses itself in various forms, leading to a multitude of gods and goddesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. A core belief in Hinduism is karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>. Buddhism, originating in India with Prince Siddhartha Gautama, shares principles of meditation and self-evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:19:00">[50:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>. Despite historical rivalries, there is now much peace and friendship between Buddhism and Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>.

Chinese people show interest in Indian religion, with some learning Yoga and visiting temples to pray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>. A remarkable encounter in Beijing involved a Chinese girl promoting Indian religion and teaching Hinduism to a visitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. This highlights the [[cultural_similarities_and_differences_between_india_and_china | cultural similarities and differences]] and cross-cultural curiosity.

### Vegetarianism and Food
Many Indians are vegetarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. While some Chinese regions, particularly Ningxia, have a high population of vegetarians and Muslims, finding strict vegetarian food in smaller Chinese cities might be challenging due to communication barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. However, big cities are accommodating, and vegetarian restaurants offering tofu-based dishes are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
Chinese people are curious about Indian food, especially street food, though its hygiene is a concern for foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.

### Love and Dating
Chinese people are generally perceived as shy and less romantic, prioritizing business, family, and making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. The younger generation may be more open to hookup culture, while traditionally, marriage is viewed with practicality, often considering a partner's ability to provide a better life rather than just love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. Parents historically imposed strict dating rules during school years, shifting pressure for marriage immediately after graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. Chinese men are generally seen as family-oriented, prioritizing their wives and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>.

### Bollywood in China
Bollywood films have a significant following in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. Aamir Khan is particularly famous, especially for his movie "Dangal," which earned more in China than in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>. "Three Idiots" is also a beloved Indian film in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>. Other actors like Hrithik Roshan and Salman Khan are also known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. Bollywood's unique blend of drama, song, and dance is noted by Chinese audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Specific Geopolitical Issues
### Tibet
From a Chinese citizen's perspective, Tibet is unequivocally a part of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>. China is a multicultural nation with 56 different ethnic groups or "nations," including Tibetans, Muslims (like the Uyghurs in Xinjiang), and Mongolians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:13">[01:56:13]</a>. While each group has its unique language and culture, they are all considered Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. The Chinese government allows Tibetans to learn their own language alongside Mandarin in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. Many Chinese people travel to Tibet for spiritual retreats, viewing it as a holy place, and experience welcoming interactions with locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.

However, in India, the narrative is that China took over Tibet, and Tibetan spiritual leaders, like the Dalai Lama, seek independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. It's believed that the Chinese government attempted to kill the Dalai Lama as a child and kidnapped another spiritual successor, the Panchen Lama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This issue is a sensitive point in [[chinas_geopolitical_challenges | China's Geopolitical Challenges]] and [[international_perspectives_on_india | international perspectives on India]].

### Territorial Claims
India perceives that China desires parts of its territory, such as Arunachal Pradesh in the East and Ladakh (where the Galwan clash occurred) near Tibet, as Chinese maps reportedly show these areas as part of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Indians believe the Chinese Communist Party aims for continuous land expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. From a Chinese civilian viewpoint, however, they assert that in recent history (past 10-30 years), China has not initiated wars or taken land from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. The focus internally is on national development, technology, and improving living standards rather than territorial conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

## Economic Growth and Technology
China is actively promoting learning in new technologies like AI and robotics, with government support for university majors in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. The development of hardware technology, such as flying cars, is seen as progressing faster in China than in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

India's growth strategy involves learning from both American technology and Chinese work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The Ambani family in India is highlighted as an example of significant national growth, having expanded their business across multiple industries and made internet access affordable for many Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>. Their philanthropic efforts and dedication to national development are respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>.

## Conclusion
Despite [[current_geopolitical_scenarios_in_israel_and_china | geopolitical tensions]], both Indian and Chinese citizens express a desire for friendship and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Direct "person meets person" conversations are crucial to bridge gaps created by media portrayals and political narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Recognizing [[cultural_similarities_and_differences_between_india_and_china | cultural similarities]], such as shared histories and love for their countries, can foster positive relations between the two most populous nations in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

Svarish Shashi, a young entrepreneur from India, attributes his success to his practice of celibacy and other spiritual disciplines. He has followed a "no sex and no fap" rule for nine years, genuinely believing it has provided him with a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His business, SVA (and its women-focused brand Diva Yoga), is a wellness startup grounded in authentic yoga practices, attracting investors like Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## A Journey of Transformation

Svarish describes his life in two distinct parts: before and after the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. His early life was characterized by arrogance and attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. He began yoga at age six, introduced by his parents to help him balance and focus for his dream of playing cricket for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

At 17, his serious [[Spiritual Growth and Sadhana | spiritual growth and sadhana]] began when he started attending classes with a new teacher, whom he later called 'Guruji' (one who brings you from darkness to light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Initially, he was intrigued by concepts like enlightenment and intuition, hoping it would help his cricket career selfishly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. His Guruji's honesty about enlightenment struck him, leading him to commit to the teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

He undertook various *sadhanas*, which means "discipline" in Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These included going silent for 40 days, meditating for nine hours a day, practicing Vipassana, and being mindful in all his actions and social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. He observed that every completed *sadhana* brought him one step ahead in his life, both personally and professionally, even leading to him becoming the captain of his college cricket team during a period he expected to be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The Five Precepts

His Guruji gave him five precepts, emphasizing that in yoga, commitment (*Sankalp*) is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>:

1.  **No intoxification:** Avoiding alcohol, smoking, and non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-violence:** Extending to actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Svarish genuinely does not remember the last time he even killed a mosquito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **No mental and physical stealing:** This means not coveting others' possessions or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Aspiring for one's own goals is acceptable, but not mentally stealing from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
4.  **No lying:** Not even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This discipline led to losing some friendships but eventually gained trust, as people knew he would always tell the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy:** The most challenging precept due to his age and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Celibacy meant no sex, no fap, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. His Guruji initially asked for a seven-year commitment, which Svarish has since surpassed, continuing the practice as a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Benefits of Spiritual Discipline

Svarish emphasizes that the combination of all five *sadhanas* has led to profound changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Semen Retention and Creative Energy
Semen retention is described as taking energy from the lower parts of the body upwards to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This process activates the right brain, opening up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This energy is linked to enhanced performance in various professions, improving focus and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The speaker himself mentions that after ejaculation, there is a sense of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

A simple yoga exercise to channel sexual energy involves visualizing the energy flowing up the spine into the brain with each deep breath, then spreading through the brain upon exhalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Advanced meditation schools like Osho, Isha Foundation, YSS, or Chinmaya Mission School teach practices to control and re-channel sexual energy into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

When encountering lustful feelings, Svarish is conscious of how to transform that energy into compassion and love for the other person and himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. This transformation shifts attraction from superficial physical aspects to a deeper understanding, viewing others with empathy rather than mere sexual desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Enhanced Intuition
A [[Spirituality and meditation | spiritual lifestyle]] and clean living can significantly increase intuitive power, or "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. This involves discerning vibes from people and situations and understanding what actions to take at life's crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. While Svarish has never consciously used his intuition for his career (as spirituality is about being in the present, not predicting the future) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>, he believes everyone possesses intuition and receives "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. He has experienced intuitive moments, like accurately predicting a friend's visa approval date and travel day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

He attributes such occurrences to manifestation, where deeply held beliefs materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. His childhood dream of doing a movie with Christopher Nolan and his adult aspiration for Jennifer Lopez to invest in his company both came true, which he sees as manifestation rather than coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Intuition is linked to the Ajna Chakra, or third eye, which can be opened through practices like pranayama, yoga, and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Negative thoughts and intoxicants can block this energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Meditation Practice
Svarish's intensive [[Spirituality meditation and maintaining a positive aura | meditation practice]] centers on *Anapana Vipassana*, which involves focusing on the normal and natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to observe thoughts without getting involved, allowing them to pass like "leaves in a river" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This practice, even for short durations like 30 seconds of unwavering focus, can significantly increase [[Personal growth and selfexploration | focus levels]] in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. One hour of yoga daily can provide 23 hours of energy and reduce sleep requirements to 4-6 hours of quality rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings

Svarish shares three core life lessons gleaned from his experiences:

1.  **Be true and authentic to yourself:** This is critical, even when difficult. Taking the first step is essential for any long journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. One must avoid being swayed or "bombarded" by external environments or peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
2.  **Practice self-care:** This encompasses both physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. There is a thin line between selfishness and selflessness; one must care for oneself to be able to care for and love others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. A mix of physical activities (like gym or functional training) and mindful practices (like breathing or meditation) is recommended to build self-belief, stay present, and continually improve oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a "people person":** Being good at people management is crucial for success, especially as a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, so being a good employer is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. This fosters compassion and improves relationships, which ultimately leads to a desire to share positive changes with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

His overarching philosophy is to "love like there is no tomorrow, and if tomorrow comes, love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

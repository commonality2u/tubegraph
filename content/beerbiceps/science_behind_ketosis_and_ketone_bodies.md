[[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | Ketosis]] is a metabolic state achieved through a [[importance_of_low_carb_intake_in_keto | super low-carb diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. While some studies suggest staying below 50g of carbohydrates, personal experience indicates that consistently staying below 20g of total daily carbohydrates is necessary for an effective [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This requires meticulous tracking of every food item, including even small additions like garlic pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. It's crucial to minimize sugar intake from carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:16">[02:04:16]</a>, leading to the avoidance of foods with high sugar content like onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers when aiming for [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>.

## How Ketosis Works
The body's primary and preferred energy source is carbohydrates, which are broken down into glucose and stored as glycogen in the muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. In a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], this carbohydrate fuel source is cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>. Without glucose from carbohydrates, the body turns to the glycogen stored in muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | Ketosis]] begins once these glycogen stores are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:12">[02:49:12]</a>.

Once glycogen runs out, the body undergoes biochemical processes to break down its own fat stores, converting them into "Ketone bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>. These Ketone bodies serve as alternative fuel tanks, performing the same function as glucose derived from carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:36">[03:04:36]</a>. Notably, 1 gram of Ketone bodies provides more energy than 1 gram of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:28">[03:15:28]</a>.

## Impact on Metabolism
The [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is considered a highly effective fat-burning diet because it alters the body's environment, causing it to utilize fat for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:42">[03:21:42]</a>. This means not only stored body fat but also dietary fat consumed can be used for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

### Metabolic Considerations and Downsides
While effective for fat burning, a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] still requires a caloric deficit to achieve fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Other considerations include:
*   **Strength Reduction** As with any cutting diet where weight is lost, some strength will be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:03">[03:49:03]</a>.
*   **Muscle Building** Building significant muscle mass is not expected on a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], as its primary purpose is fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a>. It is ideal for individuals looking to get "cut" after bulking or for general fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:02">[04:04:02]</a>.
*   **Keto Flu** This common side effect, though not an actual illness, involves symptoms like nausea, headaches, and fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:04">[04:16:04]</a>. It occurs because the body is depleting muscles of glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>. Working out can help reduce the duration of the keto flu by accelerating glycogen depletion and thus faster entry into [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:04">[04:37:04]</a>. Without exercise, it might last 4-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:04">[04:46:04]</a>.

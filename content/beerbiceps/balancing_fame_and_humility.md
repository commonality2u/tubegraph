## The Chanchlani Family Ethos

The Chanchlani family emphasizes the importance of [[the_power_of_humility_and_forgiveness | humility]] and staying grounded, even amidst significant public attention. They believe that true success is not measured by numbers or wealth, but by one's ability to maintain [[the_power_of_humility_and_forgiveness | humility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Ashish Chanchlani's parents instilled in him from childhood that success holds more importance than money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Humility as a Core Strength

Both Ashish and Muskan Chanchlani are described as very [[the_power_of_humility_and_forgiveness | humble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and down to earth, which is considered their greatest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Their parents note their respectful interactions with everyone, from their cook to their watchman, speaking with warmth and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They never show jealousy towards others' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, instead feeling positive about the hard work of their peers, like Amit Bhadana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Parental Guidance on Fame

The Chanchlani parents actively guide their children in [[managing_fame_and_family_reactions | coping with fame]]. Ashish's father advised him that while [[dealing_with_public_attention_and_celebrity_life | fame]] and numbers might come, it's crucial to remember one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He observed that people can become "a little crazy" after gaining wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

His father also taught him by example, exposing him to film stars like Aamir Khan and Sunny Deol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This taught Ashish that celebrities' relevance often hinges on their latest film's success; a flop can quickly diminish public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This fostered an understanding that the hunger for success, rather than money, leads to [[the_power_of_humility_and_forgiveness | humility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## The Nature of Success and Identity

Ashish's journey reflects his desire to build his own identity rather than relying on his family's wealth. Despite his grandfather being a prominent figure, Ashish's father chose to forge his own path, teaching Ashish not to flaunt money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Ashish himself never wanted to show off his money or status as "the son of a big father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, aspiring instead to be independent and self-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This focus on creating his own identity is a key lesson he learned from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

His mother emphasizes staying positive and optimistic, believing something good can emerge from every situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Both parents taught their children to never give up and to always treat everyone with love and respect, regardless of how they are treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Parental Advice for Aspiring Individuals

Ashish's mother advises parents of children pursuing unconventional careers to allow them space to explore. She suggests giving children at least a year to try their chosen path before forming conclusions, encouraging parents to let their children "fly" like a bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. She highlights that excessive restriction can lead to confusion in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Ashish's father's advice to his children is to love what they do, take care of their health, and live a disciplined life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This holistic approach supports their journey in [[coping_with_fame_and_privacy | public life]] while maintaining their personal well-being and values.

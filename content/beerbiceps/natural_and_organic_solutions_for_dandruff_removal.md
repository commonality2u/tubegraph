Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can often be managed with home-based treatments and a mindful approach to hair care and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Understanding Dandruff

Dandruff forms when the scalp, an active environment constantly producing and shedding skin cells, becomes oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The dead skin cells collect and mix with oil, forming the visible white flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

It's important to distinguish between two types of dandruff:
*   **Common Dandruff** White flakes fall from the head, which is not inherently harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While potentially embarrassing, it's generally manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This article focuses on solutions for this type of dandruff.
*   **Seborrheic Dermatitis** This more severe form of dandruff includes white flakes accompanied by intense itching of the scalp and areas around the hairline, including the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It can also lead to boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist instead of relying on home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

For most individuals with common dandruff, these four secrets can help achieve a cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | Hair Care Routine Adjustments]]

Dandruff can be influenced by imbalances in [[benefits_and_methods_of_hair_oiling | hair oiling]], shampooing, and conditioning â€” whether too little or too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

*   **Oiling:** Oil acts as a "fertilizer" for the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Aim to oil your hair two to three times a week to prevent the scalp from becoming too dry, which contributes to dead skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Do not exceed this frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Shampooing:** If you have dandruff, use an anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For regular hair care, shampoo your hair twice or thrice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Avoid daily shampooing, as it can strip the hair of its natural protective layer of oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This aligns with [[choosing_the_right_shampoo_for_hair_health | choosing the right shampoo for hair health]].
*   **Conditioning:** Conditioners are oil-based, so excessive use can make the scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Use conditioner every time you use a mild shampoo, but maintain balance without overdoing or underdoing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Hair Product Usage:** Many people experience dandruff due to excessive hair product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. When applying hair products like wax, gels, clays, serums, or creams, ensure they are applied to the body of your hair and do not come into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Contact with the scalp can exacerbate dandruff problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### [[role_of_environment_in_managing_dandruff | Environmental Care]]

Since dandruff is considered an infection, caring for your immediate environment is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Pillowcases:** Regularly clean your pillowcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Even with anti-dandruff products, if the environment remains infested, dandruff can return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. To sanitize, dip pillowcases in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) and leave them for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes:** Apply the same antiseptic cleaning method to your regularly used combs and brushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear and Accessories:** Clean all types of headgear, including caps, hats, and helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Similarly, any hair bands or hair clips that come into contact with your scalp should be washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Home Remedies and Scalp pH Balance

Understanding skin pH is key to effective home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The natural pH of healthy skin is around 5.5, which is slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This acidity helps kill harmful bacteria and infections, acting as a protective layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For individuals with dandruff, the scalp's pH may be imbalanced, becoming less acidic than it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many anti-dandruff products work by restoring this acidic pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Natural products that are slightly acidic can help cure dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These include:
*   Curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV):** This is a highly recommended natural remedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Ensure you use organic apple cider vinegar that specifies "with the mother" on the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Mix it with a small amount of water to create a slightly diluted solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Apply this solution directly onto your scalp to cleanse it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos

Using an anti-dandruff shampoo at least once a week is advised for dandruff sufferers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, many conventional anti-dandruff shampoos contain harmful chemicals like sulfates and parabens, which can damage hair quality over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

To avoid this, opt for high-quality organic hair products, specifically those that are sulfate and paraben-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, aligning with the principles of [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | natural versus chemical skincare products]]. These organic options can help restore the scalp's correct pH and treat dandruff while maintaining overall hair quality in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. An example of such a product is Wow Apple Cider Shampoos, which is sulfate and paraben-free and helps cure dandruff while maintaining hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

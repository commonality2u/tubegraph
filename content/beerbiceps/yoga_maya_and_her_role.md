[[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]], also referred to as [[Role and practice of Tantra and Sadhana | Maya Shakti]], plays a crucial and mystical role in the life and *leelas* (divine play) of Krishna. Her presence is integral to the extraordinary events surrounding Krishna's birth and subsequent interactions with the world [01:11:51].

## Birth and Concealment
[[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] is introduced in the narrative as the baby girl born to Nanda and Yashoda on the same night Krishna was born to Vasudeva and Devaki [01:11:34]. Krishna instructs Vasudeva to swap him with this baby girl [01:12:07]. What many do not know is that along with the baby girl, Yashoda also gave birth to a beam of light [01:12:47]. When Vasudeva placed Krishna in Nanda and Yashoda's house, Krishna and this beam of light merged [01:13:02]. This signifies that the [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] born to Nanda and Yashoda is the manifestation of Krishna's eternal *swarupam* (divine form) from Goloka, merging with Vishnu's form from Vaikuntha [01:13:51].

### Role in Delusion (Moharatri)
One of [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]]'s primary functions is to cause delusion. The night Krishna was born is called Moharatri (the night of delusion) [01:14:00]. By virtue of [[Yoga Maya and her role | Maya]] being born, "nobody knows what's happening" [01:12:00]. When [[Yoga Maya and her role | Maya]] operates on Krishna's instruction, "everyone gets deluded" [01:13:53]. This delusion explains why Nanda and Yashoda didn't realize they had a baby girl, or why the guards in Kamsa's jail became sleepy, allowing Vasudeva to escape [01:14:31].

### Reassurance and Subhadra
After Vasudeva returns to the jail with the baby girl, her presence reassures him and Devaki, a concept called *bhadram* in Sanskrit [01:14:21]. She delivers the good news that their "killer is on the other side of Yamuna and your killer will come for you" [01:14:50]. This [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya Shakti]] later becomes Subhadra, the sister of Krishna, and is worshipped alongside Krishna and Balarama in Puri Jagannath [01:14:28].

### Transfer of Balarama
[[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] was also instrumental in the miraculous transfer of Balarama, Krishna's elder brother. Balarama was the seventh child conceived by Devaki [01:15:02]. Vishnu instructs [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] to "pull this baby out of Devaki's womb and place her in another lady's womb" named Rohini, where he could grow safely [01:15:09]. This careful pulling (Sankarana) is also the origin of Balarama's name, Sankarshana [01:15:47].

### Delusion of the Gopis
Later in Krishna's life, [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] plays a role in the *Rasalila*. When the [[The role of Radha in Krishnas life | gopikas]] dance with Krishna, they briefly think they have him under their control, a "meager... floating thought" of *ahankaram* (ego) [01:15:37]. The second this thought arises, Krishna disappears [01:15:39]. This disappearance is attributed to [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]], who deludes them into thinking the same thing, clearing them of their *ahankaram* before Krishna returns for the *Rasalila*, the "dance of complete abandon" [01:15:37].

In essence, [[Yoga Maya and her role | Yoga Maya]] serves as the divine power that both obscures and reveals, creates delusion and facilitates divine experiences, ensuring that Krishna's *leelas* unfold according to his will.

Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can be effectively managed with a proper hair care routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding the types of dandruff and common hair care mistakes is crucial for successful treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Types of Dandruff

There are two primary types of dandruff:
*   **Common Dandruff** This type involves white flakes falling off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is generally not harmful but can be an embarrassing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Seborrheic Dermatitis** This more severe form of dandruff is characterized by white flakes accompanied by intense itching in the scalp region, as well as areas around the hairline and ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It can also cause boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

For most people, common dandruff can be cured through specific "secrets" related to hair care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Hair Care Mistakes to Avoid

Dandruff forms when the scalp, an active environment constantly producing and shedding skin cells, becomes too oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The dead skin cells then mix with oil to form the white flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Dandruff can be caused by either too little or too much of key hair care practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Hair Oiling
[[benefits_and_methods_of_hair_oiling | Oiling]] your hair is beneficial, acting like a fertilizer for the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Oil your hair at least two to three times a week, but no more than that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Why**: An overly dry scalp contributes to dead skin cell accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Hair Shampooing
[[choosing_the_right_shampoo_for_hair_health | Shampooing]] plays a vital role in [[importance_of_haircuts_and_maintaining_clean_hair | maintaining clean hair]].
*   **Frequency**: Use shampoo twice or thrice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Anti-Dandruff Shampoo**: If you have dandruff, use an anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-shampooing**: Shampooing your hair every day can strip it of its natural protective layer of oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Hair Conditioning
Conditioners are oil-based substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Condition your hair every time you use a mild shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Do not overdo or underdo conditioning, as too much can make your scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Hair Product Usage
Excessive hair product usage is a common cause of dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Application**: When applying hair products like wax, gels, clays, serums, or creams, ensure they do not come into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These products should be applied to the body of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Why**: Applying products to the scalp can increase your dandruff problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## [[role_of_environment_in_managing_dandruff | Environmental Factors]]

Dandruff is an infection, so caring for your environment is crucial for effective dandruff treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Pillowcases**: Clean your pillowcases regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Dip them in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) for at least 12 hours to get rid of dandruff-causing elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes**: Regularly clean your combs and brushes using the same antiseptic solution method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear**: Anything that comes into contact with your scalp, such as caps, hats, helmets, hair bands, and hair clips, should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Home Remedies and Scalp pH

Understanding your skin's pH is important for [[secrets_to_curing_dandruff_at_home | home remedies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Skin pH**: Your skin's pH is typically 5.5, meaning it is slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This acidity acts as a protective layer, killing harmful bacteria and infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Dandruff and pH**: For those suffering from dandruff, their scalp's pH may be off and not acidic enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many anti-dandruff products work by correcting this pH balance to be more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Acidic Natural Products**: Any natural product that is slightly acidic can help cure dandruff by setting the scalp's pH right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Examples include curd and lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar**: A personal favorite [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | natural solution]] is apple cider vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Make sure to use organic apple cider vinegar "with the mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Mix it with a little water to create a dilute solution and apply it to your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>; it cleanses the scalp similarly to curd or lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos

While [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | natural remedies]] are helpful, a good quality organic hair product is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Necessity**: If you have dandruff, using an anti-dandruff shampoo at least once a week is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Chemicals**: Be aware that most conventional anti-dandruff shampoos contain sulfates, parabens, and other harmful chemicals that can damage hair quality in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Organic Shampoos**: Organic shampoos that are sulfate and paraben-free help set the scalp's pH right and cure dandruff in the long term, while also maintaining hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

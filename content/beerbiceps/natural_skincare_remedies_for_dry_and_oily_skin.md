This article provides skincare tips focusing on achieving healthy, glowing skin through natural remedies and proper care, rather than attempting to change genetic skin color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. The pursuit of "fairness" is rooted in historical imperialism, which propagated the idea of white skin being superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>, a mentality that unfortunately persists in many Asian, African, and South American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. It's important to remember that skin color is genetic and should not be changed, but rather optimized to be its best version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Avoid Skin Whitening Products

It is strongly advised not to chase skin whitening or use skin whitening creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. These products can harm your face in the long term, often containing hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, steroids, and other harmful substances that degrade skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Skincare for Different Skin Types

### Dry Skin

If you have dry skin, a moisturizer is your best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. After washing your face and completely drying it with a towel, apply a mild moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. For really dry lips, you can apply a moisturizer or even petroleum jelly like Vaseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This routine helps achieve glowing, healthy skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>.

[[moisturizers_and_their_effects_on_acne_and_bacteria | Moisturizers]] are particularly helpful for dry skin that tends to flake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>.

### Oily Skin

For those with [[skincare_routine_for_men_with_oily_skin | oily skin]], a [[natural_and_herbal_face_wash_recommendations | home remedy]] using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. Fuller's Earth can be found at any Indian grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

**Multani Mitti Face Pack:**
1.  **Preparation:** Chip off a piece of Fuller's Earth and pound it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Mixture:** Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric (haldi) into the powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Squeeze a little lemon juice into it to create a slight paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. If too dry, add a few drops of water to achieve a smooth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
3.  **Application:** Apply a thin layer of this mixture onto your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
4.  **Duration:** Let it dry, but do not keep it on for longer than 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
5.  **Removal:** Wash it off thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

**Benefits of the Mixture:**
*   Turmeric cleanses the face and acts as an antiseptic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   Lemon helps increase the glow of your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   Fuller's Earth absorbs excess oil from the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

**Usage Frequency:**
*   Do not use this mixture more than once or twice a week, ideally with a gap of 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Overuse can cause the skin to secrete even more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. You may see a change in your face within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Exfoliation for Glowing Skin

To achieve glowing, "baby-type" skin, use a face scrub, which is a face wash containing small, hard particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

**How to Exfoliate:**
*   Massage your face firmly in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   Press hard enough to feel a slight tingling sensation, but do not press too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   The hard particles increase blood circulation to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   Increased blood circulation promotes new skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

**Important Caution:**
*   Do not use this method if you are [[antiacne_products_and_natural_solutions | very acne-prone]] or currently have acne, as it can harm inflammations on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   For non-acne prone skin, exfoliation is effective for healthy, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   Exfoliate no more than once a week, perhaps on the same day you might use the Multani Mitti pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## [[importance_of_diet_and_lifestyle_for_skin_health | The Role of Diet for Clear, Glowing Skin]]

Focusing on your [[dietary_advice_for_healthy_glowing_skin | diet]] is a significant hack for clear, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

*   **Hydration:** Keep yourself hydrated throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. A good indicator is clear urine for most of the day; if it's slightly yellow, drink more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Prioritize vegetables over fruits, as vegetables are more nutritionally dense, providing more vitamins and minerals for the same amount of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. A quick rule of thumb is to consume a variety of colored vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Embrace Your Natural Skin Tone

Ultimately, confidence and positivity are key to attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. People are attracted to internal qualities more than external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. The most important step is to learn to be comfortable in your own skin and love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Your skin color is how you are born and will remain for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, as all skin types are considered beautiful today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Promoting the idea that dark skin doesn't look good is essentially promoting racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

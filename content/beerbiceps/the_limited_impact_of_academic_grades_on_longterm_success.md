The conventional belief that academic marks dictate future happiness and success is largely a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While marks may influence the initial stages of a career, their long-term impact is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## True Determinants of Success
Success, encompassing money, fame, and overall achievement, is primarily shaped by two factors:
*   The ability to work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
*   Possessing the correct career mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

Developing one's mindset is crucial before entering the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Short Shelf-Life of Academic Achievements
Academic marks are relevant only for the first five to ten years of one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Beyond this period, factors such as the college attended or specific scores in subjects like mathematics become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

What truly matters in the long run includes:
*   Proficiency in one's chosen field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   The quality of one's character as a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   The passion and love invested in all endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>

## Reframing Pressure and Failure
Pressure from parents and teachers regarding academic performance often stems from their desire to protect their own reputations or as a form of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A poor score is merely a "small dot" on the expansive timeline of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Instead of being defined by marks, future success is determined by the "hustle" and continuous effort throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This involves striving to become the best version of oneself and embracing self-love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## A Formula for Success
A three-point formula for achieving success in life emphasizes:
1.  Love for people and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
2.  Gratitude for all blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
3.  [[importance_of_focus_for_success | Focus]] on happiness and the positive aspects of one's situation, life, and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

Ultimately, recognizing one's inherent worth and beauty is a crucial step towards personal fulfillment and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Personal Perspective on Relationships

The interviewee states that her current void in life is that her [[marriage_and_relationships | relationship]] part is not completely sorted yet, though she believes it will be in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:05">[06:21:05]</a>. She feels that romantic relationships are challenging for someone like her who is a "hustler" and "lives out of a suitcase," making it difficult for anyone dating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Generational Challenges

Both the interviewee and the interviewer acknowledge that the difficulty with romantic [[marriage_and_relationships | relationships]] is a "generation problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:06">[06:34:06]</a>. They observe that the previous generation found it easier to prioritize their partner, a trait less common in today's generation, which tends to be more self-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. The interviewee emphasizes that [[marriage_and_relationships | relationships]] and friendships are fundamentally about care, even before love, as "love" has become a "ruined" term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

The pressure to "settle" by a certain age is also discussed, particularly for women in their mid-20s to early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. The interviewee questions why this generation is pushed to settle when it can be "unsettling" for many who would not choose it if given their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

## Idea of Marriage

The interviewee believes one should marry when they find a person they genuinely want to live with, and when that person adds value to their life, making it "nice and fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. This is her personal idea of marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

For determining compatibility before [[marriage_and_relationships | marriage]], she suggests that traveling with a partner is the "next best thing" after living together, especially in India where live-in relationships are not as common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

## Qualities in an Ideal Partner

An ideal partner should not make you "walk on eggshells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. If day-to-day life becomes stressful because of a partner, such relationships are unlikely to last, even if there's good chemistry or a "soul connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. Good chemistry does not always equate to compatibility, and relationships starting with "a lot of fire" often see that fire fizzle out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

The interviewee still believes in "perfect romance" with the right person, drawing inspiration from her parents' idealistic [[marriage_and_relationships | romance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. She feels her parents' high standard has made it difficult for her to find a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

She desires a partner who is self-made, as she is also self-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>. This shared quality implies valuing every penny and understanding that success requires hard work, which contributes to the desired values for a future family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>. Additionally, a self-made journey adds a unique layer to one's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>.

## Learning from Relationships

The interviewee believes that individuals often fall victim to their own patterns in failed [[marriage_and_relationships | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. For her, "getting out of that pattern" was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. She has had "amazing people" as ex-partners and holds no hatred for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

She also learns from "action" and "experience." Despite knowing about good [[marriage_and_relationships | relationships]], she acknowledges that she hasn't had perfect ones because humans are driven by hormones and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>.

### Love Languages
The interviewer explains the concept of "love languages" as ways partners express love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>:
*   **Physical:** Expressing love through hugs, kisses, and holding hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.
*   **Verbal:** Saying "I love you" or similar affirmations, often seen in poets or writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **Quality Time:** Spending time together, valuing presence over interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. The interviewee identifies with this, liking to be physically present around a person without needing to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.
*   **Material Love:** Expressing love through giving expensive gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.

## Pressures of Fame on Relationships and Personal Life

As an actress, the interviewee finds the "fame fame part" of her job difficult because it leaves "really no privacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. While many believe acting is empowering, she feels it makes one "a lot more vulnerable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. There is "moral policing," and every step taken is influenced by "what will people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Memes have shown that what people think can ruin lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

There are constant [[expectations_in_relationships | expectations]] to be presentable, even when feeling unwell or going through trauma, as fans will still ask for selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. After recovering from COVID-19 and being on heavy medication, people commented on her appearance, which she found insensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35:00">[40:35:00]</a>.

Actresses face intense pressure related to looks, makeup, and age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>. Male actors, however, face "worse" pressures, primarily financial, due to the large sums of money riding on their films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>. When a film bombs, the "brickbats" they receive are far more severe than what actresses experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.

Regarding dating, the interviewee suggests that actresses might prefer partners from outside the film industry to bring a different perspective to their lives, avoiding a situation where both partners only discuss their shared profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.

## Motherhood and Career Balance

The interviewee expresses a deep desire to work with kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>. She hopes to have children in the future, but admits she is "a little scared about motherhood" because she feels she would have to "dissolve" herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. She plans to balance her career and motherhood, as she cannot live without her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>.

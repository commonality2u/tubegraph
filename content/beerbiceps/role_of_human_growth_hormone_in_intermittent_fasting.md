Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is a crucial hormone involved in metabolism and body composition. While high in younger individuals, its levels naturally decline with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. [[Science of intermittent fasting and its benefits|Intermittent fasting (IF)]] significantly influences HGH levels, making it a key factor in its proposed benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## HGH Levels in Different Age Groups

HGH is particularly high in young adults and individuals in their late teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Males typically grow until around 21 years old, and females until about 18, during which their HGH levels remain very elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This high HGH allows younger people to consume more junk food without significant negative impacts on their physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. As individuals age, their HGH levels progressively decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Under normal circumstances for adults, HGH is secreted into the bloodstream primarily at night during sleep, typically in two spurts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The consumption of meals suppresses the release of HGH in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Intermittent Fasting and HGH Increase

A primary goal of [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science|intermittent fasting]] is to increase the body's HGH levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This is achieved by entering a fasting state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Studies on individuals practicing [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science|IF]] show two major HGH spurts, one of which is significantly larger than what is typically observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This occurs because fasting "fools" the body into perceiving a potential state of starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Even though actual starvation is defined as four days without food, the 16-hour fasting period in [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science|IF]] is perceived as a "shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. In response, the body increases HGH levels to cope with the perceived lack of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

While HGH release occurs even after a 12-hour fast, a 16-hour fasting window with an 8-hour eating window is generally recommended for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Research suggests that the longer one fasts, the more HGH is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Some studies have indicated that subjects experienced a 250% increase in their HGH levels after a 36-hour fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Importantly, this increase in HGH through [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science|IF]] is considered healthy and does not harm the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Increased HGH in Adults

In young adults, HGH aids significantly in [[role_of_protein_intake_in_muscle_recovery|muscle recovery]], muscle and bone growth, and contributes to [[height_growth_during_teenage_years|height growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. For adults who have reached their full height potential (typically over 21 years old), increased HGH offers several key benefits:

*   **Muscle Recovery and Repair** HGH primarily assists in [[role_of_protein_intake_in_muscle_recovery|muscle recovery]] and repair from daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Fat Mobilization** It significantly aids in fat mobilization, which is the body's process of burning fat for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Higher HGH levels make it easier to build muscle mass and burn fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Protein Sparing** HGH acts as a "protein sparer," signaling the body to preserve muscle mass and burn fat, especially when food is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. The more HGH present, the more efficiently the body can burn fat while saving muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

Together with insulin, HGH contributes to nutrient repartitioning, making the body more efficient at utilizing food to build muscle mass rather than storing it as fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This essentially helps transform the body into a "fat-burning machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

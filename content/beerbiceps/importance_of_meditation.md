They play a significant role in one's spiritual journey, leading to a profound understanding of life's true values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*   **Spiritual Advancement**
    *   The primary method in Himalayan Buddhism is to transform oneself into a Buddha or a pure being, which is achieved through consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
    *   Intense [[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | meditation]] can accumulate a "volcanic amount of karma," accelerating one's path towards Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

    *   [[Meditation and its effects on sleep and consciousness | Meditation]] provides a profound level of rest for the soul, mind, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>.
    *   Even sleeping for a few hours after meditating can feel like a full eight hours of rest, indicating its deep restorative power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.

## Practices and Disciplines

Monastic life, particularly for a Rinpoche or Tulu (magically reborn spiritual guru), involves a very strict daily routine centered around spiritual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This includes waking up early (e.g., 5 AM) for whole-day [[Role of spirituality and meditation in daily life | meditation]] and chanting, sometimes with only short breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. This rigorous discipline is essential for preparing future spiritual leaders for their teaching responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

### Tumo (Kundalini Yoga)
A significant practice in Himalayan Buddhism is Tumo, part of the Six Yogas of Naropa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. This secret practice involves invoking the inner fire channel of the body through specific pranams, breathings, and yoga movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
*   **Process**: Practitioners prepare for one to two months, then meditate outdoors in the Himalayan mountains during the coldest days of mid-January (temperatures can reach -25 to -30 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. They wear only a belt and special underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Through breathing and visualization, the body generates so much heat that practitioners sweat, and the snow around them melts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Sometimes, wet shawls are wrapped around the body as a "mini-competition" to see how many can be dried through generated body heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The goal is not fame or being "cool," but to use this inner fire to burn negative emotions and inflame compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. Successfully performing Tumo can lead to "deino," or great joy, a constant, almost orgasmic feeling of happiness throughout the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

## The Path to Renunciation and Happiness

True renunciation stems from an inner realization rather than merely giving up external things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This realization can come through karmic circumstances or deep trauma, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, which served as a "wakeup call" for many to realize the futility of material wealth in the face of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. Suffering can help one renounce superficial attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

There are generally two types of individuals who embrace spirituality in material life: those born into a spiritual family and those who undergo significant suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the most crucial aspect of renunciation is abstaining from negative emotions such as jealousy, greed, attachment, and ego, rather than solely focusing on external vices like alcohol or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. While abstaining from external things can be beneficial initially to avoid getting "caught up," true [[The impact of meditation on brain function | spiritual advancement]] involves realizing that the things one wishes to renounce are primarily internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.

Meditation, therefore, is crucial for fostering inner peace and cultivating compassion, allowing individuals to find true happiness from within rather than in impermanent external phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>. By understanding that everything external is compounded and impermanent, one can avoid the addictive cycle of chasing transient pleasures and instead cultivate lasting happiness through inner work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

An app called "Level Supermind" is available on the App Store and Play Store to help individuals begin their meditation journey, with the belief that "irrespective of how difficult your present is, your future becomes easier through [[Importance and impact of meditation and spiritual practices | meditation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

[[Experiences of Major Vivek Jacob in the Indian Special Forces | Major Vivek Jacob]], a legendary figure in the Indian Army and a veteran of the Indian Paras SF, has extensively shared his insights on [[Challenges and experiences of military operations | military operations]] and [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Indian Paras SF is regarded as the most advanced unit within the Indian Army and is globally recognized as one of the most respected regiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article delves into the unique [[Special Forces mindset and mentality | mindset]] and [[Survival Stories in Extreme Conditions | survival strategies]] cultivated within the [[Indian Special Forces | Indian Special Forces]], shaped by rigorous training and intense combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Special Forces Mindset

The essence of [[Indian Special Forces | Special Forces]] lies in a particular state of mind, characterized by an exploratory nature and a willingness to commit everything, even one's life, to deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This mindset is not about being "badass" but about efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, rooted in an "exploratory spirit" that leads to action on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Members choose to constantly experience and explore, even when facing extreme danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The core philosophy is to be free, manifesting as a constant desire to know and explore more, often placing life on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This means being able to set aside personal attachments like family to operate at the cutting edge of life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Three baseline levels of consciousness are identified: follower, leader, and explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. All human beings operate within these spheres, shifting depending on circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The ultimate goal is to raise awareness levels and embrace a spirit of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## Selection and Training: Breaking Down to Build Up

The selection process for [[Indian Special Forces | Special Forces]] is incredibly intense, designed to dissolve ego and self-perceptions through extreme physical, mental, and emotional expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. This "time-tested set of circumstances" breaks individuals down to reveal their true essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. The primary question during selection is: "Do I want to walk with this man in [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] or not?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

A crucial first step is volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. It requires immense courage to sign up, knowing the high chance of failure and the potential disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Once selected, life shifts the moment one enters the unit's gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Everything is stripped away, bringing individuals into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

The training is a dual process of being shattered and trained simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. It covers skill sets such as:
*   Explosive training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>
*   Unarmed [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   Weapon training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>
*   Endurance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   Navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>
*   Emergency medical first response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>
*   [[Survival Stories in Extreme Conditions | Survival training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>

This training pushes individuals to their limits, with days starting early or continuing from the previous day without sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Officers and soldiers train, live, and eat together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Mental pressure is constant, for instance, an officer might be forced to memorize unit history and general knowledge, with failure leading to grueling physical punishments like all-night guard checks, followed by demanding physical endurance tests where top performance is mandatory despite exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

The process aims to assess and cultivate the ability to make and stick to a choice, especially in the face of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Those who remain possess a "pure core" and realize that "nothing is impossible," which becomes their chief weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

## Combat Experiences: The Ultimate Test

While training prepares soldiers, no training can truly match [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Combat is the ultimate test and a continuous training process that further tears and shapes a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. It is a constant engagement with the duality of life and death, forcing rapid evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

### The Role of Instinct and Efficiency
In [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]], pure instinct takes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. Years of ingrained training make the body work by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. For example, a weapon becomes an extension of the body through constant proximity and training, allowing for instinctive, accurate targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. In the chaotic, split-second nature of most combat encounters, "one shot is a 10" (a perfect hit) is the survival imperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

### Intuition and Leadership
With extensive [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] experience, a soldier's [[Understanding consciousness and intuition in military scenarios | intuition]] becomes incredibly powerful, leading to accurate predictions and immediate actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. This [[Understanding consciousness and intuition in military scenarios | intuition]] translates into effectiveness even outside the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

In [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]], formal ranks hold no authority; true leadership emerges from those who can take responsibility and act decisively amid chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. Respect is earned not by rank, but by demonstrating one's true self in dire situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. Love for one's team is paramount for survival and efficiency, as failure means paying a price in blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

### A Difficult Mission and the Power of Love
One of [[Experiences of Major Vivek Jacob in the Indian Special Forces | Major Jacob's]] most challenging [[Challenges and experiences of military operations | missions]] involved the injury of a team member deep within hostile, treacherous terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. Despite the immense difficulty, his team remained remarkably calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. They had to extract a gravely wounded soldier with a blown-off leg, a situation that normally would be fatal given the remote location and lack of medical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

Within five minutes, the small team, heavily laden with gear, administered morphine, started an IV, bandaged the spurting wound, and stabilized the soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. This was possible due to their training, but ultimately, "Only Love can actually get something out like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. The injured soldier, despite his horrific wound, showed incredible fortitude, remaining calm and even offering to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. A young, new team member, driven by this bond, carried the wounded soldier on his back up a jagged mountain for two nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

This [[Survival Stories in Extreme Conditions | survival story]] highlights the team's ability to act with precise efficiency even when the chaos was absolute, enabled by their deep trust and love for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

### Facing Personal Dread
In another instance, during a prolonged mission, [[Experiences of Major Vivek Jacob in the Indian Special Forces | Major Jacob]] experienced an unprecedented feeling of dread and a desire to leave [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Despite this intense internal turmoil, he suppressed the feeling and chose to remain, ultimately leading to a successful resolution of an ambush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

### Ambush and Instantaneous Leadership
During an ambush in a barren mountain area, when a machine gun fire erupted and the entire team dropped for cover, [[Experiences of Major Vivek Jacob in the Indian Special Forces | Major Jacob]], then a new officer, instinctively realized that "the man who stands now and returns fire, he's the leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. He stood up and returned fire, prompting others to follow suit and regain control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. This demonstrates that in combat, leadership is not bestowed but instantly manifested by action.

## Combat's Transformative Effect
[[Experiences of Major Vivek Jacob in the Indian Special Forces | Major Jacob]] has never been hit by a bullet or lost a team member in 9.5 years of [[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This isn't luck but a result of choice, constant testing, and being able to find clarity within chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. He describes instances where he was surrounded by enemies, yet faced them without fear, pushing beyond the fear of death to gain deeper insights into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. In such moments, his entire life flashed before his eyes, an experience beyond time, happening instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

This intense exposure to "out of control chaos" provides a unique realization: the more chaos, the more centered one must become, leading to greater efficiency and higher chances of survival for oneself and loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

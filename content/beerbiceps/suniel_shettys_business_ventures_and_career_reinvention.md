Suniel Shetty, widely known as an actor, also possesses a significant and thriving business career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He has recently undertaken a period of self-reinvention and a return to his work in entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Business Ventures and Entrepreneurship

Suniel Shetty has been involved in numerous businesses beyond the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His entrepreneurial journey began early, stemming from a background in the hospitality business, where his father started by cleaning tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. He views work as worship, a principle instilled from his hospitality roots, where the customer was always paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:54">[02:24:54]</a>.

One of his notable early ventures was a gaming parlor called Astro Mischief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>. He continued to pursue his entrepreneurial side, initially as a "small skill guy" in what might now be called an MSME or startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>. This entrepreneurial pursuit provided him with confidence, showing him he was "a lot more in life than what that man believes I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:30">[02:47:30]</a>.

He emphasizes that money has never been his primary motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:29">[02:46:29]</a>. Despite having done 130 films, he estimates he probably wasn't fully paid for a minimum of 100 of them, but this has never bothered him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:57">[02:46:57]</a>. He believes that if one focuses on giving without expectation, good things return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:45">[02:44:45]</a>. His approach to business is rooted in caring for his employees, aiming to add more people to his team rather than offloading them, even during challenging times like the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.

## Career Reinvention and Return to Acting

After an approximately 8-year break from acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, Suniel Shetty is re-entering the entertainment industry with a focus on enjoying his work and making it meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. He sees this return as a "launch as a senior citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

His appearance and fitness are a significant part of his reinvention. He attributes his youthful look to focusing on health and wellness, which has been a consistent factor in his life, regardless of career success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He challenged himself to be the "fittest 50 ever" and managed to achieve a "sixpack at 60" primarily through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This emphasis on [[suniel_shettys_fitness_and_lifestyle_routine | health]] serves as an inspiration, reminding younger generations that achieving such fitness is possible through simple practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Evolution as an Actor
Initially, after his first film *Balwaan*, he was criticized as "wooden" and advised to return to his Udi restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>. Recognizing he had no formal acting training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a>, he used his "dead defying stunts" to gain a fan following and subsequently learned acting "in the process" of doing more films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:22">[02:48:22]</a>. He views growth as a continuous process, even for individuals in their 50s or 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

### Current Projects and Cultural Relevance
Suniel Shetty acknowledges that the film industry has changed, with social media creating a lack of privacy and allowing for misinterpretations that can damage lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He feels that individuals are often forced to be diplomatic to avoid scrutiny from unknown people online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>. Despite these [[insights_into_bollywood_industry_trends | challenges]], he has managed to remain culturally relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

His recent project, *Hunter*, allowed him to try his hand at action again, in a "smarter, wiser" way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. He expresses gratitude to the production house and distribution platform (Amazon mini TV) for believing in his ability to deliver an intense subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. He also confirmed that *Hera Pheri 3* is in the works, and the promotional shoot instantly brought back the old camaraderie with his co-stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

Suniel Shetty believes his relevance now comes from a place of having experienced lows and highs, enabling him to share valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. He aims for this new phase of his career to benefit "a lot of people along with me who are not as fortunate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>, emphasizing his desire to give back.

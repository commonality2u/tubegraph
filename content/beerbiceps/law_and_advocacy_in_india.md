## Profile of an Advocate: Ji Deepak

Ji Deepak is a highly respected advocate and one of the most requested guests on the podcast, known for his insights into law, [[cultural_and_systemic_challenges_in_indian_governance | Indic religions]], and [[cultural_and_systemic_challenges_in_indian_governance | Indic culture]], particularly Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. He practices as an arguing counsel before the Supreme Court of India and the Delhi High Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

He describes himself as fundamentally a "Gemini" as a lawyer, having two faces: the lawyer face and the non-lawyer face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. While social media creates illusions, he considers himself just "another guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Ji Deepak also trains in Kalaripayattu, a martial art from Kerala, which he finds a "fantastic way to unwind" and helps break the boxes between mental and physical operation, fostering flexibility, stability, balance, self-awareness, and agility, while also serving as a stress buster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

## The Practice of Law

Ji Deepak's legal work is predominantly commercial litigation, making up about 85% of his practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This includes areas such as intellectual property law, competition law, indirect taxation, insolvency, and corporate litigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. He refers to this as the "most forensic aspects of commercial litigation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, emphasizing precision where "every comma makes a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The remaining 15% of his work involves constitutional and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Commercial vs. Constitutional Law

Ji Deepak differentiates between the two:
*   **Constitutional Law**: Operates at a "60,000 ft" level, focusing on human rights and public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It tends to be more "activistic" and talks about "just people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Commercial Litigation**: Deals with "facts, documents, comma, punctuation, correspondence, contracts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, and focuses on "money, reputation, companies, corporations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

He notes that few people excel in both areas, as constitutional law is often seen as distinct from the detailed, forensic nature of commercial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He highlights examples like Nani Palkhivala, originally a tax lawyer, and Harish Salve, a chartered accountant turned commercial and constitutional lawyer, who brought meticulous commercial skills to constitutional practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Role of an Arguing Counsel

An arguing counsel's primary role is to "exclusively argue in court" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. This involves ventilating arguments, acting as the face in court, and translating complex facts into simple, prioritized points for the judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

### Intuition and Strategy in Law

Beyond facts and law, a lawyer's intuitive side is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This includes the "ability to read the room, to read the person, sense the air, to understand which way the wind is blowing" during an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. An arguing counsel needs "quick thinking on your feet" to adapt their approach based on the audience's reception, even if it means abandoning a prepared script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. Ji Deepak finds "arguing in a court of law" when making a challenging argument and persuading a disagreeing audience to be an "irreplaceable" high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

## Law and Public Discourse

Ji Deepak critiques the nature of [[public_perception_and_polarization_in_india | public perception and polarization in India]], particularly regarding political and religious affiliations. He notes that many opinions are "empty" and driven by "angst" rather than data or evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and that "angst within media spreads faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.## Law and Advocacy in India

Beyond facts and law, a lawyer's intuitive side is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This includes the "ability to read the room, to read the person, sense the air, to understand which way the wind is blowing" during an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

Ji Deepak finds "arguing in a court of law" when making a challenging argument and persuading a disagreeing audience to be an "irreplaceable" high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

## Law and Public Discourse

Ji Deepak critiques the nature of [[public_perception_and_polarization_in_india | public perception and polarization in India]], particularly regarding political and religious affiliations. He notes that many opinions are "empty" and driven by "angst" rather than data or evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and that "angst within media spreads faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Critique of Political Discourse

He argues that much of the debate around a government being "Pro or anti" a particular group (e.g., Hindu or Muslim) lacks substance, as people don't ask "what policy" or "what has it done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This is exemplified by the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, where participants, like Farhan Akhtar, allegedly had no understanding of the legislation they opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)

Ji Deepak explains the CAA's provisions:
*   It reduced the residency period required for refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan to apply for Indian citizenship from 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   It aims to facilitate faster citizenship for non-Muslim minorities facing persecution in these countries, where demographics are dwindling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

He asserts that the CAA does not deprive Indian Muslims of their citizenship rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. He justifies the exclusion of Muslims from these countries by citing the Two-Nation Theory, which underpinned the Partition of India on a religious basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. He states that India has no reason to trust Pakistani or Bangladeshi Muslims, given their nations' historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. He also addresses the exclusion of Ahmadis, arguing that they were proponents of Pakistan's creation and continue to "spew venom against Hindus in Pakistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

Despite its passing, the rules for implementing the CAA have not been notified, with six extensions sought from Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This inaction raises questions about the government's resolve and strength, especially in light of other policy rollbacks like the farm protests and the normalization of the Khalistani movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Temple Control and Cultural Heritage

A significant national issue highlighted by Ji Deepak is the state control over Hindu temples in at least 15 Indian states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. This control leads to:
*   Degradation of the cultural ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>.
*   Alienation of real estate and dissipation of liquid resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
*   Organized smuggling of artifacts, often involving police and government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>.

He recounts representing P. Manickavel, a former DIG of the Idol Wing of the Tamil Nadu State Police, who faced state harassment for exposing this racket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. He argues that reducing temples to "religious tourism" instead of places of worship or community support systems undermines their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>. He suggests that temple funds could be used to educate "depressed classes" as an alternative to reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>.

## Future of Law and India

### Political Landscape

Ji Deepak dismisses the idea of [[indias_political_landscape | India's political landscape]] becoming a single-party state like China or even Singapore, citing India's size, numerous options, and inability to curb political opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. He believes that internal differences within political parties, rather than external opposition, are more likely to drive future change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>. He suggests that the [[elections_and_political_strategy_in_india | elections and political strategy in India]] may shift towards a "presidential style election," where people vote for individuals rather than parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

He foresees a potential "naral and gamal" (soft and hard) divide within the BJP, where some prioritize "infrastructure, investment" (naral) and others focus on issues like "illegal migration" and "changing demographic balance" (gamal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. He argues that growth ("vikas") must go hand-in-hand with "civilizational security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, warning against a situation like Europe, which has "first-world infrastructure" but "zero cultural Moorings or civilizational identity" due to hyper-focus on secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

He cites Uttar Pradesh under Yogi Adityanath as an example where Law and Order has improved alongside infrastructure development, a balancing act that is crucial for India's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. He notes that states like Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, culturally rich and resource-rich, have the potential to significantly contribute to India's overall progress if given the right opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

### Importance of Facts and Data

Ji Deepak stresses the importance of relying on data and evidence over "empty opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He states that his own published work, containing data from official sources, has not been factually contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. He criticizes segments of the [[indian_journalism_and_media_representation | Indian journalism and media representation]] and academia ("the left") for feeding "demonization" and "victimization" without proper research or factual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. He suggests that removing the influence of "the left" from the conversation between Hindus and Muslims would lead to a "much more honest conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Demographic Balance**: He believes the "safety of Bharat" lies in "preserving its accommodating character," which will be maintained "only if it remains Hindu majority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. He notes a "clear demographic imbalance" in over 100 out of 775 districts, viewing it as a "game of populational numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Cultural Identity**: He advocates for an "Indian Islam" that accepts the non-native origins of Abrahamic faiths in Bharat and is empathetic to the indigenous faith systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. He emphasizes that the "native Faith system" should not struggle to find "gasps of breath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Youth Engagement**: He proposes inculcating discipline in [[youth_leadership_and_entrepreneurship_in_india | youth leadership and entrepreneurship in India]] by mainstreaming some part of services in the armed forces, similar to an adapted "Agnipath model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Education System**: Calls for a serious revisitation of the education system beyond history, including approaches to science, reason, and [[cultural_and_systemic_challenges_in_indian_governance | Indic logic and reasoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **Brain Drain**: He predicts a significant reduction in the exodus of talent from Bharat, with more Indians returning due to growth opportunities, cultural bonding, family support, and declining standards in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **Branding Economy**: Suggests creating a "brilliant branding economy" and quality control standards for unique products from various states, similar to Champagne or Scotch, to generate income and incentivize local populations to stay in their regions, reducing urban migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. This includes leveraging Geographical Indication (GI) tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   **Environment**: Highlights the government's "big flaw" in addressing environmental issues and water problems across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

Ji Deepak believes that while India has challenges, there is a clear trajectory towards progress if the nation can address its internal divisions, focus on factual discourse, and leverage its unique strengths.

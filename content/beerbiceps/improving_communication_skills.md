Improving communication skills, particularly in spoken English, is a frequently requested topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The approach to improving language skills should be similar to mastering any life skill, focusing on making the process easy and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Ranveer's Perspective on Language Learning

While English has always been his "thinking language," the speaker admits that language is a significant weakness for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. His confidence in front of the camera and clarity of thought often lead people to believe his English is good, despite his vocabulary not being extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He applied simple tricks to improve his spoken Hindi, believing the same methods can be used for English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Five Simple Steps to [[steps_to_speak_english_fluently | Speak English Fluently]]

To improve spoken English, one should focus on enjoyment and consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It's recommended to practice for a minimum of 15 minutes daily, with an hour being a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Step 1: Engage with Enjoyable Content

Instead of immediately watching news or joining classes, the first step is to engage with content you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

*   **Video Content:**
    *   Start with easy video content like cartoons, as the language used is simple and designed for children to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   If cartoons are not appealing, choose any video content you enjoy, such as sports commentary (e.g., Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Harsh Bhogle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Audio Content:** If you prefer listening, engage with radio or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Reading:** For those who learn better by reading, pick up simple English texts, such as a 10th-standard ICSE textbook with short stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The key is to find what works best for you and practice it daily for at least 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Step 2: Observe Sentence Construction

Once consistent practice of Step 1 is established, the next focus is to observe how English sentences are constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This doesn't involve learning new words or expanding vocabulary initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Identify Differences:** Pay attention to how sentences are constructed in the content you're consuming compared to your own thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Mental Notes:** Make a mental note of any differences, recognizing them as potential areas for improvement in your own speaking patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Practice:** When you identify a different sentence structure, practice saying it to yourself multiple times (e.g., 10 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Prioritize:** Understanding how English is spoken through observation should precede focusing on vocabulary expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Step 3: Set Aside Your Ego

Many Indians associate English proficiency with intelligence, leading to judgment of others' English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, such judgment often stems from the critic's own insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

> "Every time someone makes fun of you, they're not making fun of you, they're making fun of them. They're making fun of an insecurity within them. If they make fun of your English, that means they're conscious about their own English. It's a way of boosting their own egos." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

Embrace mistakes as part of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Mistakes help you remember and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The focus should be on becoming your best self, not on what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Step 4: Pursue Clarity of Thought

Often, hesitation in speaking English comes from overthinking, translating from native languages, or worrying about "what people will think" (log kahenge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   **Meditation:** [[studying_for_selfimprovement | Meditation]] is recommended as a powerful tool to clear the mind and ground thought processes, directly improving clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   Ranveer suggests exploring a meditation playlist for further guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Step 5: De-emphasize the Importance of English

In Indian society, English is often unduly associated with intelligence, a legacy of 200 years of British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This mentality is not common globally, where people are proud of their native languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Cultural Pride:** Be proud of your own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **It's Not a Big Deal:** Not speaking English perfectly is not a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Code-Switching:** If you get stuck while speaking English, it's acceptable to complete your sentences in Hindi or your native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This flexibility is becoming more accepted, especially compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

By following these steps, individuals can effectively improve their communication skills and overcome common [[overcoming_language_learning_challenges | language learning challenges]] associated with English.

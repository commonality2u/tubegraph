[[Aashna Shroffs background and family influences|Aashna Shroff]] attributes her current success to her entire family situation, which shaped her into the person she is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. She considers her current life a "dream life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Early Life and Family Influences

Shroff was raised by a single parent, her mother, who was divorced before or shortly after Shroff was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. She grew up living with her maternal grandparents and her mother's *masi* (aunt), as well as her mother's older sister who has Down syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

From a young age, Shroff's life was centered around responsibility due to her mother's role as the sole earner for five other family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Her mother's constant absence due to work meant Shroff was often home with her grandparents, making her aware of the family's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Shroff recalls a particularly difficult period during her college years when her family had only 1,500 rupees in their account with no clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Her mother was instrumental in overcoming this financial hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Motivations Fueling Her Career

Shroff's primary motivation is the happiness of her mother and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. She gives her earnings to her mother to manage the household and wants her mother to enjoy life, including buying luxury items and traveling, experiences her mother never had while raising her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Her career is also driven by her passion for her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. She values patience, hard work, and staying true to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Key Traits and Beliefs

Shroff identifies her stubbornness as a significant strength that has helped her succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. She describes herself as an "executor" who ensures tasks are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. She also strongly believes in manifestation, where positive thinking and energies contribute to achieving goals, alongside diligent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Overcoming Career Challenges

Shroff's journey into fashion blogging began with an online store on Facebook, where she sold imported items from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. She started posting her outfits on Instagram, and positive feedback encouraged her to start a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Initially, blogging was a gamble as it was a nascent field in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Her online store provided a backup while she ventured into blogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Her first paid collaboration, with India Circus, came a year after starting her blog, earning her 5,000 rupees for a blog post and three Instagram posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

[[Overcoming challenges in early career|A significant challenge arose]] about a year and a half into her blog, when it wasn't generating substantial income despite her significant time and effort investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Her mother suggested she close the blog and focus solely on the more profitable online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, Shroff refused, insisting she would make time for both, a decision she is now grateful for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Despite being naturally shy and not very social, Shroff believes that good work speaks for itself, which has allowed her to build her business successfully without relying heavily on personal networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Today, her blog generates between 5 to 10 lakhs a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, and individual brand deals can run into five or six digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. She manages her business by carefully selecting brands she can connect with, planning content and shoots, and delegating financial negotiations to her cousin (her mother's cousin), who serves as her manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. She feels immense gratitude for her current work commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

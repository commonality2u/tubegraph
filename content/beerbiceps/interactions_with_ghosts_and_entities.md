Dr. Savio Fado, a demonologist and psychic, leads paranormal investigations and exorcisms as part of a team including Sarjit Mohanti and Puja Vijay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The team approaches their work with a scientific method, utilizing devices to measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) and conducting thorough research before investigating locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The intention behind their work is to help people understand darkness to move towards light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

The most challenging aspect of their work is proving that a place is genuinely haunted and how their research can contribute to humanity's understanding of the paranormal, which currently resides in a "gray shaded area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Entities and Demons

A "demon" is described as any unwanted sickness within the body, soul, or spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. This extends to physical ailments like flu or leprosy, which ancient peoples might have referred to as demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. Demons are believed to be "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>, similar to invisible bacteria or viruses that exist without being immediately perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>.

While some believe in a hierarchy of demons with Satan at the top, Dr. Fado suggests that demons, like angels, are programmed to perform specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. Every demon has its own weakness, which an exorcist must identify to effectively deal with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:24]</a>.

There are also [[encounters_with_dark_entities | weaker entities]] that can latch onto people, causing misfortunes, accidents, or family discord without the affected person even realizing they are under influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>. These "free radicals of energy" can form demons if they receive a negative spiritual memory, just as positive spiritual memories can form angels or spirit guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

Entities or ghosts typically do not appear "scary" like in movies; they look like normal humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:25:00">[50:25:00]</a>. They may not even realize they are dead, or they might choose not to cross over due to unresolved desires like concern for family, attachment to property, or a desire for revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. These [[experiences_and_beliefs_about_the_occult_and_paranormal | invisible entities]] coexist with humans, and as long as they are not disturbing anyone, they are left undisturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### How Entities Interact and Gain Energy
Entities that lack a physical body do not have organs like eyes or ears, so communication with them is primarily telepathic, relying on vibrations and unspoken thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:35:00">[58:35:00]</a>. They only expend energy to interact with someone who acknowledges their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.

Entities gather energy from various sources like EMF, light, air, water, or even other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. The more energy an entity accumulates, the more powerful it becomes and the more it can manipulate the physical realm, leading to Poltergeist activities like throwing objects or shattering glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.

## [[Understanding Demonic Possession | Demonic Possession]] and Exorcism

[[Understanding Demonic Possession | Demonic possession]] occurs when an individual shows vulnerability, allowing a demon to latch onto their aura if there's a "gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>. Demons feed on negative emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.

An exorcist is someone who can help with a [[Understanding Demonic Possession | demonic possession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. Dr. Fado's first experience with the paranormal was witnessing his elder brother perform a religious exorcism of a friend who was "demonically possessed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. During this event, the frail young man could lift a sofa with one hand, vomited, and used vulgar language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.

### The Exorcism Process
Exorcism goes beyond mental health therapy, working in parallel to psychological and psychiatric treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. The first crucial step is to diagnose and identify the specific demon, as each demon has its own weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. The process is not necessarily dramatic like in movies; it can be calm and relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. It requires a tailored approach, as every person and mental illness is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>. If the possessed person is in a "manic phase," the exorcist waits until they calm down before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>. The goal is to help the person find answers and emancipate their spirit and soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.

Fear is not an option for an exorcist, as demons feed off it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. Dr. Fado maintains a constant meditative state to increase the density of his aura, preventing entities from latching onto him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>. He performs [[spiritual_practices_for_protection_against_negative_entities | spiritual hygiene]] at the location itself to shun off entities and prevent them from following him home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

### Challenging Cases
One of Dr. Fado's most challenging exorcism cases involved two boys, who were half-brothers, acting "manically demonically possessed" in synchronized ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. They would mimic each other's violent actions, such as trying to stab themselves or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>. The connection was revealed to be their father, who was indulging in pedophilia; the boys' manic phases occurred synchronously with his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. The possessions stopped after the father committed suicide, leaving uncertainty as to the true cause of resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.

Another difficult encounter was at a dilapidated temple outside Mumbai, where two entities were fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. The entity outside, a mother seeking revenge for her daughter's rape and murder by the landowner's son, was particularly turbulent and violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. This entity physically restrained Dr. Fado by activating thick branches of trees to block his way, an unusual physical manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. The team cleansed the place through a specific ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.

## [[The Concept of Portals and Haunted Objects | Haunted Objects]] and Portals

Dr. Fado collects [[the_concept_of_portals_and_haunted_objects | charged objects]] from [[the_concept_of_portals_and_haunted_objects | haunted locations]] or private cases, storing them at his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:25:00">[43:25:00]</a>. The most intense object in his collection is a large mirror, which he states "opens a portal" and must be kept covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>.

A [[the_concept_of_portals_and_haunted_objects | portal]] is defined as a doorway or entryway to another world or dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>. Not all mirrors are portals, but they can be, especially when two mirrors face each other, creating an endless loop that can serve as a passage for entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. This concept is also recognized in Vastu and Feng Shui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.

Besides mirrors, natural portals can form where three or four elements interact, such as certain water bodies or trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. Houses can also become portals if objects that emit high EMF, like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, or refrigerators, are placed in a triangular configuration <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>.

## Illusions and Manipulations
Entities can create illusions and manipulate perceptions. Dr. Fado recalled a recent case where he heard two people speaking Marathi and calling out, but no one was there; this was interpreted as the demon's attempt to deter him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Throughout that investigation, the team felt someone was speaking outside, heard a lady screeching, and saw torch lights, all seemingly designed to disrupt their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.

Ouija boards are generally considered to work based on the "otor effect," where unconscious micro-muscle movements of participants move the planchet, drawing information from their subconscious memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>. However, they can also invite entities if there's an intention or openness to manipulation by a demon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. The desire of a dead entity to interact with the living world can make it responsive if a form of communication is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

## The [[Role of Psychic Abilities in Paranormal Work | Role of Psychic Abilities]]

Dr. Fado describes his [[the_role_of_psychic_abilities_in_paranormal_work | psychic abilities]] as developmental, growing from skills like handwriting analysis, face reading, behavior analysis, and body language to hypnotherapy and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. He realized there was "something more" when he could sense the density or history of objects, places, and people by touching surfaces (psychometry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. He aims to eventually translate this ability into technology to solve crimes by "reading" locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

NLP, beyond simple affirmations, involves programming one's own or others' brains for telepathic communication, reading non-verbal cues, and understanding internal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This extended to understanding locations, discerning when a place was "angry" or "calm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. He uses these abilities for "peripheral audit" to determine if a place is truly haunted and worthy of investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Dr. Fado is also consulted by the police to help resolve cases, including one where a police officer's son was killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

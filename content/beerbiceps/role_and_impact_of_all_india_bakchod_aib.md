All India Bakchod (AIB) was once considered the top media company in the Indian internet landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The podcast delves into the startup and business story of AIB, including its eventual disintegration and the aftermath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Founding and Early Days
AIB began in early 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. One of its founders, Tanmay Bhat, began building the company around the age of 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Business Model and Challenges
AIB was not a funded company; it operated by reinvesting whatever money came in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. They even funded a movie called *Chintu*, which was intended for festivals and potential acquisition by an OTT platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Financial Distress
Overnight, following controversies, all brand associations disappeared, plunging AIB into severe debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. By October of the previous year, the company realized it only had funds until November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Projects already shot could not be released, and money had been fronted for a show with Amazon, leading to significant financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Fortunately, those AIB owed money to were largely understanding and trusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Disintegration and Aftermath
One of the "three worst moments" in Tanmay Bhat's life was having to let go of all AIB employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The four founders were in a room with the entire office when he broke down, unable to offer any explanation other than that "this is it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. For a period of one to two months, Tanmay had no office to go to, leading to a profound personal crisis where he questioned his identity outside of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Impact on Employees
Despite the difficult circumstances, AIB proved to be an "institution" for its employees, akin to earning another degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In hindsight, every person who worked at AIB managed to secure a much higher-paying job and are now "killing it," with some even founding new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### One Hand Clap
AIB's social media team, composed of 22-23 year olds, went on to start their own company, One Hand Clap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Tanmay Bhat later invested in their company, which now manages AIB's social media and their own endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This new company even helped AIB repay a portion of its debt, viewing AIB as their "home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Current Status
The founders of AIB remain in touch and are pursuing their individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The movie *Chintu* is still in progress, and a show is coming out on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. While the AIB YouTube channel is currently inactive, other projects are in the works, including a movie from their "First Draft" initiative slated for February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Additionally, Tanmay Bhat is working on two movies presented by AIB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Rohan Joshi and Ashish Shakya have also shot specials for Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from AIB's Journey
Looking back, Tanmay Bhat believes one definitive change he would have made was hiring a CEO solely focused on running the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. As an artist, his judgment was often impaired, and he struggled to prioritize effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. He also realized he was an insecure leader, which manifested in how he managed employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. He now understands that secure individuals make better leaders and that cruelty in management often stems from insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Public Scrutiny and Media Perception
Tanmay Bhat notes that being in the news consistently for five years taught him that news doesn't always reflect the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. News prioritizes views and sensationalism over complicated, nuanced truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. He advises people to use their own judgment, not consume every piece of news, and avoid judging others as purely "black or white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. He observes that those least accepting of others' flaws are often unaware of their own, lacking introspection and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

He attributes the change in internet behavior to features like retweets and comment section buttons, which incentivize seeking likes over genuine reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This leads to quick anger and [[public_perception_and_polarization_in_india | uniform judgment]] of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Controversies
*   **Sachin L. Controversy:** This incident caused significant stress for Tanmay Bhat's parents, who questioned why he continued with comedy, especially after the roast a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **The Roast:** This event, which occurred a year before the Sachin L. controversy, contributed to his parents' distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. During the 50 days of writing for the roast, he consumed excessive amounts of ice cream daily, eating his anxiety away, which led to significant weight gain and health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

This article details methods for [[dandruff removal or dandruff treatment done at home | dandruff removal or dandruff treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For most people, dandruff can be cured by following specific practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Understanding Dandruff

Before delving into treatment, it's important to understand the [[types of dandruff and their characteristics | two kinds of dandruff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Common Dandruff**: Characterized by white flakes falling off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While not inherently harmful, it can be an embarrassing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Seborrheic Dermatitis**: A more severe form where white flakes are accompanied by intense itching in the scalp, hairline, and ear regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This condition can also cause boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### How Dandruff Forms
Dandruff primarily forms due to the scalp being a highly active environment, constantly producing and shedding skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If the scalp is also very oily, these dead skin cells can collect, mix with oil, and form the white flakes associated with dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Dandruff can be caused by either too little or too much oiling, shampooing, or conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Dandruff Treatment at Home: Four Secrets

### Secret Number 1: Correcting Hair Care Mistakes
Proper [[mens hair care routine | hair care]] is crucial for preventing dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **Oiling**: Oil acts as "fertilizer" for your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Oil your hair at least two to three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   Avoid oiling more than three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   An excessively dry scalp can contribute to dead skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Shampooing**:
    *   Shampoo your hair twice or thrice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   If experiencing dandruff, use [[using antidandruff and mild shampoos | anti-dandruff shampoo]] once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Avoid shampooing daily, as it removes the hair's natural protective layer of oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Conditioning**: Conditioners are oil-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Condition every time you use a mild shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   Do not overdo or underdo conditioning, as too much can make the scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Hair Product Usage**:
    *   Excessive [[hair care routine to prevent dandruff | hair product]] usage (waxes, gels, clays, serums, creams) can cause dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Ensure hair products are applied only to the body of the hair, not the scalp, as contact with the scalp can worsen dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Secret Number 2: Caring for Your Environment
Dandruff is an infection, so a clean environment is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

*   **Pillowcases**: Clean pillowcases by dipping them in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This helps eliminate dandruff infestation from the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes**: Regularly clean combs and brushes using the same antiseptic method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear**: Clean all headgear, including caps, hats, and helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hair Accessories**: Wash any hair bands or hair clips that come into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Secret Number 3: Understanding Home Remedies and Skin pH
The skin's natural pH is 5.5, meaning it is slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This acidity helps kill harmful bacteria and infections, acting as a protective layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In individuals with dandruff, the scalp's pH may be imbalanced, becoming less acidic than it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many [[using antidandruff and mild shampoos | anti-dandruff products]] work by rebalancing this pH, making the scalp more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Natural products that are slightly acidic can help cure dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Examples include:

*   Kurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar**: For best results, use organic apple cider vinegar that specifies "with the mother" on the packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   Mix the apple cider vinegar with a little water to create a slightly dilute solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Apply this solution to your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It cleanses the scalp and works similarly to curd or lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Secret Number 4: Choosing Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos
While home remedies can be effective, [[benefits of organic antidandruff products | organic anti-dandruff shampoos]] are often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. If you have dandruff, it is essential to use an [[using antidandruff and mild shampoos | anti-dandruff shampoo]] at least once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Many conventional anti-dandruff shampoos contain sulfates, parabens, and other harmful chemicals that can damage hair quality in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Organic options like WOW Apple Cider Shampoos are sulfate and paraben-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These products help rebalance the scalp's pH to cure dandruff while also maintaining hair quality long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

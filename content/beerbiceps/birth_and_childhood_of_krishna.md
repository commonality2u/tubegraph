The story of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] is primarily found in the *Bhagavata Purana*, also known as *Srimad Bhagavatam* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. This text is considered the body of [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]] himself, with its 12 chapters (Skandhas) corresponding to the 12 syllables of the Vasudeva Mantram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. The heart of the *Bhagavatam* is found in its seventh chapter, dedicated to the devotee Prahlada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. The story of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] specifically begins in the 10th chapter, which corresponds to the face of the Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

## The Prophecy and Birth

[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s birth is celebrated during [[the_life_of_krishna | Janmashtami]], which falls on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark half (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Shravana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:07">[07:24:07]</a>. This night is known as Moharatri, the "night of delusion," signifying the extraordinary and magical nature of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:24">[10:51:24]</a>.

The story begins with Devaki and Vasudeva's marriage. Devaki's cousin, Kamsa, was very fond of her and arranged a lavish wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:07">[12:56:07]</a>. After the ceremony, as Kamsa was taking them for a procession, a celestial voice (Akashavani) prophesied that Devaki's eighth child would be responsible for Kamsa's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:07">[13:10:07]</a>. Kamsa immediately intended to kill Devaki, but Vasudeva implored him, promising to hand over all their children, especially the eighth, to spare Devaki's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:06">[13:22:06]</a>. Kamsa then imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:07">[13:40:07]</a>.

Initially, Kamsa was only interested in the eighth child. However, the sage Narada intervened, suggesting that the eighth child's threat might be linked to the preceding seven, prompting Kamsa to kill all of Devaki's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:07">[14:15:07]</a>. This act, though gruesome, served a divine purpose: it forced Kamsa to constantly think of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] (his "killer"), turning him into a "fear yogi" (Bhaya Yogi) who ultimately attained deliverance by being obsessed with the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:07">[14:41:07]</a>.

On the night of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s birth, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] appeared in his divine form (Swarupam) as [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]] with Shankha, Chakra, Gad, and Padma, revealing himself to Devaki and Vasudeva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:31">[17:22:31]</a>. He then transformed back into a baby boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:07">[17:34:07]</a> and instructed Vasudeva to take him across the Yamuna River to Gokul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:07">[17:39:07]</a>.

## Transfer to Gokul and Early Years

Vasudeva, guided by [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s instructions, carried the infant [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] in a basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:07">[28:57:07]</a>. It was monsoon season, and the Yamuna River was in full spate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:07">[29:31:07]</a>. Adishesha, the multi-headed serpent, appeared to shield the baby from the rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:07">[29:37:07]</a>. The river, yearning to touch [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s feet, swelled but then parted and subsided as soon as a droplet of water touched his feet, allowing Vasudeva to cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:07">[29:51:07]</a>.

In Gokul, Nanda and Yashoda, the chieftain and his wife, had given birth to a baby girl. Unknown to them, this girl was Yoga Maya, [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]]'s sister and Shakti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:07">[31:31:07]</a>. The story reveals that [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]] (from Vaikuntham) came to Vasudeva and Devaki, while [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] (from Goloka) came as a beam of light to Nanda and Yashoda, merging to form the [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] Avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:07">[31:51:07]</a>.

Vasudeva swapped the babies, bringing Yoga Maya back to the jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:07">[30:28:07]</a>. As soon as he returned, the quietness disappeared; the chains binding him fell, and the guards awoke, alerted by the baby girl's cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:07">[34:07:07]</a>. Kamsa was informed and tried to kill the baby girl by smashing her head on a stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:07">[34:40:07]</a>. However, she slipped from his hands, ascended into the sky, and declared that his killer was safe on the other side of the Yamuna, further instilling "fear yoga" in Kamsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:07">[34:46:07]</a>. This Yoga Maya eventually becomes Subhadra in later stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:07">[37:57:07]</a>.

[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s elder brother, Balarama, was also born in a miraculous way. He was the seventh child of Devaki, but Yoga Maya, on [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]]'s instruction, carefully pulled him from Devaki's womb and placed him in the womb of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva, who was residing safely in Gokul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:07">[42:07:07]</a>. The name "Sankaran" (another name for Balarama) means "one who is pulled out carefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:07">[43:47:07]</a>.

## Madura Leelas in Vrindavan

[[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s childhood and teenage years in Vrindavan and Gokul are filled with what are called "Madura Leelas" (sweet divine plays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:09:07">[53:09:07]</a>. These stories often involve elements of nature, reflecting [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s connection to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:07">[52:49:07]</a>. He is associated with cows, birds, animals, and peacocks, often grazing cows in groves and forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:07">[50:51:07]</a>.

One significant Madura Leela is the subduing of the five-headed snake Kalia (or Kalinga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:07">[54:26:07]</a>. When [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] and his friends were playing, their ball fell into the Yamuna, where Kalia lived, terrorizing the inhabitants. [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] bravely jumped from a Kadamba tree into the water, submerged for some time, and emerged dancing on Kalia's heads, subduing the snake and driving it away from Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:07">[54:30:07]</a>.

The most famous of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s Madura Leelas is the [[the_life_of_krishna | Rasalila]]. This is not a "lustful dance" but a profound spiritual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. "Rasa" means "essence," and the Rasalila represents dissolving into the bliss of the divine experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. It is described in five chapters of the *Dasham Skandham* of the *Bhagavatam*, representing the five *pranas* (life forces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

The [[the_life_of_krishna | Rasalila]] begins when [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]], playing his flute, calls the Gopis (cowherd women) to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. The Gopis are not merely Milkmen or cowherds; "Go" refers to our sense organs, and "Pa" refers to *Piti* (to drink). Gopis are those who "drink the essence of Paramatma with all their sense organs," singularly focused on [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. When [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] calls, they abandon everything to follow him, demonstrating true devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. During the [[the_life_of_krishna | Rasalila]], [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] manifests a personal [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] for every Gopi, dancing with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. This divine dance is also understood as a representation of the Sri Chakram, where one central [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] expands into layers of [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]s, symbolizing the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.

## Transition to Adulthood and Mahabharata

After his Madura Leelas, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] leaves Vrindavan to fulfill his duty of slaying Kamsa in Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>. His departure causes immense sadness among the Gopis, marking a significant and emotional transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. In Mathura, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]] defeats Kamsa and re-establishes Kamsa's father, Ugrasena, as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

From this point, [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s actions are referred to as "Aishwarya Leelas," where he openly displays his divine power and acts as Parabrahma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>. This phase connects [[the_life_of_krishna | Krishna]]'s story in the *Bhagavatam* with the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]], where he becomes a mentor, counsel, and strategist for the Pandavas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:55">[01:41:55]</a>. His most significant Aishwarya Leela during this time is the delivery of the [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavad Gita]] on the battlefield of Kurukshetra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>.

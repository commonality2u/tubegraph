Tanmay Bhat's Journey: From Comedy Kingpin to Personal Reinvention
[[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay Bhat]], a prominent figure in the Indian media industry, has undergone significant personal and professional transformations, navigating through the highs of success with AIB and the lows of public scrutiny and personal challenges. His journey highlights resilience, the redefinition of success, and the pursuit of internal well-being.

### Early Beginnings and Mentorship
The podcast host credits [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay Bhat]] as his first mentor in the media industry. This relationship began when the host, then a personal coaching client of [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay's]], helped him with his [[tanmays_weight_loss_journey_and_fitness | weight loss journey]] in exchange for mentorship on navigating the YouTube landscape [00:00:00]. During this time, AIB (All India Bakchod) was considered the top media company in the Indian internet space [00:00:23].

### The AIB Story: Rise, Disintegration, and Debt
The episode delves into the startup and business story of AIB, including its eventual disintegration [00:00:31]. [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] describes how AIB faced significant financial challenges, entering severe debt after brands disappeared overnight. As an unfunded company, AIB relied on reinvesting its earnings. Projects like the movie *Chintu* were put on hold, and production costs piled up, leading to substantial outstanding payments to people [00:14:14].

One of the "three worst moments" in [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay's]] life was the difficult decision to let all AIB employees go [00:11:47]. This moment caused him to break down and cry in front of everyone, as there was no other explanation for the company's situation [00:11:57]. Despite the hardship, he later found solace in seeing former AIB employees thrive, securing higher-paying jobs, founding new companies, and living fulfilling lives [00:12:13]. He notes that the AIB social media team even started their own company, One Hand Clap, and helped AIB repay a portion of its debt [00:13:37].

### Personal Struggles and Rock Bottom
The period following AIB's challenges marked a "darkest" yet "enlightening" phase for [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay Bhat]] [00:17:37]. For one to two months, he had no office or purpose, spending his days eating and sleeping, questioning his identity beyond his work [00:17:00]. This experience led to a profound personal reinvention [00:17:48], helping him realize he was a person even without an office to go to [00:17:20].

He was diagnosed with clinical depression in December following these events [00:27:52]. To cope, he moved to Bangalore, seeking an environment outside the media world [00:27:55]. There, he surrounded himself with entrepreneurs from different domains, consulting for companies and exploring tech ideas [00:28:33]. This shift helped him turn sadness into fuel for growth and discover that his strengths aligned with the startup world [00:28:17].

#### Near-Death Experience
Adding to his challenges, [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] recounts a phase where he "almost died" due to acute sleep apnea [00:48:51]. At his heaviest weight of 245 kilos [00:49:00], lack of oxygen to his brain during sleep caused seizures. During a medical check-up, his neck muscles collapsed, leading to a temporary cessation of breathing. He was resuscitated and spent six days in the ICU [00:49:26]. This incident, which occurred two days after a major "roast" show where he had consumed excessive ice cream and eaten his anxiety away, served as a turning point for him to get his health in order [00:49:59].

### Redefining Success and Self-Worth
[[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] reflects deeply on the societal definition of success, often equated solely with career achievements and financial gain [00:05:13]. He questions why success isn't measured by happiness, good friendships, or being a loyal family member [00:05:29]. He believes this societal metric is something people often forget to question [00:05:51].

He acknowledges that his own self-worth was too tied to his work and productivity, a mistake he feared repeating [00:04:50]. This drive, or "hustle," stemmed from a void, a need to fill something by sacrificing everything else [00:08:15]. He argues that hustle isn't necessarily a good thing in itself, but it's important at certain stages of life, like in one's mid-20s, when people are intensely focused on work [00:08:01].

[[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] now believes that the meaning of life is whatever one wants it to be [00:08:38]. He advocates for creating goals that help one achieve "flow" – a state where challenge and skill are perfectly matched [00:09:09].

### Views on Media, Public Perception, and Leadership
Having been consistently in the news for five years, [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] asserts that "everything you read in the news [is] not necessarily the truth" [00:18:35]. He explains that news prioritizes views over truth, which is often complex and nuanced [00:18:47]. He advises people to stop using news as absolute truth and to use their own judgment, recognizing that everyone is "gray" rather than black or white [00:19:33]. He laments that social media's incentive system encourages reactions for likes rather than genuine engagement [00:20:01].

As a leader, [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay]] admits to being insecure, which manifested in ways that impacted his employees [00:22:42]. He learned that truly great leaders are secure in themselves and focus on bringing out the best in others, rather than compensating for their own insecurities by putting employees down [00:23:10]. He now aims to empower young talent, recognizing that they won't work with him forever but should be encouraged to pursue their own ventures [00:38:30]. He values "lazy geniuses" – individuals with great ideas who find the most efficient ways to achieve them [00:39:02].

### Current Focus and Future Outlook
Currently, [[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay's]] main priority is creative flow, including finishing a movie he's been writing [00:43:47]. He is also exploring opportunities in the tech startup world, appreciating Bangalore's "wealth games" culture of collaboration over Bombay's "status games" [00:30:00]. He has embraced gaming as a content hack, allowing him to produce daily videos while showcasing his fun personality [00:39:25].

He describes himself as "immensely happy" now, having rediscovered enthusiasm for life after hitting rock bottom [00:04:25]. He acknowledges a shift from being cynical to more positive, realizing that positivity is crucial for overcoming bad situations [00:26:40].

### Lessons on Health and Body Image
[[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay's]] [[tanmays_weight_loss_journey_and_fitness | weight loss journey]] is ongoing, with a focus on sustainable, long-term change rather than quick sprints [00:41:52]. He has lost 8 kilos in 2.5 months and aims for a steady 4 kilos a month through diet and regular activity like walking and badminton [00:41:30]. He views losing weight as equally a painful mental exercise as it is physical [00:58:53].

He delves into the psychological aspects of obesity and body shaming, emphasizing the unaddressed trauma many overweight children experience [00:56:50]. He advises young people facing bullying to allow themselves to cry and process their emotions, as men often lack the skills to vent [00:57:38]. He recognizes that his own desire to remain overweight stemmed from a subconscious belief that he didn't deserve happiness due to childhood bullying [00:59:19]. He now understands that changes in physical health profoundly impact one's thought process and confidence [00:58:28].

### Final Message
[[Tanmays weight loss journey and fitness | Tanmay Bhat's]] overarching message from his life experiences is about patience and playing "long-term games" [01:05:05]. He stresses that life is long and there's no need to rush, encouraging people to take their time and make games out of life, enjoying the process [01:05:13].

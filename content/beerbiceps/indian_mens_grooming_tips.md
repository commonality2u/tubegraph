For the average young Indian man, male grooming is essential to looking handsome, clean, and tidy [00:00:04]. The focus is on basic, everyday practices rather than fancy products or techniques [00:00:30]. Looking attractive, especially to the average Indian woman, comes down to appearing neat and clean [00:00:50]. These tips address common issues faced by Indian men, such as acne, oily skin, scruffy hair, and high humidity [00:00:14].

## Top Seven Easy Grooming Points

### 1. Haircuts
[[importance_of_haircuts_and_styles | Haircuts]] are crucial as they significantly affect your face structure and overall tidiness [00:00:58]. For many Indian men with rough hair, growing it out is not advisable unless it's silky smooth [00:01:05].

A recommended "golden haircut" for a neat and classy look involves a slightly long top and slightly short sides [00:01:17]. This style is common among well-groomed athletes like Virat Kohli, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Olivier Giroud, with variations in ratios for different face structures [00:01:24]. The most important rule is to maintain a neat and tidy appearance, as women associate cleanliness with looking good [00:01:52].

### 2. Facial Hair Grooming
[[facial_hair_grooming_and_shaving_tips | Getting your facial hair game correct]] is vital, as many young men make mistakes in this area [00:02:06]. There are three main approaches:
*   **Growing a Full Beard:** This requires dedicated beard grooming [00:02:12].
*   **Stylizing Your Beard:** Options like a goatee or soul patch can work [00:02:21].
*   **Clean Shaven:** This is considered the "golden" and evergreen approach, as nothing says "clean and tidy" like being clean shaven [00:02:42].

#### Shaving Tips
A good quality razor is crucial for shaving [00:02:57]. Key features to look for in a razor include:
*   **Strong and Durable Blades:** This reduces the frequency of replacements, saving money [00:03:12].
*   **Excellent Grip:** A good grip prevents cuts, especially when shaving quickly [00:03:20].
*   **Spring-Mounted Blades:** This allows for precision shaves, which is beneficial for stylizing or navigating around pimples [00:03:27].

### 3. Secondary Facial Hair
Beyond primary facial hair (mustache, beard), attention should be paid to secondary areas that people notice [00:03:50].
*   **Ear Hair:** Many Indians experience hair growing out of their ears, which can be easily shaved off with a regular razor [00:04:04].
*   **Nose Hair:** Trim nose hair using super narrow, sharp small scissors [00:04:11].
*   **Unibrow:** Owning a pair of tweezers is recommended for every guy, regardless of gender stereotypes [00:04:21]. A unibrow can negatively impact one's handsome appearance [00:04:43]. When tweezing, use a sharp pair (where the ends match exactly when joined) [00:04:51]. Focus on plucking only the super thick hairs in the middle, leaving a few strands to maintain a natural look and ensure two distinct eyebrows [00:05:05].

### 4. Basic Face Cleanliness
Basic face cleanliness is essential to prevent an oily, sleepy appearance [00:05:28].
*   **Face Wash:** Use a basic, mild face wash twice daily [00:05:46]. This helps remove excess oil, which contributes to pimples [00:05:59].
*   **Routine:** Wash your face in the morning after waking up and at night one to two hours before bedtime [00:06:16]. This routine is particularly beneficial for young men in their teens or early twenties, especially those who frequent the gym, as they are more prone to [[grooming_tips_for_different_skin_types | acne]] [00:06:06].
*   **Application:** Rub the face wash deep into your skin and rinse with tepid (room temperature) water [00:06:34]. This process removes excess oil and sebum, leading to a much cleaner look [00:06:54].

### 5. Bonus Skincare Routine
For occasions like important meetings or parties, an occasional bonus [[grooming_tips_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] can enhance neatness [00:07:08].
*   **Moisturizer:** Apply a basic moisturizer to rehydrate your skin [00:07:40]. Daily use of moisturizer is not recommended for oily skin, as it can block pores and cause more acne [00:07:17].
*   **Baby Powder:** Use baby powder instead of regular talcum powder [00:07:48]. Baby powder has very fine granules that are less likely to block pores [00:07:50]. While excessive use can be detrimental, a small amount can help control oily skin for special events [00:07:57]. If too much is applied, wipe it down with a slightly wet cloth [00:08:26]. This routine is considered the closest thing to makeup for men, offering a subtle difference in appearance [00:08:32].

### 6. Hand and Nail Grooming
Beyond facial appearance, women also gauge cleanliness by looking at hands [00:09:03].
*   **Nail Hygiene:** Keep your nails short and remove dirt from underneath them [00:09:21]. These small details are crucial for a long-term handsome appearance and conveying cleanliness [00:09:24].
*   **Calluses:** If you have calluses from activities like gym workouts, which some women might find unattractive, apply a little moisturizer to soften them [00:09:44].

### 7. Fragrances
Fragrances are vital as women associate you with the way you smell [00:10:11]. For first encounters and impressions, wearing perfume is highly recommended [00:10:21].

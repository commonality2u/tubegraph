Actor Sanjay Dutt describes his life as a "roller coaster ride" filled with various challenges, including drug addiction, jail time, and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He emphasizes that he does not regret these dark periods, as he has learned from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. For Dutt, the core battle is [[handling_stress_and_overcoming_failure | how to face difficulties and get out of them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The Cancer Diagnosis

Dutt recounts the onset of his cancer during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. He experienced extreme breathlessness after walking up steps and even after taking a bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. An X-ray revealed that his lungs were more than half covered in water, which had to be drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. While doctors initially hoped it was tuberculosis (TB), it was confirmed to be cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

The challenge was then how to break the news to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. His sister eventually informed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

## Emotional and Mental Battle

Upon receiving the diagnosis, Dutt admits he cried for two to three days, thinking about his children, wife, and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. These moments were characterized by flashes of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. However, he quickly decided to stop feeling weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

## Treatment and Recovery Approach

Dutt began chemotherapy, recommended by Dr. Santi, whom he describes as a brilliant doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. His approach to recovery was to challenge the disease head-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>:
*   After every chemotherapy session, he would immediately get on a bike and cycle for an hour daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   He would go to Dubai for chemo and then play badminton for two to three hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

This disciplined approach helped him regain his strength, muscle, and "old self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. He vows not to let himself go again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

## Call for a Cancer Cure

Dutt expresses a strong wish that cancer did not exist, not just for himself but for all who suffer, especially those who cannot afford treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. He believes that pharmaceutical companies possess a cure but withhold its release for financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. He appeals to them to release the cure to save lives, prioritizing health over money and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

Therapy, as understood from a neuroscience perspective, can be seen as "outsourcing one role of the brain to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This role primarily involves "creating a story" that helps an individual make sense of their experiences and deal with circumstances effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Therapy as "Software" Management
Therapists and psychologists often approach mental health from a "software perspective," focusing on how the human mind functions and how an individual perceives the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. While they possess knowledge of the brain's "hardware," their primary role is to guide individuals through the "software" of their thoughts and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Why Therapy is Needed
In [[meditation_and_mental_health | mental health problems]], the brain may struggle to process information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Therapy intervenes by helping individuals "see the world differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The core function of therapy is to assist the brain in performing its job of "constantly creating a story to make yourself feel good" and "empower you to deal with those circumstances," especially when the brain cannot do so on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

A key aspect of therapy involves "being asked the right questions and realizing things from within yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. People often "lie to ourselves" to maintain balance in life, much like a surfer constantly adjusting their balance to avoid falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. When these "small lies or small biases" fail, and one begins to "fall" or "lose confidence," therapy helps teach "how to maintain balance" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Changing Perceptions of Therapy
Historically, [[meditation_and_mental_health | mental health]] was a taboo subject, and topics like teenage anxiety were often dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The current generation (Gen Z) has fostered greater awareness about [[meditation_and_mental_health | mental health]], leading to more open conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, this shift has also resulted in an extreme where "everything is mental health," potentially diluting the understanding of genuine mental health issues and the [[importance_of_developing_mental_fitness_and_resilience | importance of mental fitness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in finding a "nuance" and "middle ground" between focusing solely on emotional empathy (software) and the physical discipline (hardware) required for overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. While society has evolved to afford the luxury of empathy, discipline remains crucial for functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Therapy, Lifestyle, and Mental Fitness
While therapy addresses the "software" aspect of the mind, it's also important to consider the "hardware" requirements for optimal [[meditation_and_mental_health | mental health]], such as sleep, diet, and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_mental_health_and_productivity | lifestyle factors]] contribute to [[importance_of_developing_mental_fitness_and_resilience | mental fitness]], enabling an individual to better handle life's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For instance, [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditation]] is considered a "hardware polishing tool" that contributes to overall [[importance_of_developing_mental_fitness_and_resilience | mental fitness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The ability to "see the world differently" through therapy, coupled with the cultivation of [[importance_of_developing_mental_fitness_and_resilience | mental fitness]] through lifestyle choices, allows individuals to build resilience and navigate life's inevitable "disappointment," "breakups," and "punch downs" more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

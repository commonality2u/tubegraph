This article details the personal [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings]] of the speaker, delving into a lifelong [[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits]] and the role of spirituality in confronting perceived supernatural phenomena.

## Early Life and Persistent Fear
From a young age, the speaker questioned if there was a deeper layer to reality beyond human presence, a curiosity fueled by horror movies [00:00:26]. Growing up in a house with a family-owned hospital on the ground floor and living on the third floor, the speaker always felt a sense of unease [00:00:42]. A persistent fear of the dark plagued them, with feelings of being stared at in dark corridors or rooms [00:01:00]. This intense fear meant they couldn't sleep alone until the age of 19 or 20 [00:01:21].

## Terrifying [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | Sleep Paralysis Experiences]]
At age 11, the speaker began to frequently experience [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | sleep paralysis]] [00:01:26]. This scientific phenomenon occurs when a person half-wakes up during sleep, with their brain signaling the muscular system not to move as a protective mechanism [00:01:53]. In severe cases, nightmares can blend with reality, leading to frightening hallucinations [00:02:42].

The speaker's [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | sleep paralysis]] often involved waking up to a shadowy figure in their room, unable to scream or react, with the only escape being to close their eyes and hope to fall back asleep [00:03:08].

### The Scariest Incident
One particular [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | sleep paralysis experience]] was especially terrifying [00:03:02]:
*   While sleeping next to their mother, the speaker felt "shadowy creatures" chaining them down to the bed [00:03:41].
*   These creatures screamed, welcoming a "lady" or "queen" [00:04:01].
*   A woman with pale, "achy," torn skin, blisters, and untidy hair appeared, sitting on top of the speaker [00:04:16].
*   She had one pale red eye staring down, with the other eye covered by her hair [00:04:35].
*   The speaker could feel her weight and fingers, unable to move or scream, despite their mother sleeping nearby [00:04:45].
*   Having been taught a mantra for warding off bad spirits by their spiritual mother, the speaker closed their eyes and began chanting "Om Namah Shivaya" [00:05:20].
*   They continued chanting until they fell asleep, still feeling the weight [00:05:51]. Upon opening their eyes later, the figure was gone [00:06:01].

## Post-Experience Discoveries
Two years later, at age 13, the speaker watched a National Geographic show about alien abductions [00:06:16]. The show featured a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon where [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | sleep paralysis]] is accompanied by a witch sitting on top of the person [00:06:37]. The visual representation in the show was "exactly" what the speaker had seen: the same woman, single staring eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, and untidy clothes, with "pale dead eyes" [00:07:20]. This revelation deeply disturbed the speaker, leading them to cry and struggle with sleeping alone for the next 7 to 8 years [00:07:54].

## Overcoming Fear Through Spirituality
The speaker eventually overcame this phobia by embracing spirituality [00:08:21]. Spirituality, while covering meditation and karma, also addresses the [[Paranormal activities and supernatural entities | spirit world]], astral world, dark energies, and demons, offering ways to tackle these energies [00:08:34]. The philosophy "when you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist" from *Autobiography of a Yogi* became central to their approach [00:08:46].

### Meditation in the Haunted Building
The speaker worked on strengthening their "spiritual muscle of [their] mind" through extensive meditation, particularly from the age of 22 or 23 [00:09:00]. While meditating with co-founder Rajas in a garage within their building, the speaker experienced a "dark" meditation session, feeling a negative energy [00:09:15]. Recalling the wisdom of facing fear, they continued meditating and chanted the "Om Namah Shivaya" mantra [00:10:11]. Both the speaker and Rajas felt they successfully pushed out a negative energy from the room and the building [00:10:28].

## Confirmation of a Presence
A friend of the speaker, considered psychic, visited their office [00:10:55]. Without being told, the psychic immediately went to a specific room at the end of the corridor, stating it had a lot of "dark energy" and had been home to "some kind of a demon or a ghost" [00:11:11]. The psychic suggested that their meditation practices had likely pushed it out, making the environment more positive [00:11:42].

The speaker then consulted their grandfather, who owned the building and had run a hospital there since the 1960s [00:12:01]. The grandfather confirmed that patients over a 50-year span had reported similar [[haunted_objects and locations | experiences]]:
*   Feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night [00:12:22].
*   Some patients recovering from routine surgeries even reported a woman pushing them off their hospital beds [00:12:34].
*   They would see a flash of a "really scary looking woman" before she disappeared [00:12:47].

These [[Paranormal activities and supernatural entities | paranormal activities and supernatural entities]] occurred directly beneath the speaker's childhood room where the [[sleep_paralysis_experiences | sleep paralysis]] incident occurred [00:12:53].

## Embracing Spirituality
The hospital is now defunct, and since the psychic's examination, the family has performed pujas, Havens, and lit candles to make the environment more positive, resulting in the negative presence no longer being felt [00:13:00]. The speaker attributes their strong embrace of spirituality to these lifelong [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | experiences]], explaining that their fear of the dark was not just a lack of light but a fear of an entity that stared at them [00:13:41]. By facing this fear and using spiritual practices to cultivate positivity, they learned to push out the darkness [00:14:00]. The speaker's fascination with the [[occult_experiences and belief in ghosts | occult]] stems from these personal [[occult_experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences and belief in ghosts]], emphasizing that spiritual practices can help combat such phenomena [00:14:14].

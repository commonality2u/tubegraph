From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Historian Vikram Sampath emphasizes that the understanding of Indian history, particularly the Freedom Movement, is incomplete and often misrepresented in traditional textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. He holds a PhD in history and has authored books on the Indian Freedom Movement and [[reevaluation_of_historical_figures_like_v_d_savarkar_and_nathuram_godse | V. D. Savarkar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Historical Narratives

Sampath argues that the current education system teaches a "wrong" and "irrelevant" history, focusing on topics that "don't matter in the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He notes a "constant grouse" among young people that they have been "fed the wrong facts," not told the truth, and that history has been excessively "Delhi Centric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This Delhi-centric approach means large parts of India, including mighty dynasties like the Cholas, Vijayanagara Empire, Shahis, Rashtrakutas, Palas, Kadambas, Gangas, Chalukyas, Vodiyars, and Ahoms (who ruled for 600 years), are not featured in textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

He asserts that Indians have been told they are a "nation of losers," with stories of valor and courage from ancestors largely absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The official narrative presents a "linear, simplistic, monochromatic view" of the Freedom Movement, primarily focusing on the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Sampath points out that terms coined by colonial masters are still used in Indian textbooks. For example, Delhi University textbooks and UPSC books call Bhagat Singh, Batukeshwar Dutt, and Jatindas "revolutionary terrorists," a term that was protested by Bhagat Singh's descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Unveiling Hidden History

Sampath advocates for unveiling hidden aspects of the [[role_of_alternate_narratives_in_the_indian_freedom_struggle | Indian Freedom Struggle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Armed Resistance and Revolutionaries
He highlights that alongside the non-violent movement, there was an "unending chain" of "violent armed resistance" from 1857 until 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **1857 Uprising**: The British called the 1857 Uprising the "sepoy mutiny" to disparage it, but [[reevaluation_of_historical_figures_like_v_d_savarkar_and_nathuram_godse | V.D. Savarkar]] famously called it the "first war of Indian independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Naval Mutiny of 1946**: This event, which started in Bombay (Mumbai) and spread to other parts of India like Karachi and Jabalpur, is largely ignored in history textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Sailors initially protested against their ratings and conditions, then their demands grew to include liberation, carrying placards of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. The trials of the Indian National Army (INA) in the Red Fort also created sympathy for the soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Clement Attlee's Revelation**: Clement Attlee, Britain's Prime Minister at the time of India's independence, reportedly told Justice Phanibhusan Chakraborti in the 1950s that the primary reasons for Britain leaving India were the heroics of the INA and the naval mutiny, which terrified the British of a repeat of the 1857 uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He reportedly described the impact of Gandhi's non-violent movement as "minimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Strategy**: Revolutionaries aimed to create insurrections within the British Indian Army, which was predominantly Indian (2.5 million soldiers with only about 10,000 British) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. They believed that seducing even 10% of this force to patriotism would collapse the Raj's edifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.
*   **Impact of Violence**: Sampath argues that British reforms and eventual granting of freedom were often preceded by "bloody revolutionary incidents," like the Morley-Minto Reforms, Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, and the Government of India Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.

## Suppression of Alternate Viewpoints

Sampath contends that after Independence, the political dispensation in power (referring to the Nehruvian government) sought to highlight a specific viewpoint of the freedom struggle, ensuring that anyone not part of the "mainstream of the non-violent movement" did not receive their due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

*   **Political Interference**: Historians like RC Majumdar were removed from projects for intending to be critical of figures like Gandhi, leading other historians to "tow the line" to secure patronage and awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Dissent**: He cites instances like Majrooh Sultanpuri being jailed for a poem criticizing Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>, and Pandit Hridaynath Mangeshkar losing his job at All India Radio in the 1960s for setting [[reevaluation_of_historical_figures_like_v_d_savarkar_and_nathuram_godse | V.D. Savarkar's]] poetry to music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
*   **Collaborators in Power**: Sampath suggests that many who gained power after independence, including bureaucrats and intellectuals, were part of a "larger collaborat[ing] gang" during the British Raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>. He gives the example of Yashpal, described as a British mole who betrayed revolutionaries, yet became a celebrated intellectual and award-winning author after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.

## Re-evaluating Historical Figures

Sampath advocates for the re-evaluation of historical figures, especially those whose narratives have been suppressed or demonized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

### [[reevaluation_of_historical_figures_like_v_d_savarkar_and_nathuram_godse | V.D. Savarkar]]
Sampath highlights Savarkar's significant, yet often overlooked, contributions:
*   **Early Revolutionary**: He started India's first organized secret society, Abhinav Bharat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Protests**: In 1905, he led the first student bonfire of foreign clothes, predating Gandhi's similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.
*   **Influence through Writing**: His book on the 1857 Uprising, calling it the "First War of Indian Independence," became a "Bhagavad Gita" for future revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Rash Behari Bose, and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>.
*   **Imprisonment and Sacrifice**: Savarkar endured 14 years of imprisonment (12 in Kalapani, 2 in Indian mainland jails) and 13 years under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. His degrees were stripped, and his family property confiscated, forcing his wife and sister-in-law to beg for livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

#### Controversy: Mercy Petitions
Sampath addresses the argument that Savarkar wrote "mercy petitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. He clarifies that these were common applications by political prisoners, not exclusive to Savarkar, and contained no apologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>. British records themselves indicate Savarkar showed "no regret or repentance or remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. Furthermore, many petitions were filed on behalf of other younger revolutionaries who lacked English or legal knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

#### Kalapani (Cellular Jail)
Sampath describes Kalapani as one of the "most horrific aspects of our history" and an "Indian Bastille" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Only revolutionaries, not Congress members, were sent there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. Prisoners faced inhumane conditions:
*   Lack of basic rights (food, water, sanitation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   Tortures like "standing handcuffs" for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   Food often contained "pieces of reptiles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.
*   The "kohlua bell punishment," where prisoners were yoked to oil grinding machines in place of bullocks, forced to extract 30 lbs of oil daily, facing beatings if they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
*   Many prisoners, often young, committed suicide or went mad due to the tortures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   Savarkar, a prolific poet, would write on cell walls with charcoal and his nails, only to have the walls whitewashed, yet memorized 4,000 lines of poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

Sampath suggests Kalapani should be a "place of pilgrimage" for Indian students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

#### Hindutva and Caste Eradication
Sampath clarifies that Savarkar's concept of Hindutva, as outlined in his book *Essentials of Hindutva*, had "nothing to do with the theological aspects of Hinduism as a religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Instead, it was conceived as a "cultural and a national identity marker" for those who consider India their sacred land, regardless of their religious faith (Jain, Muslim, Parsi, Sikh, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. He wrote this to counter the "dangerous" Khilafat Movement, which he saw as having "dangerous ramifications" and contributing to the "seeds of partition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

During his 13 years under house arrest in Ratnagiri, Savarkar worked for "complete elimination of cast," not just untouchability, aiming to unify Hindu society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

### [[reevaluation_of_historical_figures_like_v_d_savarkar_and_nathuram_godse | Nathuram Godse]]
Sampath discusses Nathuram Godse's motivations, noting that Godse was initially a close confidant and secretary to Savarkar within the Hindu Mahasabha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. However, Godse stated in court that Savarkar became a "pacifist" closer to independence, advocating support for the new Indian government, which led Godse and other hot-blooded young men to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

Godse's motivations for assassinating Gandhi stemmed from the violence of partition, the influx of refugees, and Gandhi's call on January 12, 1948, for the Indian government to pay 50 crores to Pakistan as promised, even as Pakistani forces were making incursions into Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. Godse and others viewed Gandhi as a "national security threat" at that critical juncture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. Sampath unequivocally condemns the assassination, stating that "death is not the answer to anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

Savarkar was implicated in Gandhi's murder due to his past affiliation with Godse, but after a year-long trial at the Red Fort and examination of all evidence, the judge "honorably exonerated" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. This exoneration was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

## Importance of Relearning History

Sampath highlights that India's current generation is arguably its first truly independent one, stressing the need to understand and value freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. He warns against the "divide and Rule situation" that has historically plagued India and is still seen today in internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>.

He emphasizes that a nation, like an individual, needs to heal its past wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. "Anything that is wounded needs healing; it needs to only then you can move ahead with confidence with closure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. History should not be used as a tool for "contemporary political correctness" or be based on "fabricated history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Instead, there needs to be an "honest assessment of our past" and a "Truth and Reconciliation" process to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

Sampath encourages individuals to read widely from diverse viewpoints—Left, Right, and Center—to form their own informed opinions rather than relying on rhetoric, assumptions, or propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This re-education process is crucial for shaping India's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

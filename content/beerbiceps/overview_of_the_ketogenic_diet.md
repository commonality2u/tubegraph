The [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a dietary approach that emphasizes very low carbohydrate intake to promote ketosis, a metabolic state where the body primarily burns fat for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Before embarking on this diet, it's recommended to understand if it's suitable for your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Principles

The fundamental rule of the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is to keep your overall [[importance_of_low_carb_intake_in_keto | carbs]] for the day below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Every single factual statement about food consumed, including ingredients like garlic, must contribute to this strict [[importance_of_low_carb_intake_in_keto | carb]] count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Dietary Adjustments Over Time

The [[meal_plan_for_keto_diet | diet plan]] for the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is not fixed and requires continuous adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Dermatology, while sometimes trivialized, is a field that requires a deep understanding of science and craft to effectively treat and improve skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">01:16:00</a>. Treating skin and improving it in the long term is "a lot about understanding the science and craft of dermatology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">01:22:20</a>. Every individual's body is different, meaning a food that suits one person may not suit another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:01">09:59:01</a>. This fundamental difference extends to how skin reacts to various factors, underscoring the [[importance_of_diet_and_lifestyle_for_skin_health | importance of personalized skincare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:01">10:19:01</a>.

## Why Skincare Needs to Be Personalized

### Individual Physiological Differences
Human anatomy, even something as "linear" as facial arteries, varies significantly from person to person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">11:08:00</a>. This principle applies to all bodily functions, including digestion and skin responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">11:11:00</a>. Factors like regional origin can influence how a body digests certain foods, for example, a North Indian system may be better suited to digesting wheat and *chana*, while a South Indian system may be better at digesting rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">11:58:00</a>. Each person's microbiome is unique, affected by their diet, medications (like antibiotics), and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">12:24:00</a>.

### Impact of Diet and Lifestyle on Skin Health
The [[impact_of_diet_on_skin_health | impact of diet on skin health]] is significant, with many skin conditions, including acne, being solvable through lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">06:17:00</a>. Issues like [[dietary_advice_for_healthy_glowing_skin | dietary advice for healthy glowing skin]] and poor sleep can lead to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">06:21:00</a>.

> "To me that is what sets me a part where I get to the diagnosis start very simple and you shouldn't be dependent on your dermatologist right that's the whole thing make them independent of you at some point and you know that's the goal to start with right from the beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">06:28:00</a>

Excessive protein supplements, especially without sufficient carbohydrates, can be inflammatory and lead to acne on the face and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">07:43:00</a>. Strict dieting regimens like zero-fat, zero-carb, or certain keto and intermittent fasting approaches can disrupt hormone cycles, leading to conditions like acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">08:24:00</a>. Pollution, sleeplessness, and addictions prevalent in metros also contribute to skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">08:52:00</a>.

### The Role of Stress
The [[role_of_stress_in_skin_problems | role of stress in skin problems]] is profound; the stress of looking good today is a major factor in skin issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">09:01:00</a>. Skin, hair, and nails serve as "diagnostic tools" for internal bodily processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">02:27:00</a>. When stress levels are high, acne can flare up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">01:48:00</a>. Yoga and *pranayama* (breathing exercises) can help balance hormones and calm the mind, leading to better skin due to improved physiological state and circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">01:27:32</a>.

### Age and Skin's Changing Needs
As individuals age, their bodies accept and reject different foods, and require less food due to reduced energy expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">01:31:45</a>. Skin requirements also change with age, making it essential to adapt skincare routines over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">01:32:08</a>.

## The Dermatologist's Approach to Personalized Skincare
A great dermatologist differentiates themselves by being a "legitimate, qualified, board-certified dermatologist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">05:33:00</a> and by acting as a "pure clinician at heart," focusing on accurate diagnosis and starting with the simplest solutions, such as lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">05:55:00</a>.

A detailed consultation is crucial to understand each patient's unique history, including childhood skin conditions, family history, travel, and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">01:13:29</a>. This thorough approach allows dermatologists to differentiate between patients and tailor treatment plans effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">01:13:29</a>.

### Clinical Examination vs. Blood Tests
While blood tests can indicate core problems, they are not randomly performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">01:12:00</a>. A dermatologist will only order blood tests if clinical examination and history suggest a hormonal imbalance or other underlying conditions, such as excess prolactin indicated by breast tenderness in men, or androgen excess in women with disrupted periods or hair growth on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">01:41:00</a>. Similarly, signs like dark, thick skin on the neck can indicate insulin resistance, prompting specific tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">01:44:48</a>.

### Tailoring Treatments
Treatments are highly personalized. For instance, antibiotics for acne are used for short durations (7-10 days, or pulse therapy for severe cases) to curb infection, while simultaneously supporting gut health with probiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:49">01:57:49</a>. Dermatologists may also recommend peels or other controlled topical treatments instead of prolonged internal medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:15">01:59:15</a>.

## Skincare Regimen: Cleanse, Protect, Nourish
A **basic skincare routine for different skin types** can be summarized as three steps: cleanse, protect, and nourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">01:16:32</a>.

*   **Cleansing**: Choosing the correct cleanser is paramount, as a wrong choice (e.g., a brightening face wash with acids for dry skin) can lead to irritation and pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">01:16:53</a>. For those exposed to pollution or heavy makeup, a pre-cleanse with oil-soluble products or micellar water may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">01:17:42</a>.
*   **Protection**: This involves shielding the skin from free radical damage, pollution, sun, and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">01:18:27</a>. Sunscreen is essential for everyone, as modern formulations protect from UV rays, visible light, and infrared rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">01:18:35</a>. Moisturizer also acts as a protective barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">01:19:41</a>.
*   **Nourishment**: This step involves providing the skin with what it needs to quench and calm itself, such as good moisturizers for dry skin or mists for dehydrated skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">01:19:50</a>. Skin health relies on a combination of water, oil, and proteins (peptides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">01:16:03</a>.
*   **Correction and Enhancement**: This optional fourth step involves targeted serums, acids, and treatments to address specific concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">01:20:10</a>.

### Specific Skincare Elements

#### Exfoliation
Gentle exfoliation is recommended once a week to loosen and remove the top dead layer of skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">01:07:17</a>. Harsh scrubbing is discouraged as it can damage the skin barrier and disrupt the skin microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">01:06:27</a>. Physical exfoliation with fine, smooth granules or chemical exfoliation with acids (AHAs, BHAs) are preferred methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">01:08:04</a>.

#### Active Ingredients
*   **Retinol**: An effective anti-aging ingredient that increases cell turnover and can treat acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">01:34:32</a>. However, it is not suitable for everyone, especially those with thin, dry, or sensitive skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">01:35:04</a>. Those using retinol must commit to strict sun protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">01:37:22</a>.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid**: A popular ingredient for hydration, but it's an acid and can irritate very dry or sensitive skin. It works best on normal, calm, or oily skin that needs hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">01:37:59</a>.
*   **Vitamin C**: While an antioxidant, it can be harmful if the skin is dry, chapped, eczematic, sensitive, or sunburned, as it can sensitize and burn the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">01:14:23</a>.

#### Medical Treatments
*   **Accutane (Isotretinoin)**: A powerful oral retinoid that effectively dries out oil glands, treating severe acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">01:39:50</a>. While highly effective, it has side effects like dry eyes, lips, skin, and hair fall, and can be toxic to the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">01:40:06</a>. It is teratogenic (can cause birth defects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">01:40:20</a>. Its use should be carefully monitored by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">01:43:02</a>.
*   **Micro-needling Radiofrequency**: A procedure that uses tiny needles to deliver radiofrequency at specific depths, shrinking oil glands permanently and simultaneously treating scars by increasing collagen production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">01:41:36</a>. This is a common and effective alternative to prolonged isotretinoin use for managing oiliness and improving skin texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">01:42:07</a>.
*   **Peels**: Chemical exfoliants of varying depths (superficial, medium, deep) used to clear complexion, brighten skin, fade acne scars, and even out skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">01:47:55</a>. Deeper peels are generally not recommended for brown skin due to a higher risk of scarring and hyperpigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">01:49:53</a>.

## Importance of Professional Guidance
The field of dermatology is diluted with many claiming to be "skincare experts," including those without proper qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">01:11:00</a>. It is crucial to seek a qualified, board-certified dermatologist for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">05:33:00</a>. Skincare is not fashion; applying the wrong product, even once, can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">01:13:35</a>.

> "There is no deals there is no discounts there is no sale there is no anniversary sale you need to please go for this is not passion this is really medicine this is if you give that respect to that it will treat you that respectfully back is what I feel respectfully back so you need to know this is not where you bargain this is not very where you look for cheap things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">01:44:40</a>

Patients should avoid "deals" or cheap medical treatments, as quality and safety are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">01:44:34</a>. The reuse of disposable components in procedures like micro-needling can lead to serious complications such as infection or skin damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:21">01:45:21</a>.

## Psychological Impact of Skin Health
Skin conditions, even seemingly minor ones like acne, can cause significant psychological distress, leading to pain, self-consciousness, and reduced confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">00:41:00</a>. Effective skincare and medical intervention can profoundly improve a person's quality of life, boost confidence, and even impact career and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:57">02:05:57</a>. It is important to acknowledge that the desire to look good is valid, and seeking professional help for cosmetic issues should not be judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:30">02:06:30</a>.

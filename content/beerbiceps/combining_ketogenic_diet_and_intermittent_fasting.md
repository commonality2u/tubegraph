Combining [[intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] with a [[Ketogenic Diet and Exercise | ketogenic diet]] is referred to as "Level 7" on a weight loss scale, offering an extreme protocol for rapid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:41">[09:39:41]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits
The main goal of combining these two methods is to accelerate the speed of weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:50">[09:48:50]</a>. Both [[Ketogenic Diet and Exercise | keto]] and [[intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] individually hasten the rate of weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:52">[09:50:52]</a>. It is considered safe to combine them to achieve a super fast rate of weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:56">[09:54:56]</a>. By strictly following the rules of both [[intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] and [[Ketogenic Diet and Exercise | keto]], it is possible to lose 5 kilograms in one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:01">[10:01:01]</a>.

## Challenges
It is important to note that combining these already difficult protocols makes it a very challenging regimen to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.

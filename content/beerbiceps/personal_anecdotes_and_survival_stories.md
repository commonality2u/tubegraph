This article delves into the personal anecdotes and [[military_experiences_and_storytelling | survival stories]] shared by Major Viv Jacob, a highly respected Special Forces veteran, during his conversation on TRS. These accounts highlight the extreme challenges faced in combat, the unique mindset developed by Special Forces personnel, and profound reflections on life, consciousness, and the nature of reality.

## The Reality of Combat
Major Viv Jacob shares insights into the brutal realities of battlefield encounters, where decisions have immediate life-or-death consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the internet often does not see the "rawest form" of [[military_experiences_and_storytelling | military stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### An Unforgettable Injury
One harrowing account involves a young soldier who faced a head-on contact with an enemy combatant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The enemy fired first, and the bullet hit the soldier's bulletproof vest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The impact caused the bulletproof material to collapse, cracking his skull and causing his eye to pop out and hang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite this horrific injury, the soldier instinctively killed the enemy combatant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The soldier, described as a "fantastic" and "lovely soul" who was "deadly in combat," spent many months in a military hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. He lost his memory, forgetting his family and his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Months later, his memory gradually returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. The incident left him disfigured, leading to the breakup of his engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Though initially heartbroken and self-judging, he eventually found acceptance and recovered much of his former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### The Landmine Incident
Major Jacob recounts a mission where, for the first time in over a decade of service, he experienced intense discomfort and anxiety without an apparent external cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This feeling grew to a point where he instinctively wanted to extract from the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. Despite the internal struggle and the temptation of comfort at base, he decided to stay put, believing his desire to leave stemmed from laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Shortly after, an explosion occurred, and his teammate stepped on a mine, losing his leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

This created immediate chaos, with the injured teammate spurting blood far from base in a mine-filled, pitch-dark environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. In such moments, the difference between life and death depends on immediate action and how one handles the chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Major Jacob immediately went into "repair mode," administering morphine, replacing blood loss, stemming the flow of blood, and bandaging the wound to extend the teammate's life until extraction and surgery were possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Encounters with Wildlife
Operating in raw nature, Special Forces personnel often merge with their surroundings not just physically but also at a deeper consciousness level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### The Leopard on Sentry Duty
While on sentry duty in complete darkness in a dangerous, forested mountain area, Major Jacob was sitting with his weapon on his lap, staring into the darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. After about an hour and a half, he heard a noise very close to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. Switching on his night vision goggles, he turned to see a leopard sitting right next to him, less than a meter away, staring in the same direction he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. He immediately pointed his weapon at the leopard, safety off, finger on the trigger, ready to fire if attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. After about four or five minutes, the leopard calmly got up and walked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

Major Jacob believes this peaceful coexistence occurred because both he and the leopard were not "thinking" but were fully immersed in the moment and the physical surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. Soldiers, having not bathed for weeks and smelling like the forest, become familiar to animals, and the absence of fear in the soldier is sensed by the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

### The Charging Bear
Bears, though appearing cute, are incredibly dangerous animals with immense strength, long sharp claws, and speed, capable of tearing a person apart or scalping them with one swipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. The most dangerous is a mother bear with cubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

Major Jacob recounts an incident while operating in a mountain range, where his team passed an apple orchard where villagers were sitting by fires, suggesting the presence of bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. While scouting for a vantage point, he discovered a small cave with a comfortable bed of dry grass and large animal droppings with seeds in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Later that night, while observing with a thermal imager from a cliff edge, he heard heavy movement below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Two large bears emerged and began climbing directly towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

One bear stood up, smelt the soldiers, then tried to climb around them, eventually getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. It came back down and, alongside the other bear, charged directly at Major Jacob, who was at the front of the line with his legs hanging over the cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. The bear stopped just two meters away, standing upright and roaring into his face, spit falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. Major Jacob had his weapon raised, but the small caliber bullets would not guarantee a kill, and firing would reveal their position to enemy forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. In that intense moment, a local SF soldier behind him quickly switched on a laser light and flashed it into the bear's eyes, causing it to stumble backward and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

## Spiritual and Psychological Insights
Major Jacob's [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | personal growth and self-discovery]] has been deeply influenced by his [[military_experiences_and_storytelling | military experiences and storytelling]], leading him to reflect on the nature of reality and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Flow State and Intuition
Special Forces training cultivates a unique mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. In combat, soldiers must enter a "flow state," surrendering to the situation, accepting the chaos, and becoming aware of opportunities to make the critical choice for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This state involves letting go of the past, future, and all judgments to focus entirely on the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

Major Jacob highlights the development of a "sixth sense" or intuition in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Over time, he began to feel when something was going to happen before it actually did, sometimes even five or six hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This happens as one sheds the ego and expands into a realm where space, time, and energy are unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### The Near-Death Experience
Major Jacob describes a situation where he was trapped on a cliff, holding onto grass, with a deep drop below, facing an armed enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. He says it was an "impossible situation" with "0% chance" of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. In that moment, he experienced what science calls a "near-death experience," a burst of DMT in the brain where his entire life flashed before his eyes like a photo album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This "time dilation" allowed him to review decades of life in "no time" at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. The experience was detached and emotionless, devoid of judgment, regret, or guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] How did he survive?
> When asked how he survived, Major Jacob states, "Everything turned on its head from where it was to what happened... i'd rather not talk about it." He implies that the enemy combatant chose not to shoot him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>. He considers it a manifestation of an "alternative form of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>.

### The Siachen Glacier
Major Jacob's posting on the Siachen Glacier was the most intense experience of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. Temperatures are so extreme that water freezes in the air, and vegetables become rock solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. The exposed skin burns and loses sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. The environment is constantly fraught with dangers like enemy action, raids, and artillery shelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. He describes the sound of an incoming artillery shell as "Terror in Supreme form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Hearing the whistle means it's flying overhead, but if the whistle stops, it means it's coming for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. He experienced a shell landing just outside his bed, disintegrating metal into razor-sharp molten shards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. He concludes that soldiers operate in a "dimension of death" where anything can happen at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:09">[01:51:09]</a>.

## Reflections on Life and Consciousness

### Karma and Perception
Major Jacob believes that "karma" exists for those whose neural networks are formed to perceive cause and effect as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. However, for "consciousnesses which have zoomed out," karma is an illusion, like everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. He argues that reality is what an individual's consciousness perceives, comparing it to different painters using the same colors to create different pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Soldiers, initially focused on duty, might later reflect on their experiences and evolve their perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

### The Dream Analogy
Major Jacob offers a profound perspective: all of reality is an illusion, a dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:03">[01:42:03]</a>. He uses the analogy of Vishnu dreaming the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>. In a personal dream, all events and people feel real at the time, but upon waking, one realizes it was all a dream happening within one's own consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>. Similarly, our human experience is a dream within a "cosmic mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:16">[01:44:16]</a>. The insight is that since the dream is happening in one's own "head," once this is realized, one can then "dream the dream you wish to dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>.

### The Human Ability Biome
Major Jacob is involved in "Soul of Steel," a program that combines military mountaineering and combat experiences with adventure and mountaineering skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. It teaches unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, [[survival skills and training in the army | survival skills]], and navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a>. The goal is to put participants in real-world situations to help them realize their own potential and become better human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>.

He believes everyone has a "God inside them," a supreme consciousness and ability that is hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. The "human ability biome" aims to create circumstances and infrastructure to help individuals realize this potential, from people with disabilities to Olympic athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a>. The ultimate aim is to foster love, joy, peace, and capability in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:39">[01:59:39]</a>.

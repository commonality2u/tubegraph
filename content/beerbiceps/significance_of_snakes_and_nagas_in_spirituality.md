Snakes hold a peculiar and powerful symbolism within [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_India | spiritual beliefs and practices]], possessing an innate energy that is considered superlative to almost all other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. Their significance transcends mere reptilian existence, often appearing in the iconography and narratives of various deities and spiritual traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Symbolism and Divine Connection

Snakes are depicted prominently alongside major deities in [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Hindu mythology]], signifying their deep spiritual connection:
*   **Shiva:** A snake is often seen around Shiva's neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Vishnu:** Vishnu is traditionally shown resting on a snake, specifically Sheshnag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>, who is also considered an *amsa* (portion of energy) of Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.
*   **Goddesses:** Goddesses like Matara are depicted with snakes as girdles or anklets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>.
*   **Bhairava:** Bhairava, a form of Shiva, wears a *janu* (sacred thread) made of snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

The presence of snakes near highly spiritually charged individuals or rituals indicates a strong spiritual energy or the presence of a powerful being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. This is exemplified in stories where snakes remain calm even around the most poisonous ones in the presence of gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>, or circle a ritual fire without fear, showing reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## Nagas: Evolved Beings with Occult Powers

The term "snake" in ancient texts often refers to different entities:
*   **Nagas vs. Serpents:** In Sanskrit, two terms are used: *nagas* and *serpas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Nagas are considered a specific kind of being, powerful reptilian beings, with highly developed occult powers and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.
*   **Siddhis:** Nagas had the capacity to manifest various *siddhis*, which are special powers attained by yogis at a high spiritual level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.
*   **Connection to Spiritual Knowledge:** They are believed to be naturally drawn to entities with greater spiritual power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. For instance, Buddhist texts mention a Naga providing shelter to Buddha during meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>. Patanjali, who codified the yoga sutras, is also believed to have been a Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Masters of Spiritual Techniques:** Nagas possessed absolute mastery of specific spiritual techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. Their knowledge is often considered exclusive and not suitable for the average human, given its intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.
*   **Benefactors:** A Naga can act as a benefactor or protector for an individual, either through ritual or automatically, when there is a higher level of spiritual power present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.
*   **Naga Mani:** Certain Nagas are believed to develop a jewel (*Naga Mani*) in their head after living for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>. Obtaining this gem is said to accelerate one's life in all aspectsâ€”material, spiritual, and otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. Nagas are also believed to guard such precious treasures to prevent them from falling into undeserving hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

## Karma and Respect for Snakes

Ancient scriptures, like the Mahabharata, detail engagements between humans and snakes, indicating a deeper connection than currently perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   **Repercussions of Harm:** Harming snakes, especially poisonous ones, is believed to invite troubles and negative karmic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. These actions can trigger negative combinations in one's horoscope, leading to life difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.
*   **Naga Dosha:** In Jyotisha (Vedic astrology), certain afflictions are called *naga dosha* or *sarpa dosha*, which can cause friction in life, difficulties in relationships, or conceiving children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Specific rituals and pujas are performed to appease these *doshas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   **Interactions:** Snakes are inherently individualistic creatures and prefer not to be disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. If a snake enters human territory, it is advised to call animal control rather than harming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>.

## Modern Day Encounters and Discernment

While modern snakes are largely animalistic, some can be *entities* that take the form of snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>. Rituals and mantras can discern if an encounter is with a normal reptile or a spiritual entity, which may be an ancestor in a "bad shape" due to unperformed rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>.

## Nagas and Spiritual Knowledge

Nagas are believed to still exist, but they are more hidden in their own domains and do not appear to individuals unless they achieve a certain spiritual proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>.
*   **Kundalini Shakti:** The symbolic connection of snakes to Kundalini Shakti is prominent, as the Kundalini is often depicted as a coiled snake rising through the chakras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.
*   **Spectrum of Beings:** Just as with humans, there are highly evolved snakes and lower-category snakes, symbolizing both spiritual advancement and negative qualities like jealousy and bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. However, truly evolved Nagas are rare and can even bestow blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.
*   **Hidden Treasures:** Nagas are believed to guard various forms of wealth, not just material, but also hidden knowledge or precious spiritual items, ensuring they do not fall into undeserving hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.

Naga worship still exists today, particularly in places like Kerala, where temples are dedicated to Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. The lore and stories surrounding these beings are believed to always contain an element of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>.

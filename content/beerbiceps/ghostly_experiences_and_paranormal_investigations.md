This article explores the nature of ghosts and other supernatural entities, drawing from the experiences and research of horror writer Neil D'Silva and discussions with paranormal investigators. It delves into various cultural beliefs surrounding spirits, personal encounters, and the methods used in [[paranormal_investigation_methods | paranormal investigation methods]].

## Understanding Supernatural Entities

### Chudel and Diyan
The Chudel and Diyan share a similar origin theory: a woman who dies during childbirth or while pregnant and is not properly cremated with all rituals turns into a Chudel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This entity remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Diyan are described as being on almost similar lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### [[yakinis_and_paranormal_entities | Yakshini]]
[[yakinis_and_paranormal_entities | Yakshini]] are considered demigoddesses prevalent in South India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven called Alkapuri, governed by Kubera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Kubera is described as Ravana's brother and protector of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. When [[yakinis_and_paranormal_entities | Yakshini]] come to Earth, they are mostly in evil forms, appearing beautiful and voluptuous, but revealing their evil nature once their seduction has worn off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Their victims are typically men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Pishach
The Pishach, a ghoul in Hindu mythology, is believed to be created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Unlike poltergeists, a Pishach can kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Poltergeists
Poltergeists are described as noisy ghosts that are mischievous and naughty, trying to disorient and sap energies, but they hardly kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Betal
A Betal is a hanging ghost that clings to trees, similar to a gargoyle in appearance but usually formless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. It is believed to be a man who died with unfulfilled wishes and remains attached to a permanent structure like a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Betals are said to haunt passersby, travel to their homes, and jeopardize their lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Ghosts
It is generally believed that the realm of ghosts is full of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. According to spiritual books like the *Guran* and *Autobiography of a Yogi*, when someone has an unnatural death before their destined time, they spend the remainder of that time in this realm as a ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Most ghosts are considered good, but evil ghosts are those with unfulfilled desires or who experienced an unjust or violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Personal [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | Experiences with Demonic Entities]] and Hauntings
Neil D'Silva believes that writing horror attracts horror into one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He recounts an experience in Goa while writing a horror novel in a desolate cottage: he felt something cold pass by, and the lights in his room started flickering intensely, while lights in other parts of the cottage remained stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The host shares several [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | experiences with demonic entities]]:
*   **Fear of the Dark:** A strong childhood fear of the dark, including a recurring vision of a man dropping from the ceiling to grab him, which later influenced his art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **[[Sleep paralysis and personal experiences | Sleep paralysis and personal experiences]]**: A very strong [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis and personal experiences]] experience that was later confirmed as real by another psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Witchcraft Encounter**: An experience with a woman met through a dating app who revealed her involvement in witchcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. This encounter involved visiting locations known for ghostly activity, a feeling of dizziness, and a psychic friend sensing a "dark aura" and instructing a cleansing mantra and a salt water bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. During meditation, the host felt a physical sensation like a pin shoved into his finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

## [[paranormal_investigation_methods | Paranormal Investigation Methods]] and Theories
Neil D'Silva began studying the paranormal more deeply when writing about ghosts, meeting [[paranormal_investigation_methods | paranormal investigation methods]] and [[scientific_investigation_of_haunted_locations | scientific investigation of haunted locations]] who dedicate their time to finding the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He notes that no two paranormal investigators share the exact same theory for ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Perspectives from Investigators
*   **Jay Alani:** A rationalist who believes a significant portion of the paranormal world, especially in [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | India]], is fueled by blind faith, superstition, and commercial propagation (e.g., black magic used to make money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He seeks to distinguish between what is truly occult and what is fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Jay's approach often involves identifying a "root cause" or "epicenter" for hauntings, which can sometimes be a human playing mischief or an object carrying a spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Sarbajit Maity:** Believes that paranormal energies are all around us, existing in another dimension, capable of perceiving humans though humans cannot interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Role of Psychics
Psychics are integral to investigation teams, possessing an enhanced sense to perceive dark energies and even visualize entities where normal people only feel "creeped out" or see shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### Role of Objects in Hauntings
Objects can serve as epicenters for hauntings. For example, a seemingly harmless souvenir cup bought from a foreign country was found to be possessed by a spirit, leading to a terrible motorcycle accident for its owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The Warrens, famous paranormal investigators, maintained a museum filled with such possessed artifacts, including the Annabelle doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### Science vs. Paranormal
Neil, a postgraduate in organic chemistry, notes the difficulty of scientifically proving the existence of another world that is "just energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. While devices like K2 meters can detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) where there shouldn't be any, suggesting a paranormal presence, they do not offer direct visual proof of a ghostly entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Witchcraft and Black Magic
The village of Mayong in Assam, [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | India]], is believed to be the birthplace of black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Practitioners there use black magic for healing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>, with tantrics and ojas performing mantras to spiritually cleanse people suffering from ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

Black magic is sometimes associated with taking something from another person, such as youth or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

## Cultural Beliefs and Haunted Locations in [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | India]]
[[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | India]] is rich in spiritual wisdom, but also has an "underbelly of spiritualism" involving occult practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Haunted Locations
*   **Delhi:** Believed to be one of the most haunted places due to its age and history of battles, leaving behind "angst and pain" from the ghosts of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Bhubaneswar Tree:** A specific tree in a village near Bhubaneswar where young boys would inexplicably wake up, walk to the tree, and hang themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Paranormal investigators sensed a huge mass of "black energy" around the tree. Attempts to cut down the tree were met with the woodcutters falling sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Mumbai Locations:** Juhu Beach, Bandstand, and Carter Road are mentioned as specific locations where the host's psychic friend has had ghost encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### Trees and Spirits
In [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | India]], it is commonly advised not to urinate on trees or walk under specific trees like Banyan or Peepal trees at night, as they are believed to house spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Cleansing Rituals
Mantra chanting and meditation are believed to cleanse environments and counter dark energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Salt water baths are also considered common for washing off negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

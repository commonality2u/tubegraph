[[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay Bhat's]] journey with fitness and weight loss began when the interviewer, BeerBiceps, became his first personal coaching client, helping him with his weight loss journey in the early days of YouTube [00:00:13]. In return, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] mentored the interviewer in the media industry [00:00:19]. This mutual exchange highlights the significant role fitness has played in [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay's]] life and career [00:01:03].

## Early Struggles and Motivation
In his earlier years, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] struggled with his weight, describing himself as a "fat kid" [00:07:07]. This perception fueled a drive for success, as he sought to own something other than looks, leading him to focus intensely on studies, extracurricular activities, and eventually a career in media and comedy [00:07:12]. This "need to hustle" [00:07:54] was initially driven by a desire for gratification and audience approval, which he now views as stemming from a "void" he was trying to fill [00:08:15].

The initial training with BeerBiceps helped [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] achieve a "sexy ass shape back in the day" [00:02:24] and taught him self-sufficiency in fitness [00:24:52]. He learned that fitness is not rocket science but requires discipline, gaining what he calls a "diploma in Fitness" [00:25:27]. This foundational knowledge means he no longer needs a trainer for guidance, though he still requires someone to spot him during workouts [00:25:07].

## A Near-Death Experience
At his heaviest, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] weighed 245 kilograms [00:49:00]. This extreme weight led to acute sleep apnea, causing him to stop breathing during sleep due to insufficient oxygen reaching his brain, which resulted in seizures [00:49:07]. He would wake up four times every night unable to sleep [00:49:20].

During a medical check-up, his neck muscles collapsed, and he temporarily stopped breathing, requiring resuscitation [00:49:33]. He spent six days in the ICU [00:49:56] after this incident, which occurred just two days after the AIB roast, a period where he gained significant weight by eating "10 ice creams a day" and consuming his anxiety [00:50:00]. This near-death experience became a critical turning point for him to get his life in order [00:50:24].

## A Shift in Approach
Currently, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] is actively working on his fitness. His goal is to achieve a jawline [00:41:30], having already dropped 8 kilograms in 2.5 months [00:41:32]. His current routine involves:
*   **Waking up late:** 2 PM [00:03:00].
*   **Working on creative projects and stand-up comedy:** 2 PM to 9 PM [00:03:09].
*   **Streaming and shooting videos:** After 11 PM [00:03:42].
*   **Sleeping:** Around 7 AM [00:03:51].

He prioritizes a long-term, marathon approach to weight loss rather than quick sprints, aiming for steady progress to avoid burnout [00:41:56]. He loses a consistent 4 kilograms per month through diet and cardio [00:42:54]. While he enjoyed weight training in the past and notes his body's capacity for it [00:55:47], he is currently focusing on diet and activities like badminton (2-3 times a week) [00:55:32] for cardio, with plans to introduce weight training later to "shock" his body and prevent plateaus [00:56:04]. He also uses public accountability by vlogging about his journey [00:43:03].

His relationship with food has also evolved. While he used to "binge cheat" on diets, his mindset has changed; now, even when cheating, he consumes normal meals and cuts out sugar [00:54:10]. He admits to emotional eating and struggling with "mind is bored" or "indisciplined" eating habits, emphasizing the mental aspect of food [00:59:02].

## The Mental Aspect of Weight Loss
[[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] highlights that weight loss is not just a physical exercise but "equally a painful mental exercise" [00:58:53]. He believes his body wants to be fat because, deep down, he may not feel he deserves happiness, a belief rooted in past bullying experiences [00:59:19].

He recounts a traumatic childhood memory of being body-shamed by slum kids who would pull his pants down and mock him [00:57:04]. He emphasizes that many adults who were overweight as children haven't processed the trauma of bullying, leading to suppressed memories and a belief that "I am terrible, there's something wrong with me" [00:57:16]. He advises overweight kids to allow themselves to cry and process their emotions, especially men who often lack the skills to vent emotionally [00:57:38].

Despite the challenges, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] recognizes the positive impact of weight loss on one's thought process and confidence [00:58:28]. He strongly suggests that kids, even if not aiming for a "six-pack," should work towards fitness, as the process itself will drastically change their thought process, leading to increased confidence and a belief in their own worth [01:03:27].

## Lessons Learned
Through his journey, [[Tanmay Bhats comeback and life challenges | Tanmay]] has learned the importance of patience and playing "long-term games" in life, rather than being rushed by the immediate gratification often seen in social media [01:05:05]. He understands that wisdom comes from experiences, not just years, and despite being only 32, he feels he has accumulated significant life wisdom through his ups and downs [00:33:05].

Military operations, particularly those involving [[Experiences of Indian Special Forces | Special Forces]], frequently place soldiers in direct and prolonged contact with raw, untamed nature, fostering a unique relationship with their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Unlike civilian life in cities, where wildlife is minimal, soldiers operate in high-altitude mountains, deep forests, and remote areas away from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

## Living in Raw Nature

Soldiers, by the very nature of their work, are immersed in the wild, often for extended periods. This close contact with nature leads to a physical and conscious merging with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. Without regular access to amenities, soldiers' bodies revert to a more natural state, even aligning their scent with the forest, making them less of an anomaly to wild animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

The extreme cold of locations like Siachen means everything freezes solid, and human bodily fluids like sweat can form icicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>. This constant exposure to harsh elements, devoid of urban comforts, necessitates an adaptation that reshapes perception of reality and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

## Merging with Nature: Animal Encounters

A significant aspect of this interaction is the frequent encounters with wild animals, which can range from peaceful co-existence to intense, life-threatening situations. Animals, operating purely on instinct, are often perceived as having a "higher consciousness" due to their lack of judgment and attachment to complex thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. They can sense fear, and a soldier in a [[handling_highpressure_situations_and_combat | flow state]] without fear is often perceived differently by animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### The Leopard Encounter

One notable instance involved a Special Forces soldier on Sentry duty in pitch darkness in a dangerous, forested mountain area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. After about an hour and a half, he heard a noise nearby and, upon activating his night vision goggles, discovered a leopard sitting less than a meter away, staring in the same direction he had been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. The soldier prepared his weapon, but the leopard, sensing no aggression or fear, simply got up and walked away after a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This peaceful co-existence demonstrated a shared "peace" and alignment in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### Understanding Bears

Bears, though they can appear cute, are extremely dangerous animals in Indian forests, possessing immense strength, long, sharp claws, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. A single swipe can disfigure a face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. Mother bears with cubs are the most dangerous and likely to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. Despite the danger, Special Forces soldiers rarely get bitten by snakes or scorpions, suggesting an alignment with wild animals where conflict is avoided unless paths directly clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

### The Charging Bear

During an operation, a soldier and his team observed two large bears moving towards them from below a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. The bears were heading towards their cave, which the soldiers were inadvertently blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. One bear charged directly at the lead soldier, stopping just two meters away and roaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. In a [[handling_highpressure_situations_and_combat | flow state]], the soldier aimed his weapon, prepared to fire only if necessary, weighing the consequences of gunfire (revealing their position) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. A teammate, a local Special Forces soldier, flashed a red laser light into the bear's eyes, startling it and causing it to stumble backward and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. In such moments of extreme danger, fear vanishes, and there is only focus on the immediate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

## Spiritual Aspect of Nature Interaction

The intense and frequent exposure to life-or-death situations in nature also opens soldiers to profound [[mental_and_spiritual_aspects_of_being_a_soldier | spiritual insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. By surrendering the mind's duality (life/death, past/future) and entering a flow state, soldiers can tap into a spiritual dimension where intuition and a "sixth sense" become prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

One experience involved a high-altitude lake hidden within a thick forest. Upon encountering two ducks swimming on the turquoise-blue lake, the soldier had a powerful realization: they were "two Gods who have descended in Duck form and they're Romancing together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>. This magical vision reflected a belief that Gods descend to this place at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. Such experiences reinforce the idea that nature is not merely a backdrop but a living, aware entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

The organization "Claw," founded by Major Vivek Jacob post-military career, integrates these [[military_training_and_preparation | military experiences]] and [[survival_skills_and_training_in_the_army | survival skills]] with mountaineering, aiming to unleash human potential by interacting with the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. This initiative, called "Soul of Steel," emphasizes creating "human ability biomes" to help individuals realize their "godliness" through challenging natural circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>.

[[Aurangzeb and his rule | Emperor Aurangzeb]]'s reign and rise to power are characterized by ruthless ambition, military prowess, and complex political maneuvering within [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | the Mughal Empire]]. His rule and personality are critical to understanding [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | the historical context of India]] during the 17th century, especially in relation to [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Ascent to Power

The ascent of [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] to the throne was marked by a brutal succession struggle, a common pattern within the Mughal dynasty where there was no established rule for the first son to become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. It was a choice between "the throne or the grave" for contenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

[[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s father, Shah Jahan, sent him to less fertile provinces like the Kabul borders to fight wars, giving him less money and military power compared to his brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. This environment made [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. He developed a strategy to gain power, realizing he lacked funds compared to his brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

He aimed to conquer the wealthy Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi states in the Deccan, which had treasuries of 10-15 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. These states, particularly Hyderabad, were rich from trade, including diamonds and elephants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. By acquiring these kingdoms, he could gain vast wealth and strengthen his army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. He attacked Adil Shahi and Hyderabad, nearly capturing them, but Shah Jahan intervened, ordering him back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Despite this, [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] acquired some land and money, increasing his army's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

### Conflict with Brothers
[[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s rise involved eliminating his brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. He used cunning tactics and exploited existing rivalries:
*   **Dara Shikoh**: Praised for his secularism and intellectual pursuits, Dara Shikoh was Shah Jahan's favorite, but [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] viewed him as an "idolater" and "non-believer" due to his discussions of [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | religion]] with Hindu, Christian, and Muslim pundits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Dara Shikoh was given the fertile provinces of Punjab and the Ganges belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. During the decisive battle, Dara Shikoh wasted three days deliberating whether to attack, allowing [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s army to rest and strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] used [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | religion]] to rally his soldiers against Dara Shikoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. Dara Shikoh was defeated and fled to Delhi, then towards the borders of Afghanistan and Iran (possibly Balochistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. He was caught by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, brought back to Delhi, tried under Sharia law, and beheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. His "crime" was writing a book called "Mingling of Two Oceans," which sought to unite two religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Murad**: The youngest and "drunken" brother, Murad, was sent to Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] wrote to Murad, feigning humility and religious devotion, stating he did not want to be emperor and would support Murad for the throne, provided they attacked Shah Jahan together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. Murad, having committed crimes in Gujarat, joined [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. After [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] took the throne, Murad was imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a> and later died from an opium overdose or was hung after a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
*   **Shah Shuja**: Sent to Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>, Shah Shuja was described as a womanizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. He was eventually killed by cannibals in Arakan (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma border) after being driven deep into Bengal by [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>, and his entire family was reportedly eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
*   **Shah Jahan**: [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] imprisoned his own father, Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

[[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] also imprisoned his own sons, Muhammad Sultan (his first-born), who died of depression at age 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

## Characteristics of Aurangzeb's Rule

[[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]]'s mind was considered his "biggest, sharpest weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. He was highly intelligent and ruthless, adept at using people and manipulating [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | religion]] to his advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. He was a skilled warrior and politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

### Military Strength
At its peak, [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | the Mughal Empire]] under [[Aurangzeb and his rule | Aurangzeb]] was collecting 12 million rupees in revenue, primarily from agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. The empire had 200,000 heavy-duty cavalrymen, 40,000 artillerymen, and foot soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. The artillerymen were trained by the Portuguese and used lightweight cannons that could be shifted on horseback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. They used both explosive cannon fire and large iron cannonballs to destroy structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

The Mughal army was feared due to its immense numbers, with nearly half a million soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. These soldiers came from across the subcontinent, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkistanis, and even some Russians from the Volga region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. There were also Indian Hindus and Marathas in the Mughal army, particularly from Madhya Pradesh and Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. Racial discrimination was present, with darker-skinned Indian soldiers being paid less than foreign ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

### Governance and Society
Eighty percent of [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | the Mughal Empire]]'s territory was controlled by military men called Mansabdars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. A Mansabdar was a warrior granted land by the king or sultan, responsible for collecting taxes from cultivators and maintaining a cavalry force for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. They lived like "mini-kings" and were feared by the local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. This system meant that common people often did not receive justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

During this period, India experienced a significant decline in self-esteem, with people accepting being secondary citizens due to brutal treatment by invaders, including mass killings, torture, and the abduction of women and children as property or sex slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. The North suffered from invasions from the 12th-13th century onwards, with the Deccan suffering later, from the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>. The terms "Sultani Calamity" (calamity from raids) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disaster) were common, reflecting the pervasive fear and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>. This period of [[the_socioeconomic_conditions_of_india_before_shivajis_empire | suffering and vulnerability]] shaped the mentality of the average Indian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

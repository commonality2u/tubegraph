## Parental Influence and [[impact_of_upbringing_and_family_on_priyanka_chopras_life | Upbringing]]

Priyanka Chopra's parents, both physicians in the Army, instilled in her crucial values and principles that shaped her character and [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | ambitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### A Relationship of Equals
Chopra highlights her parents' relationship as a model of equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. They shared responsibilities, worked together, and always respected each other's opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This upbringing fostered an environment where her mother's opinion was considered as important as her father's, and decisions were made jointly, contributing to an "extremely healthy marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Discipline and Perseverance
From her military parents, Chopra learned that discipline is not just about punctuality, but about being prepared, training, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This means committing 120% to any task, knowing that even a small mistake can have a large impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Embracing Failure and Hustle
Her father was her "biggest champion" and taught her to smile through everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The most significant lesson from him was the "hustle" – not to fear failure, but to let the next action define you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. He emphasized finding the courage to do things differently after making a mistake instead of dwelling on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Unwavering Support
Her parents fostered an environment where she was encouraged to pursue every dream and aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. They wanted her to avoid any "what ifs" in life and taught her to always have the confidence to communicate, even about mistakes, stating they would help her no matter what, while still ensuring accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Professional Learning and Growth

Priyanka Chopra views her professional interactions as opportunities for continuous learning and self-improvement.

### Learning from Criticism
Early in her [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | career]], during the filming of *Andaz*, choreographer Rajuk Khan criticized her dancing after numerous takes, telling her to "go learn how to dance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Instead of being deterred, Chopra used this as motivation, learning Kathak for six hours a day, which she credits with realizing the power of knowledge and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Strategic Collaborations
As a producer, Chopra deliberately chose to produce *The Sky Is Pink* with Sid Roy Kapoor and Ronnie Scala because she tremendously admired them and had done six films with them previously that "defined [her] career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Her decision was driven by the desire to continue learning from experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Principles of Healthy [[The impact of relationships on personal growth | Relationships]]

Chopra applies several core principles to all her [[The impact of relationships on personal growth | relationships]], whether personal or professional.

### Honesty and Authenticity
She believes that honesty is paramount in [[The impact of relationships on personal growth | relationships]] with friends, family, or romantic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Being "real to what you really are feeling" is crucial, even if it means having the courage to call someone out or express disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The healthiest connections allow for open communication, where one can remove the "cloak of being careful about your emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Seeking Support for [[Priyanka Chopras approach to mental health | Mental Health]]
After her father's passing and during her transition to a new country and industry, Chopra experienced what she felt was a period of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While she tried therapy without consistency, she learned the importance of "allow[ing] myself to feel it" and accepting her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. She initially tried to keep busy with work, but realized this was "running away from [her] issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Her key takeaway is the necessity of finding support and not being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. She relied heavily on her friends during this time, choosing to seek out people who cared about her rather than dealing with it in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. She advises others to talk to someone—be it a therapist, a parent, or a friend—rather than keeping dark feelings to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Maintaining Privacy
Despite being a public figure, Chopra chooses to keep certain aspects of her life private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. She likens herself to a duck, paddling furiously underwater while appearing calm and graceful on the surface, believing in "Grace Under Fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. She prefers to find her own solutions to struggles rather than portraying herself as a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Chopra's experiences underscore that her [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | ambition]] and [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | purpose]] are fueled by a strong foundation built on the lessons learned from her diverse [[The impact of relationships on personal growth | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

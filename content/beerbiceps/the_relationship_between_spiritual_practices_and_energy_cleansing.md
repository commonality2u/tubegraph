From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The speaker's personal journey highlights how [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual practices]] can be utilized for energy cleansing and overcoming deep-seated fears associated with dark presences or entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:15">[08:22:15]</a>. This journey began with a childhood fear of the dark and an innate sense of a deeper, unseen layer beyond human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Early Experiences with Perceived Dark Entities

From a young age, the speaker felt a constant presence staring at them when alone in dark rooms or corridors within their family home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. This fear of the dark was more than just a lack of light; it was a fear of an entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. They struggled to sleep alone until nearly 20 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Sleep Paralysis and a Haunting Vision

At the age of 11, the speaker experienced frequent sleep paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This scientific phenomenon involves partial awakening during sleep where the brain paralyzes the body, but sometimes dreams or nightmares can blend with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

During these episodes, the speaker would often see a shadowy figure in their room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The most terrifying experience involved feeling shadowy creatures chaining them down to the bed, welcoming a "queen" or "lady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. A woman with pale, torn skin, untidy hair, and one pale red eye then appeared, sitting on their chest, making them feel her weight and fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### The First Application of Spiritual Practice: A Mantra

Growing up in a [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | spiritual family]], the speaker's mother taught them a specific mantra to ward off bad spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. During the terrifying sleep paralysis experience, the speaker closed their eyes and began chanting "Om Namah Shivaya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. They continued chanting until they fell asleep, and upon waking, the entity was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Years later, a National Geographic show depicted a Japanese phenomenon where sleep paralysis is accompanied by a witch-like figure sitting on top of the person, often linked to theories of alien abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. The visual representation in the show was "exactly" what the speaker had seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear and Embracing Spirituality

The speaker eventually overcame their phobia by discovering [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:15">[08:22:15]</a>. [[spiritual_practices_and_their_influence_on_astrology | Spirituality]] not only involves meditation and karma but also discusses the spirit world, astral world, dark energies, and how to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. As mentioned in the *Autobiography of a Yogi*, "when you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The speaker strengthened their "[[spiritual_and_yogic_lifestyle_and_its_impact_on_intuition | spiritual muscle of [their] mind]]" by [[importance_of_spiritual_practices_and_meditation | meditating]] a lot, starting around age 22-23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

### Collective Meditation and Energy Cleansing

The speaker and their co-founder, Rajas, frequently meditated together to promote a positive atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. In one particular night meditation session in a garage within their building, they both sensed a "dark" energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Recalling the mantra from childhood, the speaker chanted "Om Namah Shivaya" while continuing to meditate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. They both felt they "pushed out some kind of a negative energy from that room and from the environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

## Validation and Continued Practice

A psychic friend later visited their office, which was located in the same building as the speaker's childhood home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. The psychic friend immediately identified a specific room — directly beneath where the speaker had their sleep paralysis experience — as having a lot of dark energy, indicating the presence of a "demon or a ghost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. They noted that the ongoing [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | meditation]] had likely pushed this energy out, as "meditation makes the environment more positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

The speaker's grandfather, who had run a hospital on the ground floor of the building since the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, confirmed that patients in those specific rooms had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night or even being pushed off their beds by a "scary looking woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. These accounts were consistent with the speaker's own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

Since the psychic's examination, the building has undergone [[transformation_and_spiritual_practice | spiritual cleansing practices]], including *pujas*, *havans*, and lighting candles, to make the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Fortunately, the negative presence is no longer felt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that their deep embrace of [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spirituality]] stems from these lifelong experiences with darkness, which they learned to face and push out through the positivity generated by their [[spiritual_practices_and_their_influence_on_astrology | spiritual practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. They believe that [[spiritual_practices_and_their_influence_on_astrology | spiritual practices]] are crucial in combating the occult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

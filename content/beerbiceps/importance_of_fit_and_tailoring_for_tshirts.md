Achieving a polished look with a T-shirt largely depends on its fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Beyond just the garment, having a fit body with above-average arms, chest, and back is a fundamental step to looking great in a T-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Key Rules for T-shirt Fit

There are specific guidelines to follow when selecting the perfect T-shirt fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>:

### T-shirt Length
*   **Avoid excessive length**: A T-shirt should not be so long that it covers the entire crotch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid being too short**: When you lift your arms, the T-shirt should not expose any skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It needs to be long enough to cover all skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Ideal length**: The T-shirt should end in the middle of your groin region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Sleeve Length and Fit
*   **Preference for short and tight sleeves**: Opt for sleeves that are short and snug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Tailoring**: If a T-shirt has slightly longer sleeves, consider getting them tailored to be tighter and shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Avoid overly short sleeves**: Do not go so short that it appears you are desperate for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Ideal sleeve length**: Sleeves should just cover your entire shoulder muscle, exposing a significant portion of your tricep and bicep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Torso Fit
*   **Upper vs. Mid Torso**: The T-shirt should be tight in your upper torso region (above the line of your nipples) and looser in your mid-torso (everything below the line of your nipples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Nipple Rule**: Never wear T-shirts so tight that your nipples are visible through the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

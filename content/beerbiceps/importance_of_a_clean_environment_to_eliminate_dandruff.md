Dandruff is considered an infection, which highlights the importance of maintaining a clean environment to prevent its recurrence and spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>. Even when using [[using_antidandruff_and_mild_shampoos | anti-dandruff products]], dandruff can return if the environment remains infested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:83">[02:54:83]</a>.

## Cleaning Personal Items

To effectively tackle dandruff, it's crucial to clean any items that come into regular contact with your scalp:

### Pillowcases
Pillowcases should be cleaned regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:12">[02:52:12]</a>.
To do this, take your pillowcase off the pillow, dip it in an antiseptic solution (an antiseptic soap mixed with water), and leave it in the solution for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:44">[03:02:44]</a>.

### Combs and Brushes
The same cleaning process should be applied to combs and brushes that are regularly used on your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>.

### Headgear and Hair Accessories
All kinds of headgear, including caps, hats, and helmets, should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>.
If you use any kind of hair band or hair clips, these should undergo the same cleaning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:38">[03:27:38]</a>.

In essence, anything that comes into contact with your scalp should be washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:37">[03:31:37]</a>.

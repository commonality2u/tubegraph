Colonel Rajiv Ban, an Indian Army officer, shared his experiences and insights from his combat tenure, particularly in Northeast India, offering a perspective on the region's complex situation, including the [[Indias political landscape | political landscape]] and local dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Initial Deployment and Reality Check in Manipur
Colonel Ban's firsthand combat experience began in 1999, the year he joined his unit in Kar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. His first posting to Manipur with the Assam Rifles provided a stark introduction to the ground realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. At the time, he was the youngest officer posted to Assam Rifles, around 24-25 years old with three years of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Upon landing in Manipur, he encountered a concerning sentiment among civilians who questioned if he was "from India," highlighting the deep-seated animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This environment saw Hindi books, newspapers, and movies absolutely banned, indicating an "unparallel government" run by various groups with significant hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Causes of Animosity
Colonel Ban attributes the severe animosity to several factors:
*   **Lack of awareness** which makes exploitation easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.
*   **Exploitation by anti-social elements** or groups with political interests, especially when people are unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Desire for power and money** among those at the top, leading to corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.
*   **Young people's desire to wield weapons**, feeling powerful with a raw sense of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Nature of Militant Groups
Contrary to external perceptions, Colonel Ban noted that militant groups in Manipur operated with a strong "ethical and moral code of conduct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. He observed that any wrongdoing by a member was publicly acknowledged and apologized for by the leadership in newspapers, with inquiries constituted and decisions published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. They never harmed ladies, children, or elderly people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. Military personnel (officers or jawans) with their families in public places were considered "walking insurance policies," implying they were safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

## Public Interaction and Personal Safety
Colonel Ban learned that treating people with respect, particularly age, gender, and children, ensured one's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. He participated in local dances and attended marriage functions in remote areas at night, sometimes without a weapon, relying on the host's invitation as an "insurance policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. He states that the situation in an area is "as good or bad as you are," which was highly applicable in Northeast India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>.

## Learnings from Manipur
Colonel Ban derived three main insights from his Manipur experience:
1.  **Military Perspective (Assam Rifles):** He realized the Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinels of the Northeast," are an incredibly potent force. Their companies are like "mini-Indias" with people from all regions speaking multiple languages, yet all fluent in Gorkhali (Nepalese), and sharing similar eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. The long tenure of jawans (up to 60 years old) provides immense experience, making them "walking encyclopedias" for local knowledge and combat advice, often negating the need for maps or GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Militant Perspective:** The strong ethical and moral code of conduct observed among the militant groups, especially their respect for civilians and adherence to their own internal justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Civilian Perspective:** The principle that respecting the local populace, especially women, children, and the elderly, ensures safety and positive interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

These experiences in Northeast India provided Colonel Ban with crucial insights into human behavior under conflict and the distinct dynamics of different insurgencies, differentiating them from the [[Kashmir conflict and ground realities | Kashmir conflict and ground realities]] he also experienced.

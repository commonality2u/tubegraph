The emergence of [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] is understood against the backdrop of the powerful Mughal Empire, particularly during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. To fully comprehend [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] mentality, history, and conquests, it is crucial to first understand the state of India and the nature of the Mughals before his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Mughal Empire and Its Rulers

The period preceding [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai's]] birth was characterized by significant fear and suffering for the average Indian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The North of India had suffered numerous invasions and atrocities, with temples looted, people killed, and women and children taken as property or slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This led to a pervasive sense of vulnerability and insecurity among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Mughal Rule and Cruelty

The Mughal Empire, particularly in the North, was vast, encompassing 22 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Mughal emperors, such as Akbar and Salim (later Jahangir), are depicted as cruel rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, contrary to some popular romanticized portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Akbar, for instance, is noted to have killed subordinates for their women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Salim, later Jahangir, brutally tortured and blinded his own son, Khusrau, who was favored by Akbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Khusrau was later killed by Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This history underscores [[the_mughal_empires_rulers_and_their_cruel_tactics | the cruel nature of Mughal rule]] and their internal dynamics.

### Aurangzeb's Ascent to Power

The speaker emphasizes that understanding [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai's]] enemy, Emperor Aurangzeb, is essential to understanding [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Aurangzeb's rise to power was marked by a ruthless [[mughal_succession_wars_and_internal_conflicts | struggle for the throne]], a common legacy within the Mughal family where aspirants had to eliminate rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

Aurangzeb, initially sent to less fertile provinces like Kabul and the Deccan by his father Shah Jahan, gained military experience and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Unlike his brothers, such as Dara Shikoh who was interested in intellectual discussions and philosophy, Aurangzeb was highly skilled in battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. He strategically worked to build his power, even against his father's wishes, by attacking rich Deccan states like Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi to acquire wealth and expand his army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

In the [[mughal_succession_wars_and_internal_conflicts | wars of succession]], Aurangzeb used cunning tactics. He corresponded with his brother Murad, feigning disinterest in the throne and religious piety to secure Murad's allegiance against Dara Shikoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. He successfully defeated his brothers, including Dara Shikoh, who was eventually captured and beheaded under Sharia law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Aurangzeb's own son, Muhammad Sultan, was imprisoned and died of depression at 36, and his brother Murad died from an opium overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Aurangzeb secured the throne by eliminating his kith and kin who could claim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This was a "throne or the grave" scenario for Mughal princes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Military Might and Financial Power

The Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb was at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The empire collected immense wealth, primarily from agriculture, by exploiting cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The empire's earnings from its 22 provinces amounted to approximately 1.2 crore rupees (about 12 million rupees), which in silver coins (10 grams each) was worth about 93,000 kilograms of gold, or roughly 3.5 billion US dollars today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

The Mughal army was formidable in numbers, with nobody able to match their half a million soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. It consisted of heavy-duty cavalrymen, artillerymen, and foot soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Their cavalry had helmets, full armor, javelins, heavy-duty swords, and shields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The army also included a vast logistical train of camels and oxen carrying food, livestock, and luxurious tents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This created an "optical illusion" of overwhelming strength that intimidated rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The Mughals also employed light-weight cannons and explosive experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

The Mansabdars, military men who were granted land and maintained cavalry forces, acted as mini-kings, ruling over 80% of the Mughal Empire and wielding immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. They were often ruthless warriors, creating fear among the local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. The Mughal army was diverse, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turks, and even some Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Racial discrimination was present, with lighter-skinned soldiers from outside India often paid more than Indian Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

## Shivaji Maharaj: Vision Against Power

[[The historical narrative of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] vision was to create his small "Swaraj" (self-rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. This vision stood in stark contrast to the existing power structure of the Mughal Empire, which was rich, militarily superior, and ruled by a ruthless emperor like Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. The very context of [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai's]] life and struggles is defined by the formidable challenge posed by Aurangzeb and his vast empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

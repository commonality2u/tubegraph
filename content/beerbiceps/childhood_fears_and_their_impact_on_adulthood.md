From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The speaker recounts a lifelong struggle with fear, particularly a deep-seated apprehension of the dark and unseen entities, which began in childhood and persisted into adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This fear was distinct from a typical fear of darkness, as it was specifically "the fear of some entity that always stared at me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Genesis of Fear

From a young age, the speaker pondered whether there was a deeper, unseen layer beyond human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Horror movies, which entered his life as a child, seemed to provide an answer to this question, suggesting the existence of unseen forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The speaker grew up in a building that housed a family-owned hospital on the ground floor, with his living quarters on the third floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This environment contributed to his persistent fear of the dark, where he often felt a staring presence when alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This phase lasted longer than typical childhood fears, as he couldn't sleep alone until he was around 19 or 20 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Traumatic Childhood Experience: Sleep Paralysis

At 11 years old, the speaker experienced a terrifying incident while sleeping next to his mother, which he describes as his scariest [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Understanding Sleep Paralysis
[[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | Sleep paralysis]] is a scientific phenomenon where a person half-wakes up during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The brain usually paralyzes the muscular system during sleep to prevent physical reactions to dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. In [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]], individuals open their eyes but cannot move or scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In severe cases, nightmares can merge with reality, making the experience more frightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The speaker's [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] often included seeing a shadowy figure in his room, leading him to close his eyes and hope to fall back asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### The "Witch" Encounter
During this particular incident, he felt shadowy creatures chaining him to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These creatures seemed to welcome a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. A woman with pale, torn skin, blisters, untidy hair, and one visible pale red eye appeared, sitting on his chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. He could feel her weight and fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Despite being paralyzed and unable to scream for his mother, who was sleeping beside him, he remembered a mantra his spiritual mother had taught him to ward off bad spirits: "Om Namah Shivay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He recited it until he fell back asleep, and upon waking, the presence was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Lingering Impact and External Validation

This terrifying experience at age 11 deeply affected the speaker's sleep for the next 7 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### National Geographic Reenactment
Two years later, at age 13, watching a National Geographic show about alien abductions, the speaker encountered a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon related to [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This phenomenon described a witch sitting on top of someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The visual representation of this woman in the show, with a single eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, and pale, dead eyes, was *exactly* what the speaker had seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This discovery profoundly disturbed him, causing him to cry and further solidifying his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Psychic Confirmation and Building History
Years later, a psychic friend visited the speaker's office, located in the same building as his childhood home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The psychic immediately went to a specific room at the end of a corridor, directly below the speaker's childhood bedroom, and stated it had a lot of dark energy, possibly from a demon or ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Upon questioning his grandfather, who had run the hospital since the 1960s, the speaker learned chilling details about that specific part of the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Over 50 years, patients in those recovery rooms had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night, or even being pushed off their beds by a flash of a scary-looking woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This occurred directly under the spot where the speaker had his traumatic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear Through Spirituality

The speaker eventually grew out of his phobia by embracing [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | Spirituality]], he explains, not only involves meditation and positive karma but also addresses the spirit world, astral planes, dark energies, and demons, providing ways to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Quoting *Autobiography of a Yogi*, the speaker highlights the principle:
> "When you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

He applied this by strengthening his "spiritual muscle" through extensive [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | meditation]], beginning around age 22 or 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A notable experience occurred during a late-night [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | meditation]] session with his co-founder, Rajas, in the same building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. They both sensed a dark energy, and by continuing to [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | meditate]] and reciting the "Om Namah Shivay" mantra, they felt they pushed out the negative energy from the room and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This shared experience confirmed their feeling of combating a dark presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Since the psychic's visit and the confirmation of the building's history, various spiritual practices, including pujas, havans, and lighting candles, have been performed in the now-defunct hospital space to positively transform the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The speaker no longer feels a negative presence there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. His deep embrace of [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | spirituality]] is directly linked to his childhood and teenage experiences of constant, deep-seated fear of unseen entities in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. He emphasizes that spiritual practices can help combat occult experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## The Evolution of Work Ethic
In earlier times, there was a widespread romanticization of intense work, often promoting the idea of working 24 hours, doing multiple projects simultaneously, and sacrificing sleep and food for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This narrative suggested that the more a person engaged in such extreme work, the more successful they would become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

However, with more life experience, the speaker realized the profound importance of work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This shift in perspective acknowledges that work does not inherently need to be tough or rough; instead, it can be a companion, creative, and a source of joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Embracing Self-Care for Rejuvenation
A practical example of this [[the_role_of_discipline_and_selfcare_in_personal_and_professional_growth | self-care]] philosophy is taking intentional breaks. During a recent trip to Turks and Caicos, the speaker and her husband turned off their phones, walked on the beach, and collected shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This period of disconnection led to feeling rejuvenated, excited, and re-motivated to advance her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The ability to "switch off" and spend time with family, watch movies, or engage in personal activities is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This deliberate separation from work allows for renewed focus and productivity when returning to professional tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The speaker, who manages approximately six professional verticals, prioritizes this balance, ensuring dedicated time for her family and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Happiness
This shift towards balance has contributed to a greater sense of [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | happiness and calm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The speaker feels happier than she has been in a long time, attributing it to maturity, being over 35, and having a more stable foundation in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. She no longer feels the need to run as fast, instead carefully considering each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Her choices are now her own, not defined by external validation, leading to a comfortable and content state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Managing External Pressures and Opinions
Being a public figure presents unique challenges, as one's life becomes a constant subject of public discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. It's difficult to walk into a room knowing that conversations about you will occur, regardless of whether they are positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that her fame is a byproduct of her job, not her job itself, and it does not define her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

To maintain well-being, it's crucial to manage this external noise. The advice is to focus on those who believe in you and on any "sliver of light" or inspiration, rather than dwelling on negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. This requires pushing through the "baggage" and "shackles" of people trying to hold you down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. Furthermore, it's important to surround oneself only with "champions" and those who are genuinely happy for your success, removing toxic individuals from your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. This approach supports [[balancing_personal_life_and_public_persona | balancing personal life and public persona]].

## Purpose and Legacy
Ultimately, the meaning of life, for the speaker, is [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | having purpose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Success is subjective, and while some may aspire to a simple life, others find purpose in creation and contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. The key is to make choices that bring inner peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This involves taking achievable next steps towards goals, rather than waiting for miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. The speaker aims for her career to be a legacy for her children and future generations, demonstrating potential beyond conventional expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The conversation also touches on [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_and_professional_life | spirituality]], with the speaker expressing belief in destiny, karma, and reincarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Daily prayer and a deep sense of gratitude are central to her life, particularly for her health, family, lifestyle, and the privilege of having agency in her own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. This gratitude inspires her to give back to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

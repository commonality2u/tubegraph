[[Relationships Love and Personal Life | Relationships]] are explored through various lenses, including personal experiences, the role of psychology, and societal expectations for both men and women.

## Foundations of Healthy Relationships

According to Kiara Advani, when two people are together, they should make each other feel important in each other's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This doesn't mean putting someone on a pedestal or making them feel like a queen, which she states would be off-putting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Instead, it implies a relationship of equals, or sometimes a "seesaw" dynamic where one person might need to be "pampered" at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

Key elements for a strong foundation include:
*   **Loyalty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>
*   **Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>
*   **[[importance_of_mutual_respect_and_communication_in_relationships | Mutual Respect]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>: Respect involves accepting people for who they are, rather than trying to change them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_mutual_respect_and_communication_in_relationships | Communication]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>: Open communication is crucial, and ego often gets in the way of healthy interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>: It's important to make the other person feel seen, heard, and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

Kiara Advani states that while people will grow and evolve, they should not do so at the cost of changing who they inherently are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Attempting to change a person fundamentally isn't a true relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Accepting each other for who you are, with both strengths and weaknesses, makes a relationship easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

### Intentions vs. Reactions
Understanding the intention behind a person's behavior, rather than just focusing on their reaction, can reduce disappointment in [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. For example, anger might stem from an inability to express something important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Gendered Expectations and Challenges

### For Women
Female actors may find it difficult to find [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | love]] in their profession due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>:
*   Many men might be afraid to approach them due to their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   Out of those who do approach, many may only be interested in the status of being with a famous person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   This leaves a very small pool of genuine individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   Additionally, men often take longer to grow emotionally, frequently after the age of 30 or 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, making it challenging to date someone as emotionally expressive as an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

Kiara Advani believes women are generally more genuine in relationships and have more limited options compared to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. She feels that societal expectations contribute to women being told they are "good for only getting married" and not for making their own lives, though this is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

### For Men
The host explains that men often face a unique trauma from childhood: their value is frequently attached to the money and fame they earn, leading to feelings of worthlessness if they don't achieve these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This societal pressure can be equally or more intense than pressures faced by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. This often leads men to prioritize professional life until they are "settled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

Men generally expect direct communication in [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | relationships]] due to their own difficulties in communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. They also seek a space for vulnerability and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### Blurring Lines and Partnership
The traditional roles of husband and wife are blurring, with a growing desire for equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Marriage should be seen as a partnership where both individuals can pursue their dreams and mutually support each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. The idea that a woman should only be a "recovery" space for a man is challenged; a partner can only be an "energizer" if they are happy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Personal Insights and Experiences

Kiara Advani admits to being a very transparent person, unable to hide her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She believes she is the same person whether with loved ones, her team, or alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Her emotional quotient is high, allowing her to easily pick up on others' energy and even feel their low moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

She holds a high bar for her own [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | relationships]], influenced by the [[lessons_learned_from_family_and_relationships | loving relationship]] of her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. She is an "all or nothing" person in a relationship, sometimes even making it a bigger priority than her work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. She also believes that one's personal life, whether positive or traumatic, can provide "fuel" to improve as an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The host, as a podcaster, has learned about [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | relationships]] by entering many people's "heads and hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He initially thought he would never marry, wanting to dedicate all his time to his career, but learned that a stable partner is essential for achieving significant career goals as they provide a space for recovery and healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

### Psychology and Personal Growth
Kiara Advani studied psychology and humanities, which interested her, and excelled in understanding people and personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. She realized that everyone possesses a little bit of various psychological conditions, feeling as if she had "every disorder in the book" while studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Her psychology studies also taught her the art of detachment, especially useful after internalizing intense characters like Preeti from *Kabir Singh* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Psychology and "people skills" are considered crucial life skills that should be taught more in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Studying psychology helps one understand situations and people around them, and its relevance to real life is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

A monk advised the host to replace judgment with curiosity to foster personal growth in [[relationships_love_and_personal_life | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. Kiara Advani resonates with this, stating that she is not a judgmental person and instead offers observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. She respects the host's education and his ability to use it in his career and for self-defense, noting his curious rather than judgmental approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

### Overcoming Anxiety
Kiara Advani experiences anxiety before film releases, which she attributes to excitement and nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. However, she has learned that physical symptoms of anxiety (like altered breathing or sweaty palms) are the same as those for excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. By consciously telling her mind that these symptoms are excitement, she can reframe the experience, viewing promotional activities as opportunities to refuel rather than stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

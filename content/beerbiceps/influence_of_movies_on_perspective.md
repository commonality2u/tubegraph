Sudha Murty, a renowned author and philanthropist, has consistently enjoyed movies throughout her life, noting their profound impact beyond mere entertainment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

## Evolution of Perspective on Films

Murty's view of movies evolved with age:
*   **Childhood** Initially, she appreciated the storytelling and songs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
*   **Teenage Years** Films like 'Sangam' offered a glimpse into distant places like Paris and London, which were inaccessible at the time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
*   **Later Life** Her engagement became more analytical, recognizing movies as more than just three hours of entertainment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

## Movies as Agents of Influence

Murty emphasizes that movies hold significant influence, particularly over teenagers in rural areas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> She believes that films should convey positive messages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> Presenting negative content, even in the name of creativity or fun, can lead to the adoption of bad habits among viewers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> Therefore, movie content should prioritize positive societal impact over mere entertainment or profit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> This perspective highlights the [[media_narratives_and_propaganda_influence | influence of media narratives]].

While she listed many romantic films, Murty clarified that her enjoyment stemmed from the broader themes they explored, such as the struggles of a mother or wife, rather than just the romance itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> She highlighted that "life is bigger than romance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>

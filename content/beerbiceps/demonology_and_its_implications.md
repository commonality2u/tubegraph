[[Demonology and its implications | Demonology]] is defined as the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:22">[30:20:22]</a>. According to one paranormal investigator, demons are considered "inhuman spirits" that have never taken a physical birth or walked the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:06">[30:43:06]</a>. This contrasts with "human spirits," which are the souls of people who have died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:41">[30:38:41]</a>.

## Distinguishing Demons from Spirits
Often, what is perceived as demonic possession is not a demon but a human spirit portraying itself as one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:03">[32:01:03]</a>. Human spirits can become "heavy" or aggressive, causing activities no less powerful than demonic activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:36">[41:34:36]</a>. For instance, a spirit in a factory, feeding on high EMF (electromagnetic field) and human energy, caused a machine to chop off workers' hands, an act initially thought to be demonic but later attributed to a powerful spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:27">[42:25:27]</a>.

In contrast, actual demons are believed to be much more powerful, capable of causing greater emotional and physical damage and havoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:06">[32:11:06]</a>. However, based on investigations, cases of genuine demonic possession are rare; many reported incidents are either psychological or involve very active human spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:16">[41:16:16]</a>.

## Origins and Purpose of Demons in Religion
The concept of demons largely originates from religious books and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:34">[32:32:34]</a>. Various religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianism, and Zoroastrianism, have their own depictions of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>. These figures are often perceived as existing to support the concept of "light" or God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:06">[33:03:06]</a>. The idea is that by fearing a darker entity, faith in God becomes stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.

## Perceived Demonic Activities and Psychological Factors
Many supposed cases of [[demonic_possession_and_exorcism | demonic possession]] are often psychological effects or reactions to situations, rather than genuine demonic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30:32">[37:30:32]</a>. For example, a 15-year-old girl believed to be possessed and throwing parents away was found to be suffering from "excited delirium" due to fear of 10th-grade board exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that extreme focus or control can unlock a person's physical limits, similar to a mother's superhuman strength when her child is in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:23">[40:20:23]</a>. Before investigating a suspected demonic possession, it is crucial to review medical reports and consult psychiatrists or psychologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:46">[36:44:46]</a>.

## Influence of Media and [[Cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | Cultural Phenomena]]
Movies and cultural portrayals, such as the "white sari" ghost in Indian horror films, have significantly influenced how people perceive [[paranormal activities and supernatural entities | paranormal activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a>. Many individuals report seeing phenomena directly influenced by horror movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:22">[03:20:22]</a>. The "white sari" concept originated from an ancient belief that a pure soul leaving the body would appear white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. While movies like *The Conjuring* are considered closest to reality in portraying paranormal investigators, they still take creative liberties to induce fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:06">[04:11:06]</a>.

## Serial Killers and Demonic Influence
Some theories link serial killers to [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:29">[26:27:29]</a>. Serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer, Son of Sam, and Ted Bundy are viewed by some as having lost their humanity, becoming "modern world demons" due to their heinous acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. The Son of Sam killer claimed he was commanded to kill by his neighbor's dog, which he believed to be Lucifer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>. Some serial killers have openly discussed their connections to human sacrifices, cults, Satanism, and Satanic rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.

The case of Michael Taylor in 1974 is cited as an example of an event with multiple potential angles:
*   **Schizophrenia**: Michael could have been schizophrenic, and his aggression could have been triggered by mismanaging his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:28:31">[34:28:31]</a>. The lack of open discussion about mental illness in 1974 might have led to misdiagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:02:00">[35:02:00]</a>.
*   **Serial Killer Tendencies**: His inability to hold a job and general instability could suggest inherent criminal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>.
*   **Actual Possession**: It is also considered a possibility that he was truly possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>.

Similarly, the case of Anneliese Michel (basis for *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*) was later found to be manslaughter, as her psychological illness was not properly addressed, and exorcism exacerbated her condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

## Spiritual Protection and [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | Practices]]
Spirits of deceased individuals may remain on Earth for various reasons, including not realizing they are dead, needing attention, wanting revenge, or fearing "Judgment Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This fear of judgment can lead some spirits to remain stuck, especially in places like prisons where criminals fear harsher outcomes in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.

In India, symbols like Om and Swastika are used for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Other protective symbols include the Pentacle, the Eye of Hamsa, and Viking symbols like Thor's hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. Many religions have symbols and practices specifically for protection from [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demonic entities]] and evil spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.

## Positive [[The significance of higher and lower beings in spirituality | Divine Possession]]
Beyond negative entities, there are instances of divine possession, referred to as "Mata Ana phenomena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This occurs when a positive deity possesses an open individual to answer questions or deliver messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. While some instances may be faked, particularly in rural areas where women might seek attention they are otherwise denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>, genuine experiences are also reported, such as witnessing a divine possession at a Durga Temple where positive energy was palpable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>.

## [[Skepticism and belief in the supernatural | Skepticism]] and the Scientific Community
The [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal field]] faces [[skepticism_and_belief_in_the_supernatural | skepticism]] because of numerous fake practitioners who have discredited it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>. A commonly held belief among paranormal investigators is: "no proof is required for a believer, no proof is enough for a non-believer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

The scientific community often disregards paranormal research because phenomena cannot be replicated in a lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. Science tends to focus on fields with direct human application and problems to solve, which the paranormal is not considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>. However, there are physicists who are staunch believers and conduct mind-blowing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

### Investigative Tools and Phenomena
Paranormal investigators use devices like the PSB7, which scans radio frequencies, to communicate with spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. By controlling the speed and direction of scanning, they can isolate genuine responses from random radio broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. Spirits can communicate through "white noise"â€”the static sound found on untuned radios or televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.

An investigation at Hulker Bridge in Pune, one of India's most haunted locations, involved encountering a spirit stuck there since the 11th century, who identified himself as "Shas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. He communicated that he was mummified alive in a box and thrown into a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. English was reportedly spoken in the 11th century, addressing potential skepticism about the language used by an ancient spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>. By telling the spirit it was 2021 and praying for its release, the team believed they helped him cross over, as communication ceased thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

Another investigation in an abandoned church in Nainital revealed entities that were not human, possibly demonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Using the Estess experiment, an investigator was blindfolded and wore noise-canceling headphones to hear white noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:27">[01:51:27]</a>. During this, sounds of a guitar and harmony were reported, followed by a loud thud in a physical room, indicating the presence of entities scared of the "demons outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>.

## Energy, Meditation, and Crystals
The human body possesses electricity, evident in the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>. Practices like Tai Chi can help individuals feel and manipulate the energy field around their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>. When many people pray together in one room, the collective electricity or energy can become stuck in the space, which EMF devices can measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>. Temples and churches, even abandoned ones, retain high EMF readings from years of concentrated prayer and positive energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[48:48:00]</a>.

Meditation is highlighted as a powerful tool for self-protection and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It allows individuals to realize the reality of both negative and highly positive spiritual phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. The human mind and body are capable of immense growth and strength, which can explain many seemingly unexplainable occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

Crystals are also considered powerful tools for healing, protection, and shielding against negative spirits and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. They absorb negativity and need to be regularly charged using natural energies like moonlight or sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Meditating with intention can also activate and charge crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. Crystals possess their own intelligence and can fluctuate based on human energy, demonstrating the life force or "Chi" that can affect objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

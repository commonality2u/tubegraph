Looking handsome extends beyond physical appearance and includes the perception of overall cleanliness and tidiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. An often-overlooked aspect of this perception is a man's scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Role of Fragrances

Fragrances and smells are a significant factor in a man's overall appeal and how he is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This is primarily because women tend to associate an individual with the way they smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. For this reason, especially in first encounters and impressions, it's beneficial to apply a small amount of perfume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Focus is a key determinant of [[importance_of_focus_for_success | success]], whether in academic pursuits, college, or professional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Individuals who achieve success are often those who can maintain maximum focus within minimal work minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To enhance focus, it is crucial to understand what disrupts it, including life's pains, insecurities, performance pressure, and anxiety about the future, all of which contribute to feeling "ungrounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The more grounded one is, the greater their ability to stay focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. One significant factor in improving groundedness, and thus focus, is nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Choose the Correct Food

The human body is fundamentally a "collection of everything you eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Our evolutionary history as cavemen involved centuries of consuming clean, fresh food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, eating habits have drastically changed over the last 100 to 200 years, leading to the consumption of "packaged poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

A diet rich in additives and processed sugar can make an individual feel less grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Conversely, making wise food choices and prioritizing fresh food can lead to a noticeable positive change in one's mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

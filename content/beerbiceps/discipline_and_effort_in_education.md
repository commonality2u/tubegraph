While many seek [[exam_motivation_and_hunger_for_success | exam motivation]], a fundamental truth is that no student genuinely enjoys the process of studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Most would prefer leisure activities like watching television or playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, studying is a constant in life that cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. What *can* be changed is one's perspective towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Studying as a Boxing Match

Instead of viewing studying as a boring obligation, consider it a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali famously stated that he "hated every single minute of training," but he told himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This perspective applies directly to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### The True Opponent

Unlike a boxer facing external competitors, your biggest opponent in studying and in life is yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Students who excel in exams dislike studying as much as anyone else, but they possess a greater "hunger for success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This internal drive, not superior intelligence or talent, is the key to [[exam_motivation_and_hunger_for_success | exam motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Purpose of Effort

Effort in education should be directed towards a singular goal: your future self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Avoid [[exam_motivation_and_hunger_for_success | studying]] to impress parents or friends, or for external rewards like high marks or future pay packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

By training diligently, you can reach a point where you are confident in your knowledge, knowing you will perform like a heavyweight champion regardless of the questions asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Choosing the Harder Path

It's easy to skip difficult sections or questions, especially if friends are doing the same and you're prepared enough to merely pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. However, it's crucial to ask yourself: "Do you just want to pass or do you want to place yourself in the best position for your future?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> Always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

> Discipline is defined as choosing between what you want now and what you want the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

In moments of laziness, when presented with the option of giving less than your 100%, choose to give 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This extra effort and motivation should come from deep within yourself, not for external validation, but solely for your own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Ultimately, you have a choice: be remembered as an average individual who lost battles against their own limitations, or as someone who achieved greatness in their [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studies]] and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The guiding principle for success is "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

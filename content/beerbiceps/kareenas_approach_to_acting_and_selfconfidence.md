Kareena Kapoor Khan identifies confidence as her biggest asset, which she believes has inspired people through her characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. She feels she can only truly act to play her characters and doesn't believe she can "act" in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Her confidence, she states, is not something that can be faked; it's either present or not, and she doesn't recall a time without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Passion for the Craft
Having been on set since the age of 17, and now at 43, Kareena reflects on her career with deep satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. She considers herself lucky to have genuinely enjoyed every minute of her time in front of the camera, meeting actors and directors, and playing diverse [[roles_and_challenges_in_kareenas_film_career | roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This enjoyment has been a constant throughout her journey, even before she first faced the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. She describes acting as an "intoxication" or a "trance" that she experiences every time she is in front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## The Art of Performance
Kareena believes that the best acting and art originate from a deeper place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While she makes many things appear effortless, she explains that some [[roles_and_challenges_in_kareenas_film_career | roles]] require her to delve "extremely deep" within herself to deliver a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. She finds "grey" characters, those with complex moral ambiguities, the most interesting to portray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

She cites roles like Rupa in *Laal Singh Chaddha*, *Heroine*, and *Tashan* as examples of characters she invested deeply in, even if they weren't always box office successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Rupa, in particular, intrigued her because she was "dark but yet like a ray of sunshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Empathy is also a crucial aspect of performance for her, enabling an actor to connect with and convey the emotions of other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Evolution of Ambition and Mindset
Comparing herself to her 20s, Kareena notes a significant shift in her ambition and mindset. In her earlier years, she was driven by a "hunger to be the best," constantly striving for success and box office hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. However, after nearly 25 years in her [[kareena_kapoor_khans_reflections_on_her_career | career]], she now seeks a "different kind of hunger" – one for peace and deeper understanding in the characters she plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

This change is attributed to her personal growth as a human being between the ages of 20 and 43, particularly the impact of [[the_impact_of_motherhood_and_family_on_kareenas_life | motherhood]] and being a wife, which brought new responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. She no longer chases success as the sole objective; instead, her mind has expanded, and she credits her husband and children for helping her evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. She feels content and at peace, prioritizing her mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### Influence of Family
Kareena's strong sense of self and confidence is deeply rooted in her upbringing, particularly influenced by her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Her mother, being very "self-made" and a "strongest woman," instilled in her the importance of work and doing the "right things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. The Kapoor family was primarily "art-oriented," with a passion for cinema and music, fostering a relaxed environment without the "show baazi" or media uproar of today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Self-Confidence and Public Image
Kareena openly displays her emotions, stating that if she's in a bad mood, upset, or extra happy, it's visible in her eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. She describes herself as a "reactive person," which she believes aids her acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. She doesn't harbor insecurities related to her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

She doesn't allow social media to affect her sense of self, stating that she doesn't compare herself to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
> "I don't think there is any one you compare yourself with there nothing people compare them sales to you know nothing like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>

## Coping with Challenges and Industry Demands
Kareena acknowledges the profound demands of her profession. She has experienced times when she had to perform despite being "dying of fever" or going through personal difficulties, as there's "no room to have a bad day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. The need to maintain a "perfect star" image in public, regardless of internal struggles, is a significant part of the price actors pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. She considers this single-minded focus on the craft, even when personal tragedies occur, to be "selfish" but necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.

She distinguishes between the demanding nature of the craft itself, which requires 200% effort, and the "unnecessary" pressures of events and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

Despite the numerous [[acting_career_challenges | challenges]] and failures she has faced, including a "string of films that haven't worked," Kareena emphasizes that she never let the audience feel her struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. She learned from these setbacks, using them to reassess her choices and wait for the right script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. She admits to crying herself to sleep over film failures, but ultimately feels her failures have been as formative as her successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

## The Enduring Drive
Even at this stage of her [[kareena_kapoor_khans_reflections_on_her_career | career]], Kareena maintains a deep "hunger" for more, despite being at peace with herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. This ongoing drive to improve scenes and constantly strive is what keeps her engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. She clarifies that this ambition is for her own satisfaction and happiness, to "prove myself to you" – meaning, to her own internal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

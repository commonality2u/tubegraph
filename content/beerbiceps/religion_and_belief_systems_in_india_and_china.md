## Religion in India

India is described as a "religion mixed country," known for its "colorful" religious landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>. Unlike countries that predominantly adhere to a single religion, India embraces multiple faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is seen attending various religious festivals, which symbolizes the government's acknowledgement and care for the diverse populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

The term "Hinduism" was given by Britishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>.
*   **Concept of God:** Adherents believe in one ultimate God, "Parah Pariva Par Vishnu," which is an energy connecting all beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

    *   **Shaktism:** Believes the main God is a woman, a mother figure who gave birth to the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:04">[04:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Karma:** [[hinduism_and_ancient_scriptures | Hinduism]] allows individuals to choose their path, and even atheism is permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. The fundamental principle is [[Spiritual beliefs and practices in India | Karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddhism]]
Traditionally, there was rivalry between [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddhism]] and [[hinduism_and_ancient_scriptures | Hinduism]], but today there is significant love, peace, and friendship, with [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddhism]] often viewed as the essence of [[hinduism_and_ancient_scriptures | Hinduism]] due to shared teachings of being a good person, meditating, praying, and evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

*   **Gautam Buddha:** He was a prince in India who left his kingdom upon realizing the impermanence of life, meditated, became enlightened, and began teaching people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Dalai Lama and Tibet:** The spiritual leader of Tibetan [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddhism]], the Dalai Lama, resides in Himachal Pradesh, India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Indian media portrays that the Chinese government attempted to kill him as a child, leading to his escape to India with followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. It's also reported that the Penang Lama, another spiritual successor, was kidnapped by the Chinese government, and the current leader in Tibet is not recognized as the true one by Tibetans in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Religion in China

China, while not having a single majority religion, primarily sees people believing in [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The younger generation in China often identifies as having no religion, but they are taught values similar to those found in religions, such as [[Spiritual beliefs and practices in India | Karma]], kindness, and helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### [[buddhism_and_deities | Buddhism]] and Cultural Stories
The story of "Journey to the West" is a well-known narrative in China, a movie version of which is watched by almost every Chinese child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

*   **Journey to the West Narrative:** The story centers on a naughty monkey named Wukong, born from a rock, who caused chaos in heaven by eating peaches that grant long life. He was punished by being trapped under a mountain, awaiting salvation by a monk named Tang Sanang (or Xuanzang). Tang Sanang's mission is to journey from China to "Tenu" (India), considered a holy land, to obtain the "Buddha Bible" (Jing) to save the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Along the way, Tang Sanang and his three bodyguards—Wukong, a pig, and a master from the ocean—encounter various monsters who seek to eat Tang Sanang's flesh for immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The story concludes with them successfully acquiring the scriptures and becoming enlightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Black Myth: Wukong:** A popular video game, "Black Myth: Wukong," is based on the monkey character, Wukong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural Similarities:** There is an ongoing debate in Chinese media about whether the "Black Myth: Wukong" game, or its underlying story, originates from [[cultural_similarities_and_differences_between_india_and_china | India]] or China, with both sides claiming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. The story of Wukong is from Buddhist origins in China, while Hanuman is from [[hinduism_and_ancient_scriptures | Hinduism]] in India, indicating distinct origins despite some similar elements in their great monkey character folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Tibet and Religious Diversity in China
Tibet is considered a part of China by normal Chinese citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. China is a multicultural country with 56 different ethnic groups and regions, including Muslims, and people who resemble Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Xinjiang people, for example, have a different language with Arabic-like writing, and some Mongolian regions have a unique vertical writing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Despite these differences, Chinese citizens visiting Tibet show respect for the local religion, and locals provide food and accommodation, fostering a sense of shared family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. The Chinese government provides free medication and nine years of free education for all citizens, including those in Tibet and other regions, who learn Mandarin at school but can also learn their mother tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

While international media sometimes portrays China as atheist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, the speaker clarifies that Chinese people are taught to believe in [[Spiritual beliefs and practices in India | Karma]] and self-reliance to improve their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

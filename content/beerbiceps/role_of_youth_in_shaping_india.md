The youth of India are seen as the driving force for the nation's future, embodying a new era of dynamism and global ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This generation is encouraged to watch and learn from leaders to gain guidance for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Faces of Young India

Dr. S. Jaishankar, the Minister of External Affairs, is presented as a face of young India, alongside figures like Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. His assertive responses on the global stage resonate with the youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The growth of women's sports leagues, exemplified by players like Jemimah Rodrigues, is also highlighted as an emerging activity that symbolizes this new energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Message to the Youth

For young people, especially entrepreneurs, the core message is to focus on personal and national excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This involves:
*   **Self-Belief**: Recognizing that the opportunities and possibilities of the current era are vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Creating Employment**: Prioritizing job creation as a key driver for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Increasing Exports**: Contributing to the nation's economic strength by boosting exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Building Strengths**: Focusing on fundamental competitiveness, which includes strengthening industries, entrepreneurship, startups, agriculture, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Concepts like "Make in India," "Startup India," and "Gati Shakti" are central to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Embracing Global Opportunities**: Viewing the world as a "global workplace" where career opportunities are not limited by geographical borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This includes roles in merchant shipping, air travel, blue-collar jobs, and various professional fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

## Redefining Brain Drain and Mobility

The traditional concept of "brain drain" is being redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Instead, the world is seen as a "membrane" allowing movement in and out, with people frequently working abroad and returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. The idea that leaving India means never returning is no longer the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. There is a growing demand for "trusted talent" â€“ skilled and talented individuals who adhere to international business systems and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This shift is leading to mobility agreements with countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and the US, facilitating global talent flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

The rise of technology, such as AI and quantum computing, further enables a global workplace where individuals can work for international employers without leaving India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. There is a growing belief that opportunities within India can now be as good as, or even better than, those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. The increased interest of global companies like Apple in manufacturing in India, and Indian companies investing more domestically, are indicators of this positive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

## Leadership and Influence

Youth are encouraged to pursue what they truly enjoy, as this leads to excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Leadership is not solely tied to age or experience; it can emerge from young individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. The influence of "early thought leaders" and content creators, such as YouTubers, is acknowledged as significant in shaping public discourse and influencing large audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

Dr. Jaishankar emphasizes the importance of aligning personal and national choices: "a good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. The current era presents immense opportunities for the youth, and it is the obligation of leaders to "open that up as much to prepare it as much to create that kind of favorable ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

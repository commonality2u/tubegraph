While being born into a wealthy family might seem advantageous, it presents its own unique set of challenges, particularly in fostering independence, humility, and a true understanding of hard work. The Chanchlani family's experience offers insights into navigating these dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Sheltered" Trap

A common concern for wealthy families is the risk of their children becoming "sheltered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This often manifests as children being driven everywhere, having everything easily provided, and lacking exposure to the realities of earning a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Ashish Chanchlani's father actively sought to counter this by having Ashish work with him from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

> "What happens is that many rich kids are sheltered. He was working with me right from the age of 16 to 17." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>
>
> "Many rich kids are sheltered, then the driver drops them off, the driver picks them up, they get everything easy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

Ashish's early experiences, including working in multiplexes and going to the bank daily to deposit cash, significantly shaped his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, preventing him from becoming solely reliant on his family's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He was even responsible for suggesting and implementing high technology like 3D and Dolby 7.1 sound in the family's multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Instilling Values: Humility and the Hunger for Success

The Chanchlani family emphasized that [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | success is more important than money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This value was inculcated in Ashish and Muskan since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The family believes that true success lies in remaining humble even after achieving fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> "He had inculcated in him since childhood that success is more important than money and the hunger for success makes you feel sorry for him." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

The family's emphasis on humility is evident in how Ashish and Muskan treat everyone equally, from their cook to their watchman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They were taught to understand that fame and money are fleeting; what matters is the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Their father, for example, used the fluctuating popularity of film stars like Aamir Khan to illustrate that sustained [[the_influence_of_family_dynamics_on_success | success]] comes from effort, not just celebrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Cultivating Independent Identity

Despite coming from a successful family, Ashish never wanted to flaunt his family's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He learned from his father, who, despite being the son of a "big man" (his grandfather), still felt the pressure to create his own identity and stand on his own feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

> "I never wanted to show off my money by going out and saying that I am the son of a big father." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>
>
> "I wanted to be on my own feet, independent, earn on my own self and have my own identity so creating my own identity is what I learnt from him." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>

This desire for an independent identity is a significant challenge for children of wealthy families, as the path of least resistance might be to rely on inherited resources. The Chanchlanis actively encouraged their children to carve out their own paths, leading to their success in the digital space.

## Encouraging Freedom and Passion

Ashish's parents supported his passion for acting even when it seemed unconventional, allowing him to pursue his vine channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While they encouraged him to finish his studies, they allowed him the freedom to explore his creative pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

> "Whatever the child wants to do, first let him do it. First, see to it, at least give him one year. At least if he is able to do it for one year, then see to it how successful he is in that. Whether he becomes successful even at 50, then let him move on. Don't stop him. Don't restrict him in anything. Let him fly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

The family's philosophy is to "let him fly," believing that children should not be overly restricted, as it can lead to confusion about their life's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This approach highlights the importance of providing a nurturing environment that balances support with the freedom to explore one's passions and ultimately find their own version of success.

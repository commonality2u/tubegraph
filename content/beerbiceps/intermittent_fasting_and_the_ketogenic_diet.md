When considering weight loss, two prominent dietary protocols that offer rapid results are the [[Introduction to the Ketogenic Diet | Ketogenic Diet]] and [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | Intermittent Fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[02:38]</a>. These methods are considered more advanced and require more sacrifices compared to simpler weight loss approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[02:38]</a>. The choice of which method to adopt depends on an individual's mental state and their readiness to make sacrifices for rapid weight loss versus a slower, steadier approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>.

## The Ketogenic Diet (Keto)

The [[Introduction to the Ketogenic Diet | ketogenic diet]] is an effective weight loss strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15">[08:15]</a>. It is characterized as a very low carbohydrate diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>.

Key characteristics of the [[Introduction to the Ketogenic Diet | Ketogenic Diet]] include:
*   **Net Carbs:** Net carbohydrates should not exceed 20 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">[08:36]</a>.
*   **Carb Sources:** The primary sources of carbohydrates are vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>.
*   **Strict Keto:** In a strict [[Different Types of Ketogenic Diets | ketogenic diet]], vegetable choices are limited to green leafy vegetables, excluding options like carrots or beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48">[08:48]</a>.

The [[Pros and cons of the ketogenic diet | keto diet]] can be life-changing and lead to very rapid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>. For some, it can result in significant transformations in as little as two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>.

## Intermittent Fasting (IF)

[[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | Intermittent fasting]] is another protocol for weight loss, offering an alternative to low-carb diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>. Further details on [[Science of intermittent fasting and its benefits | the science of intermittent fasting and its benefits]] and a specific IF diet plan are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>.

## Combining Intermittent Fasting and the Ketogenic Diet

For those seeking extremely rapid weight loss, such as losing 5 kgs in a week, combining [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | intermittent fasting]] with the [[Introduction to the Ketogenic Diet | ketogenic diet]] is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>. Both [[Introduction to the Ketogenic Diet | keto]] and [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | intermittent fasting]] protocols individually accelerate the rate of weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50">[09:50]</a>.

It is considered safe to combine these two protocols to achieve a very fast rate of weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54">[09:54]</a>. However, it is crucial to remember that this combined approach is a very difficult protocol to follow due to the stringent rules of both diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07">[10:07]</a>.

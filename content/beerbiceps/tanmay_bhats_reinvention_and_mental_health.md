Tanmay Bhat, a prominent figure in the Indian media industry, has undergone significant personal and professional reinvention, particularly concerning his [[mental_health_and_lifestyle | mental health]] and approach to life. His journey includes battles with fitness, the dissolution of AIB (All India Bakchod), and a profound period of self-discovery that reshaped his perspective on success, self-worth, and happiness.

## Early Life and Motivation
Tanmay's early life saw him fund his startup by personal coaching clients, including Ranveer Allahbadia, on their [[tanmay_bhats_weight_loss_journey | weight loss journeys]] [00:00:10] [00:00:13] [00:00:15]. In return, Tanmay mentored Ranveer in the initial phase of his media career [00:00:19] [00:01:11]. This reciprocal relationship involved Ranveer training Tanmay to be physically fit and Tanmay training Ranveer to be a media professional [00:01:08] [00:01:11]. Tanmay recalls Ranveer waking him up aggressively for training sessions [00:01:44] [00:01:58].

His drive for success stemmed from childhood insecurities, particularly around his appearance [00:07:03]. As a "fat kid" [00:07:09], he sought to own intellectual achievements, first through studies, then extracurriculars, then through media and making money [00:07:13] [00:07:15] [00:07:22] [00:07:23] [00:07:28] [00:07:33] [00:07:34]. The pursuit of audience laughter provided immediate gratification and attention [00:07:47] [00:07:49]. He admits that his intense "hustle" was often a way to fill a void and should not necessarily be seen as a positive thing when it means sacrificing everything else [00:07:54] [00:07:57] [00:08:10] [00:08:13] [00:08:15].

## The Darkest Phase: AIB's Disintegration
Tanmay describes three of the worst moments of his life:
1.  Receiving 65% on his 12th standard results after scoring 90% in 10th grade, leading him to binge eat and cry [00:10:21] [00:10:26] [00:10:30] [00:10:46] [00:10:48] [00:10:50] [00:11:04].
2.  His parents sobbing after the Sachin controversy, asking him to quit comedy, especially after his father had a bypass following the Roast incident [00:11:23] [00:11:26] [00:11:29] [00:11:31] [00:11:33] [00:11:35] [00:11:39].
3.  Letting go of all AIB employees last year, a moment where he broke down in front of them [00:11:47] [00:11:49] [00:11:50] [00:11:53] [00:11:57] [00:11:59]. This was the "darkest" of the three moments [00:12:28] [00:16:28].

The dissolution of AIB led him to question his entire life, as he had spent 10 years building the company and working with its people [00:16:45] [00:16:47] [00:16:51] [00:16:53] [00:16:55] [00:16:58]. For a couple of months, he had no office or purpose, spending his days eating and sleeping [00:16:59] [00:17:00] [00:17:02] [00:17:04] [00:17:08] [00:17:11] [00:17:13] [00:17:15]. This period, though dark, was also "revelatory" and "enlightening," as he realized his self-worth was not solely tied to his work [00:17:20] [00:17:22] [00:17:24] [00:17:28] [00:17:30] [00:17:37] [00:17:39]. He had a "personal reinvention," understanding he was still a person capable of doing things [00:17:47] [00:17:48] [00:17:51] [00:17:53] [00:17:56].

Financially, AIB faced severe debt after brands disappeared overnight and it wasn't a funded company [00:14:11] [00:14:14] [00:14:17] [00:14:20]. They lost money on shot but unreleased projects, including a movie and an Amazon show [00:14:43] [00:14:45] [00:14:48] [00:14:51] [00:14:55] [00:14:57] [00:14:58]. Despite the debt, former employees started their own companies and even helped repay some of AIB's debt, demonstrating a positive outcome from the difficult situation [00:13:37] [00:13:41] [00:14:01] [00:14:04] [00:14:05] [00:14:07] [00:14:09].

## Reinvention in Bangalore
After being diagnosed with [[emotional_awareness_and_mental_health | clinical depression]] in December, Tanmay moved to Bangalore to escape the Mumbai media world, where he felt surrounded by reminders of his past life [00:27:52] [00:27:53] [00:27:55] [00:27:57] [00:27:59] [00:28:01]. His friend, Kunal Shah, encouraged him to surround himself with entrepreneurs outside his domain and turn his sadness into fuel for growth [00:28:06] [00:28:07] [00:28:10] [00:28:14] [00:28:17] [00:28:20].

In Bangalore, Tanmay consulted for companies, developed tech ideas, and connected with entrepreneurs in a collaborative "wealth game" rather than Bombay's "status games" [00:28:33] [00:28:35] [00:28:45] [00:28:47] [00:28:50] [00:28:51] [00:28:53] [00:30:02] [00:30:04] [00:30:06] [00:30:08] [00:30:10] [00:30:12] [00:30:15] [00:30:17] [00:30:19] [00:30:23] [00:30:25]. He was even ready to quit the media industry [00:29:07]. This environment, which he describes as optimistic and a spiritual capital, helped him realize that his unconventional background in media was a strength, leading to the realization that he could get up again [00:29:16] [00:29:21] [00:29:22] [00:29:24] [00:29:28] [00:29:30] [00:29:34] [00:29:42] [00:29:44] [00:29:47] [00:29:52] [00:31:32] [00:31:34] [00:31:36] [00:31:39] [00:31:40] [00:31:43] [00:31:47] [00:31:49] [00:30:27] [00:30:29].

## Lessons Learned and New Outlook
Tanmay is now immensely happy, especially after hitting "rock bottom" and rediscovering enthusiasm for life [00:04:25] [00:04:27] [00:04:29] [00:04:32] [00:04:36]. He believes that happiness is not about possessions [00:04:44]. However, he still fears repeating past mistakes, such as not making time for himself and tying his self-worth to work [00:04:50] [00:04:53] [00:04:55] [00:04:56] [00:05:00]. He questions why society measures success primarily by career and financial achievements rather than happiness or personal relationships [00:05:08] [00:05:11] [00:05:13] [00:05:18] [00:05:22] [00:05:24] [00:05:26] [00:05:29] [00:05:35] [00:05:38] [00:05:39] [00:05:41] [00:05:43].

He now understands that the "meaning of life is whatever you want the meaning to be" [00:03:38] [00:03:40] [00:09:00]. He focuses on creating goals that help him achieve "flow," a state where challenge meets skill [00:09:09] [00:09:11] [00:09:13] [00:09:20] [00:09:22] [00:09:25] [00:09:39] [00:09:41] [00:09:43].

**Leadership and Insecurity:**
Reflecting on his leadership at AIB, Tanmay acknowledges that he should have hired a CEO to focus solely on running the company, as his artistic brain impaired his judgment and prioritization [00:21:39] [00:21:41] [00:21:44] [00:21:47] [00:21:49] [00:22:00] [00:22:07] [00:22:08] [00:22:10]. He admits he was an insecure leader, which manifested in ways that did not serve his employees [00:22:42] [00:22:44] [00:22:47] [00:22:51] [00:22:55] [00:22:58] [00:23:00] [00:23:02]. He believes that true leaders bring out the best in people and are secure in themselves [00:23:08] [00:23:10] [00:23:12] [00:23:14] [00:23:15] [00:23:38] [00:23:40]. He now views cruelty in managers as a compensation for their own insecurity [00:23:56] [00:23:58] [00:24:00] [00:24:03] [00:24:06] [00:24:07] [00:24:10] [00:24:12] [00:24:13]. He is now "a lot more secure" and accepts his own flaws [00:36:27] [00:36:29] [00:36:31] [00:36:33] [00:36:36].

**Dealing with Public Perception:**
Having been in the news for five years, Tanmay learned that news often prioritizes views over truth, which is complex and nuanced [00:18:32] [00:18:35] [00:18:37] [00:18:38] [00:18:41] [00:18:42] [00:18:47] [00:18:49] [00:18:51] [00:18:54] [00:18:56]. He advises people not to consume all news as absolute truth and to use their own brains, as judging others based on incomplete information is unhealthy and impairs judgment [00:19:33] [00:19:35] [00:19:37] [00:19:39] [00:19:41] [00:19:44] [00:19:45] [00:20:36] [00:20:38] [00:20:40] [00:20:43] [00:20:46]. He believes that people who are least accepting of others' flaws are often unaware of their own, and high empathy comes with self-awareness [00:20:50] [00:20:53] [00:20:56] [00:20:59] [00:21:02] [00:21:04] [00:21:08] [00:21:10] [00:21:12] [00:21:14] [00:21:16] [00:21:18] [00:21:20] [00:21:21] [00:21:24]. He now feels sadness rather than anger towards those who spread negativity [00:44:55] [00:44:59].

## [[mental_health_and_coping_mechanisms | Mental Health and Coping Mechanisms]]
Tanmay is now a lot more positive, though he admits his comedian background often makes him cynical [00:36:34] [00:36:38] [00:36:40] [00:36:42] [00:36:44] [00:36:45]. He believes positivity is crucial for overcoming bad situations, while negativity achieves nothing [00:37:03] [00:37:04] [00:37:06] [00:37:07].

**Therapy and Self-Awareness:**
His [[the_role_of_therapy_and_mental_health | intensive therapy]] over the last year has significantly increased his [[emotional_awareness_and_mental_health | self-awareness]] [00:32:05] [00:32:07] [00:32:09] [00:32:11]. He realized his excessive dependence on external validation, an "illness" common among social media influencers [00:32:13] [00:32:15] [00:32:17] [00:32:18] [00:32:21]. Therapy is like "going to the gym for your head," helping to reorganize thoughts and provide an objective perspective that friends cannot offer due to their emotional involvement [00:46:27] [00:46:30] [00:46:32] [00:46:34] [00:46:42] [00:46:45] [00:46:47] [00:46:50] [00:46:52] [00:46:54] [00:46:56] [00:46:57] [00:46:59] [00:47:00] [00:47:03] [00:47:06] [00:47:09] [00:47:12] [00:47:14] [00:47:15] [00:47:19] [00:47:21] [00:47:23] [00:47:25] [00:47:28].

**Meditation and Patience:**
He uses Headspace for meditation, recognizing it as crucial "no stimulation time" for observing thoughts [00:47:44] [00:47:46] [00:47:48] [00:47:51] [00:47:55] [00:47:57] [00:48:01] [00:48:03] [00:48:06] [00:48:08]. He believes that as a generation, people have forgotten how to simply sit quietly [00:48:12] [00:48:15] [00:48:18].

A significant spiritual change has been learning patience [00:32:33] [00:32:35] [00:32:39] [00:32:41] [00:32:43]. He recognizes that life is long and there's no need to rush for everything to happen immediately [00:32:46] [00:32:48] [00:32:50] [00:33:13] [00:33:20] [00:33:22] [00:33:24] [00:33:26]. He stresses the importance of playing long-term games, rather than short-term ones often encouraged by social media [00:33:37] [00:33:39] [00:33:41].

## [[tanmay_bhats_weight_loss_journey | Weight Loss Journey]] and Health
Tanmay's most severe health crisis occurred after the AIB Roast, where he weighed 245 kilos and suffered from acute sleep apnea [00:49:00] [00:49:02] [00:49:04] [00:49:07]. His weight led to insufficient oxygen reaching his brain during sleep, causing seizures and waking him four times a night [00:49:09] [00:49:12] [00:49:13] [00:49:15] [00:49:22]. During a medical procedure, his neck muscles collapsed, and he stopped breathing, leading to a temporary death and six days in the ICU [00:49:33] [00:49:35] [00:49:37] [00:49:42] [00:49:45] [00:49:53] [00:49:56] [00:49:59] [00:50:00] [00:50:17] [00:50:19]. This incident served as a wake-up call to get his life in order [00:50:24] [00:50:25] [00:50:29].

His past eating habits were characterized by non-stop consumption from restaurants, with every meal being a "buffet meal" and no concept of breakfast, lunch, or dinner [00:52:05] [00:52:07] [00:52:09] [00:52:21] [00:52:24] [00:52:26] [00:52:29] [00:52:31] [00:52:32] [00:52:34] [00:52:36] [00:52:39]. He would eat his stress and anxiety away, often out of boredom or indiscipline [00:52:52] [00:52:54] [00:52:59] [00:59:02] [00:59:04] [00:59:05] [00:59:08]. He describes a subconscious habit of opening the fridge without purpose, simply to find something to eat [00:53:35] [00:53:37] [00:53:39] [00:53:40] [00:53:42] [00:53:44] [00:53:45] [00:53:47] [00:53:49] [00:53:51]. Smoking also served as an "oral fixation" [00:53:54] [00:53:57].

Currently, his relationship with food is improving, marked by a shift from binge-cheating on diets to maintaining a normal meal even when "cheating" [00:54:00] [00:54:03] [00:54:06] [00:54:07] [00:54:10] [00:54:12] [00:54:14] [00:54:18] [00:54:21] [00:54:24] [00:54:25] [00:54:28] [00:54:31] [00:54:33] [00:54:36] [00:54:38] [00:54:40] [00:54:43]. He has dropped 8 kilos in 2.5 months through diet and daily walking, opting for a slow, steady marathon approach over intense sprints to avoid burnout [00:41:30] [00:41:32] [00:41:34] [00:41:38] [00:41:41] [00:41:45] [00:41:46] [00:41:49] [00:41:50] [00:41:52] [00:41:53] [00:41:56] [00:41:58] [00:42:00] [00:42:04] [00:42:50] [00:42:52] [00:42:54] [00:42:56] [00:42:58] [00:42:59] [00:55:54] [00:55:56] [00:55:59] [00:56:01]. He also plays badminton two to three times a week for cardio [00:55:21] [00:55:22] [00:55:23] [00:55:32] [00:55:34].

## Childhood Trauma and Bullying
Tanmay emphasizes that overweight adults often haven't processed the trauma of childhood bullying [00:56:50] [00:56:52] [00:56:54]. He recalls suppressed memories of slum kids pulling his pants down and taunting him about his body [00:56:56] [00:56:58] [00:57:00] [00:57:03] [00:57:04] [00:57:06] [00:57:08] [00:57:10] [00:57:12] [00:57:14] [00:57:16] [00:57:18]. This unprocessed trauma can lead individuals to believe they don't deserve happiness, potentially manifesting in a body that resists weight loss [00:57:21] [00:57:23] [00:57:25] [00:57:28] [00:57:30] [00:59:15] [00:59:19] [00:59:22] [00:59:24] [00:59:26] [00:59:29] [00:59:30] [00:59:33] [00:59:36] [00:59:37] [00:59:39] [00:59:41] [00:59:43] [00:59:44] [00:59:47].

He encourages overweight children to cry out and vent, as men often lack the skills to handle or express their emotions due to societal expectations [00:57:34] [00:57:36] [00:57:38] [00:57:40] [00:57:41] [00:57:43] [00:57:46] [00:57:49] [00:57:52] [00:57:54] [00:57:56]. Losing weight, he observes, is not just a physical exercise but also a painful mental one, requiring mastery over the brain and emotional processing [00:58:45] [00:58:48] [00:58:50] [00:58:53] [00:58:55] [00:59:10] [00:59:12] [00:59:15] [00:59:47]. He believes that losing weight drastically changes one's thought process, leading to increased confidence and a belief in oneself [01:03:14] [01:03:16] [01:03:17] [01:03:19] [01:03:21] [01:03:23] [01:03:28] [01:03:29] [01:03:32] [01:03:34] [01:03:35].

## Current Outlook
Tanmay is now a more "secure guy" and happy, acknowledging his insecurities but understanding there is "more to life than just productivity of work" [00:36:27] [00:36:29] [00:36:31] [00:36:33] [00:36:52] [00:36:54] [00:36:55] [00:36:56] [00:36:58] [00:37:00]. His priorities include creative flow (finishing a movie he's been writing) and long-term plans to help startups [00:43:47] [00:43:49] [00:43:51] [00:43:53] [00:43:55] [00:43:57] [00:44:01]. He wants to empower young talent, recognizing their potential and helping them grow beyond his own projects [00:37:25] [00:37:30] [00:37:31] [00:38:01] [00:38:03] [00:38:05] [00:38:07] [00:38:26] [00:38:29] [00:38:30] [00:38:31] [00:38:32] [00:38:34] [00:38:36] [00:38:37].

He advocates for "lazy geniuses"—people with fantastic ideas who find the quickest way to achieve goals, believing "laziness is underrated" and quantity is overrated [00:39:02] [00:39:05] [00:39:07] [00:39:09] [00:39:12] [00:39:14] [00:39:52] [00:39:53]. He looks for Fearless, radically thinking individuals who are adaptable and open-minded [00:40:02] [00:40:03] [00:40:06] [00:40:08] [00:40:11] [00:40:13] [00:40:16] [00:40:18] [00:40:19] [00:40:35] [00:40:38] [00:40:53] [00:40:56] [00:40:59] [00:41:01] [00:41:03] [00:41:04] [00:41:06] [00:41:08] [00:41:11].

Tanmay's overall message: "Life is incredibly long... play long-term games... everything isn't about now... take your time... make games and have fun playing it" [01:05:02] [01:05:05] [01:05:07] [01:05:09] [01:05:11] [01:05:13] [01:05:15] [01:05:19].

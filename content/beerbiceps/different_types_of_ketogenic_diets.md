The [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a super low-carb diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. While some studies suggest staying below 50g of carbs, personal experience indicates that an effective [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] requires staying below 20g of carbohydrates per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. For true ketosis, it's crucial to account for every single thing eaten, including small additions like garlic pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Foods like fruit and junk food should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>, and ideally, meals should be homemade to ensure control over ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>. The golden rule for [[science_behind_ketosis_and_ketone_bodies | ketosis]] is to stay below 20g of overall carbs for the day, ensuring minimal sugar intake from those carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. This means even avoiding vegetables with slightly high sugar content like onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.

## Two Kinds of Ketogenic Diets

There are two primary approaches to the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:56">[06:56:56]</a>:

### 1. The Textbook Ketogenic Diet

This version of the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is designed for the average person seeking fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:05">[07:05:05]</a>. To achieve rapid fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:29">[07:29:29]</a>, daily caloric intake should be below maintenance and split as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:13">[07:13:13]</a>:
*   **Fat**: 60-70% of total calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:17">[07:17:17]</a>
*   **Carbohydrates**: No more than 5% of total calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:21">[07:21:21]</a>
*   **Protein**: The remaining percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>

### 2. The Gymmer's Ketogenic Diet

This approach is for bodybuilders who aim to cut fat while preserving muscle mass after bulking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. It also applies to gym-goers who have already built substantial muscle and wish to get leaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:33">[07:33:33]</a>. For gymmers, the primary focus is hitting their protein goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:41">[07:41:41]</a>. The guideline is to consume approximately 80% of the daily protein goal and derive the remaining calories from fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:47">[07:47:47]</a>. This strategy helps burn fat while conserving strength and muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:03">[08:03:03]</a>. Over time on this diet, appetite may decrease, potentially allowing for a further reduction in protein intake while continuing to burn fat effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:57">[07:57:57]</a>.

## Refeed Days / Carb-Up Days

To manage a [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] effectively, incorporating refeed or carb-up days is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:10">[08:10:10]</a>. These days should occur every 10 to 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:15">[08:15:15]</a>, allowing for an intake of up to 400-500g of carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:17">[08:17:17]</a>. However, it is crucial that none of these carbohydrates come from sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:23">[08:23:23]</a>. On these days, one can enjoy a "cheat meal" without sugar, such as rice or a burger made with bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:38">[08:38:38]</a>. This high carb intake should only occur once every 10 to 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:48">[08:48:48]</a>.

## Duration of the Ketogenic Diet

A [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] should be undertaken for a minimum of 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:20">[09:20:20]</a>, and a maximum of 3 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:28">[09:28:28]</a>. Short-term attempts (2-3 weeks) often lead to rapid initial weight loss due to glycogen and water depletion, but this weight is quickly regained once normal eating resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:09">[09:09:09]</a>. Within its recommended duration, the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] can be highly beneficial for health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:32">[09:32:32]</a>.

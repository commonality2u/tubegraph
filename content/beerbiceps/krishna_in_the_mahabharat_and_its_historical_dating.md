This article explores the historical dating of the Mahabharata and the life of Shri Krishna, based on analysis of ancient Indian texts and modern scientific tools. The speaker emphasizes that Krishna was a historical individual who lived over 7,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Historical Evidence for Krishna
According to the speaker, there is significant evidence for Krishna's historical existence, potentially more than for many global personalities known to have existed less than 2,000 years ago, such as Jesus Christ, Alexander, Panini, and Kalidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This evidence includes both celestial and archaeological data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Celestial evidence, derived from ancient texts, is considered particularly robust as it cannot be manipulated or hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Modern astronomy simulation software, such as Voyager 4.5, can be used to verify these celestial descriptions for specific dates in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Dating the Mahabharata and Krishna's Life
The Mahabharata War is precisely dated to 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Krishna's passing, known as Krishna Nirwan, and the flooding of his city [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]], occurred 36 years after the war, in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

To establish Krishna's birth date, researchers relied on the Harivamsa and Bhagwat Puran, appendices to the Mahabharata. A specific celestial reference in Harivamsa, detailing a comet covering 13 *nakshatras* (half the visible sky), pinpointed the date of Krishna killing Kamsa to March 22, 5622 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The Bhagwat Puran states that Krishna was 11 years old when he killed Kamsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This calculation leads to Krishna's birth on June 27-28, 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

Subtracting his passing date from his birth date, Krishna lived for 108 years (5633 BCE - 5525 BCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This finding was corroborated by Madhvacharya's Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya, which states Krishna lived for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This independent validation, alongside the scientific and textual evidence, strongly supports the chronology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

> "There is much more evidence for Bhagwan Krishna who was here 7,500 years plus in comparison to even the world personalities that we know they existed even less than 2,000 years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Krishna's Early Life and Journey to Dwarka
Traditional narratives often depict heavy rain during Krishna's birth and Vasudeva's journey to Gokul/Ravana, with the Yamuna river swelling. However, historical climate data for the 6th millennium BCE indicates that the month of Shravana (when Krishna was born) was in the early summer season, with no rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The Harivamsa provides a more accurate description, mentioning Vasudeva walking along the dry bank of the Yamuna, encountering cut branches piled up for agriculture (slash-and-burn) and stepping on dry cow dung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This suggests that later narrators interpolated details based on their contemporary climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Krishna moved from Mathura to [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]] due to persistent attacks from Jarasandha, who defeated the Yadavas 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Moving to [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]], located on the west coast, allowed for uninterrupted sea trade, fostering prosperity for the Yadava clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]] was initially known as Kusasthali, a well-established city from approximately 30,000 years ago, which Krishna re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Archaeological findings support the existence of constructions dating back to 30,000 years in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. Krishna's [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]] was described as an island with bridges to the mainland, which was destroyed by rising sea waters in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. The current city of Dwarka is not the same as Krishna's Dwarka; the original site is off the coast near Somnath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

## Krishna's Role in the Mahabharata
[[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Krishna]] is a central figure and strategic character in the Mahabharata, not merely a philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. He met the Pandavas for the first time when they were 33 years old, at Draupadi's Swayamvar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Although his presence in the epic comes relatively late, he plays a crucial role in supporting the Pandavas, including through the Bhagavad Gita recited to Arjuna before the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Krishna's Intellectual Biography and Philosophy
[[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna's]] philosophy emphasizes a unique, synthesizing path, often referred to as "Murari" â€“ a path not commonly taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. He describes four types of devotees (*bhaktas*) in the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting that a *Jnani* (one who synthesizes knowledge, action, and devotion) is most beloved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>. His teachings also stress the importance of purpose-driven research and a purpose-driven life, where inquiry (*jigyasa*) should be *suddha* (well-studied) and *saprjna* (beneficial to humanity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Mahabharata Characters' Ages and Physicality
During the Mahabharata war, Krishna and Arjuna were approximately 70-72 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Bhishma was over 140 years old when he fought in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This highlights that long lifespans were accepted in ancient narratives, similar to figures in the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Misconceptions about characters like Bhima are also addressed. While often depicted as a strong but unintelligent figure, Bhima was a "Rodhr" (fox or jackal), implying a lean, muscular physique rather than a large tummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. He was also highly intelligent and often anticipated Krishna's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>. In the Draupadi Vasan incident, Bhima's immediate and violent reaction was later affirmed by Krishna, suggesting Bhima's actions were appropriate for the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>.

## Rakshasas and Cannibalism
The term "Rakshasas" in the Mahabharata, such as Hidimba and Bakasura, refers to powerful people, not necessarily demonic in a negative sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>. Some may have engaged in "bad habits" like cannibalism, which has historical parallels in various cultures across the world, even into recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>.

## Krishna's Gurus and Disciples
[[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] was not just a teacher but also a learner, taking [[The concept of Mahakal and its significance | diksha]] from several gurus like Sandipani and Ghora Angirasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He even took Shiva *diksha* to have a son from Rukmini, a story he himself narrates in the Mahabharata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:41">[02:10:41]</a>.

Krishna had two primary disciples: Arjuna and Uddhava. While Arjuna was powerful, he lost his strength after Krishna's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. Uddhava, however, was so deeply settled in Krishna's teachings that he remained unfazed by his guru's departure, demonstrating a higher state of spiritual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:12">[02:13:12]</a>.

## The End of the Yadava Clan
The destruction of the Yadava clan is often attributed to Gandhari's curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. However, a pragmatic view suggests that the immense prosperity of [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Dwarka]] led to the Yadavas becoming spoiled and engaging in destructive behavior, which Krishna recognized and allowed to run its course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a>.

## Descendants of Pandavas and Wider Historical Connections
The article briefly touches on the lineage after the Pandavas, mentioning Parikshit and a calculated timeline to Chanakya, emphasizing the lack of decisive proof for Chanakya's precise date in modern historical texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>.

There are also strong linkages between ancient Indian, Egyptian, and Mayan cultures. Accounts from historians like Megasthenes and Herodotus indicate very ancient Indian genealogies and connections. Megasthenes' records of Indian tradition existing for 7,000+ years and Herodotus's account of Egyptian king statues (dating back 14,000 years) align with the chronologies of the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] and [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:59">[02:16:59]</a>. The names of some Egyptian kings (Rameses, Metanis) bear resemblance to [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ikshvaku Dynasty]] names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:14">[02:18:14]</a>. Furthermore, similarities in sophisticated astronomy and cultural concepts (like the sun god Ra in Egypt and Ravi in India) suggest ancient connections between these civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:04">[02:19:04]</a>. This points to a much more widespread ancient culture, remnants of which are seen in present-day Hinduism and Zoroastrianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

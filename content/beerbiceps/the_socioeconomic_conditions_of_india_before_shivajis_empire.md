This article explores the socioeconomic and political landscape of India leading up to the formation of [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]'s empire, highlighting the realities faced by the average Indian and the ruling powers of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>. This period, particularly from the 12th to the 17th century, was characterized by significant upheaval and changes that shaped the mentality of the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

## The Mughal Empire and its Governance

Before the rise of [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivrai]], the [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal Empire]] held vast power, with 22 provinces under its control, especially in the North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. The empire's governance structure heavily relied on "mansabdars" and "jagirdars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. A "jagirdar" was a warrior granted land by the king or sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Their role involved being in charge of cultivators, collecting taxes, and maintaining a cavalry force for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This system, which outsourced the army, meant that 80% of the [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal Empire]]'s land was granted to these mansabdars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The primary industry was agriculture, with wealth extracted from cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The Mughals accumulated immense riches, estimated to be around 1.2 crore (12 million) rupees, which, when converted to silver coins (10 grams per rupee), amounted to 93,000 kilograms of gold â€“ equivalent to approximately $3.5 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. This wealth was largely derived from "sucking the blood and sweat" of the cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

The [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal military]] was formidable, consisting of 200,000 heavy-duty cavalrymen, 8,000 mansabdars, and 40,000 artillerymen trained by the Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>. They utilized lightweight cannons and explosive artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. The sheer numbers and equipment made the [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal army]] greatly feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

### Conditions in the Deccan

While the North was under [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal rule]], the Deccan (South India) was home to Sultanates like Nizam Shahi, Adil Shahi, and Qutb Shahi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in the deep South was almost vanishing by the time [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivrai]] was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The Mughals aimed to dissolve these Southern kingdoms into their empire rather than just keeping them as vassals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>.

[[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Aurangzeb]], seeking to gain power, aimed to conquer the wealthy Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi states, which were known for their diamond, spice, and elephant trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:56">[04:52:56]</a>.

## Socioeconomic Conditions of the Average Indian

India faced a period of immense suffering for approximately 800 years due to repeated invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. These invaders, often from regions like Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, came to rob India of its wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

The mentality of the Indian populace shifted; they became "secondary citizens," accepting their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. This period was marked by brutality:
*   Mass killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   Women and children taken as "chattel property" and sex slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   Instances where "any Hindu woman" could be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   Torture chambers, explicitly detailed in historical accounts of the Portuguese in Goa during the 15th and 16th centuries, where people were subjected to extreme pain if they refused to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. Methods included tearing flesh with sharp instruments, even from pregnant women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

The common terms reflecting the pervasive insecurity were "Sultani Calamity" (calamity caused by raiders/sultans) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disasters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:56">[02:30:56]</a>. People lived with constant fear and insecurity, not knowing what tomorrow would bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>.

Under the mansabdar system, justice for the common Indian was questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. These military men, who were ruthless warriors, held significant power, and people in their areas feared them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

[[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | Racial discrimination]] was also prevalent within the [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal army]]. Soldiers from Central Asia (Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkistanis) with fairer skin were favored and likely paid more than dark-skinned Indian Hindus and Marathas who were also part of the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

## Historical Perspective and Sources

Understanding this period is crucial to comprehending [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s mentality, history, and conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:01">[03:48:01]</a>. The purpose of history is to teach lessons and prevent repetition, especially given the dangerous geopolitical environment today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Highlighting the psychology of defeated people is considered important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

Historical portrayals, especially in films, often romanticize figures like Akbar, presenting a positive image that might not align with historical truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The speaker argues that while historical fiction can be entertaining, it often distorts reality for those who consume it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:08">[03:07:08]</a>. For example, Akbar was described as cruel, killing subordinates and taking their women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>.

Genuine historical research involves studying original correspondence (Cusp Wt), metal plate inscriptions (Tamar Patra), and filtering information from "bakhars" (accounts written by court members that might be biased) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Historians like Sir Jadunath Sarkar, who spent 50 years studying [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Emperor Aurangzeb]], and Gajanan Mehendle, who studied Modi and Persian scripts for his [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivrai]] research, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. An empathetic and instinctive approach, reading between the lines, is necessary to connect historical dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>.

### Mughal Succession and Ruthlessness

The [[the_mughal_empire_and_its_governance_structure | Mughal Empire]] had no rule for primogeniture; succession often involved ruthless competition, where brothers fought and killed each other for the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. This pattern was evident in [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s ascent, where he eliminated his brothers, including Dara Shikho, Murad Bakhsh, and Shah Shuja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Even previous emperors like Shah Jahan had killed 36 relatives to secure the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This created a situation where it was "either the throne or the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

For instance, Salim (Jahangir), [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Akbar]]'s son, tortured his own son, Khusrau, by blinding him and putting salt water in his eye sockets for greater pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Khusrau was later killed by Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Similarly, [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Aurangzeb]] had his brother Dara Shikho beheaded after a trial under Sharia law, partly because Dara had written a book titled "Mingling of Two Oceans," which was considered a crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. Murad, [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s brother, died from an opium overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>, while [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s own son, Mohammed Sultan, died of depression in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

[[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | Religion]] was often used as a tool by rulers to control masses and gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. This highlights how ambitious politicians, like the emperors, understood how to use emotions and [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | religion]] to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

This dark period of Indian history, marked by suffering, fear, and a loss of self-esteem for the common people, sets the stage for the emergence of leaders like [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

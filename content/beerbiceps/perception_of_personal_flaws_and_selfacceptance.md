Success in life is influenced by the ability to work hard and maintain a correct career mindset. Before entering the "real world," it's crucial to work on improving every aspect of one's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Using External Criticism for Growth

People who make fun, doubt, or even break one's heart can be catalysts for [[selfconfidence_and_growth | growth in life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Negative experiences, such as being made fun of for weight or being told one won't do well, can be transformed into motivation or fuel for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Life is a constant [[personal_growth_and_selfexploration | self-improvement]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Instead of dwelling on negative feelings about people or situations, one can choose to [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | grow in every aspect of life]] and strive to become the best version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

> "If you feel like you're inferior now, that's okay. Life is a constant self-improvement process, so you can choose to sit and feel bad about people and feel bad about your situation or you can choose to grow in every aspect of life and become that best version of yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

## Understanding Personal Flaws

One's personal flaws are often much smaller than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Whether it's acne or extra body fat, the reality is that nobody is perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. People tend to notice their own flaws more than others do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. In a world characterized by fakness and insecurity, it's essential to learn to love oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Embracing Self-Love and Acceptance

There are aspects of oneself that cannot be changed, such as hair type, skin color, or nose shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For these unchangeable traits, it is important to learn to love them, as they contribute to who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For aspects that *can* be changed, such as clothing choices or other factors related to external appearance, efforts can be made to improve them with correct knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This process is part of the transition from childhood to adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

[[building_confidence_and_selfacceptance_in_appearance | Building external confidence]] can lead to [[building_selfconfidence_and_internal_happiness | internal confidence]], which in turn fosters internal happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Beyond External Validation (Marks and Reputation)

Academic marks do not define an individual's happiness or entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While marks might influence the initial chapters of a career (e.g., the first 5-10 years), ultimately, what matters more is one's competence in their chosen field, their character, and the love they invest in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Parental and teacher pressure regarding marks often stems from a desire to protect their own reputations or as a form of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Scoring poorly is merely a small moment on the timeline of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Future success is determined not by marks, but by one's "hustle" throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It's important to hustle towards becoming the best version of oneself and to love every part of who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Formula for Success

A three-point formula for success in life includes:
1.  **Love:** Love people and love life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  **Gratitude:** Have gratitude for everything the world has provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
3.  **Happiness:** Focus on happiness and the positives of one's situation, life, and self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals are more beautiful than they can imagine, and it is up to them to realize this truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The field of archaeology is constantly evolving, with new discoveries challenging established narratives and revealing the vast, unexplored depths of human history. Experts estimate that only about 10% of human history has been discovered so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This includes much of the world's underwater heritage, which holds significant potential for understanding ancient civilizations and their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## The Role of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is the country's main archaeological institution, founded by the British officer and archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, who was initially a "treasure hunter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The ASI's mandate includes exploration, excavation, and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Recently, the exploration of underwater heritage has become a priority for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

## India's Ancient Past and Submerged Cities

India is considered to be "number one in being old" when it comes to ancient human history, with archaeological findings nearly everywhere one digs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The subcontinent's subtropical climate made it conducive for long-term settlement without the need for migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### The Indus Valley Civilization
The [[lost_history_and_archeological_mysteries_of_ancient_india | Indus Valley Civilization]], also known as the Harappan Civilization, is the earliest known civilization of India with direct contact with the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. Most of its remains are located in Pakistan, but a significant portion is in India, much of which is still underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

Notable sites include:
*   **Rakhigarhi:** An ongoing excavation site in Haryana, situated on a mount where a heavily populated village currently exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lothal:** A port found in Gujarat, which served as a reception point for people from Mesopotamia and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
*   **Dholavira:** Located in the Rann of Kutch, this site shows that a civilization thrived in a salt desert as early as 2000-1500 BCE, demonstrating advanced techniques to filter salty water and grow food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>.

### Dwarka: The Indian Atlantis
The city of Dwarka, located just off the coast of Gujarat, is often referred to as the "Indian Atlantis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. It was a well-planned city that likely served as a major trading port connecting India with Africa, Europe, and Central Asia before it became submerged underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. Underwater archaeology is actively exploring this site to understand the full extent of India's past landmass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. Submerged parts of India like Dwarka are significant "areas of interest" for global archaeology, serving as early connecting points with other civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>.

## Global Human History and Migration

The prevailing consensus is that human life originated in Africa, and early humans undertook multiple great migrations across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. This understanding is based on current evidence, but archaeologists acknowledge that future discoveries could change this perspective, as only a small fraction of history has been unearthed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

![[theories_on_lost_ancient_civilizations_and_their_possible_technologies | Theories on Lost Civilizations]]
The migration patterns of humans across continents were significantly influenced by [[geological_and_catastrophical_events_in_ancient_history | geological and catastrophical events in ancient history]] and global warming and cooling periods, which caused changes in water levels, hiding or exposing landmasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. For example, North America and Russia were once connected by a massive landmass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. Similarly, India and Sri Lanka were visibly connected by shallow land in the recent past, such as the Dhanushkodi area near Rameswaram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

## Challenging Traditional Historical Narratives

The limited nature of current archaeological findings means that much of what is taught in history textbooks is a simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>. For instance, the traditional view of human history being only 2,500 to 3,000 years old is debated, as evidence suggests human history spans millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>.

### The Problem with Circumstantial Evidence
[[conspiracy_theories_and_lesserknown_historical_perspectives | Conspiracy theories]] like the [[influence_of_alien_theories_in_ancient_cultures | alien theory]] in archaeology and human civilization are rejected due to a lack of hard evidence, relying instead on circumstantial evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. The argument that humans were incapable of building ancient structures, therefore attributing them to aliens, discounts human capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. Humans are believed to be capable of great things, as evidenced by ancient forts and structures like those found near the Tungabhadra River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

### Consciousness and Ancient Cultures
The development of consciousness and intellectual power in early humans is evident in prehistoric cave paintings worldwide, which demonstrate advanced organizational levels and imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>. Practices such as Yoga and meditation, along with the study of ancient texts, can help tap into and expand consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:00">[35:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.

The philosophical depth of texts that emerged from India, particularly from the 9th to 10th centuries, covering Shaivism, Brahminism, Vaishnavism, Shakta, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions, was "mind-bogglingly deep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:48:00">[37:48:00]</a>. Scholars like Abhinavagupta from Kashmir, who wrote the *Tantra Sara* and *Tantra Loka* in the 9th-10th centuries, formulated deep theories, including the central role of female identity within male identity in Shaivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>.

### Ancient Indian Temples and Their Design
[[ancient_indian_temples_and_their_advanced_construction_techniques | Ancient Indian temples and their advanced construction techniques]] are generally pyramidal or triangular in shape, not square, reflecting deep philosophical meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>. Female temples (Yogini temples) are circular, while male temples are phallic, symbolizing creation through their union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:34:00">[40:34:00]</a>. Examples like the Khajuraho Temples and Odisha Temples (Konark) feature elaborate, often sexual, imagery on their exteriors, which symbolizes life's "fringe layer" and the journey towards the austere, silent inner sanctum of the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>.

Some temples and monuments have hidden chambers, often closed for conservation reasons, such as the Queen's Hammam in Red Fort due to delicate marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:00">[47:30:00]</a>. Tunnels leading from Mughal monuments, some extending to Delhi, are also shut for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:00">[47:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>. The ASI does not acknowledge "spiritual inhibition" or metaphysical reasons for these closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>.

### Mythology and Natural Explanations
[[comparative_mythology_between_indian_texts_and_other_ancient_cultures | Comparative mythology]] often reveals parallels in how ancient cultures explained natural phenomena. For instance, the widespread depiction of sea dragons (Makara in Southeast Asia) and other sea monsters in various cultures, including China, India, and Indonesia, is linked to the rise of seafaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>. These mythological creatures likely served as explanations for powerful, destructive natural events like typhoons and tsunamis that were beyond human understanding at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>.

## Funding and Future of Archaeology in India

Despite India's rich history, funding for archaeology is "backwards" and "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. There is a call for wealthy individuals and businesses to invest in Indian history and culture through philanthropic grants, rather than focusing on "returns on investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. The Tata Trust is highlighted as a consistent supporter of cultural initiatives in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. The Archaeological Survey of India has a National Culture Fund where financial aid can be provided to support its core activities: exploration, excavation, and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

Geo-politics plays a role in revealing and hiding aspects of history, as a full revelation of everything could change human self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. The field of historical research is still influenced by powerful individuals and their decisions about what information is made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Praveen Mohan, an engineer and YouTuber, challenges conventional historical narratives by exploring ancient sites in India and worldwide to uncover forgotten truths about the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. His work often highlights discrepancies between mainstream historical accounts and the advanced nature of ancient constructions, suggesting a recalculation of human civilization's timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Challenging Traditional Historical Views

Mainstream history often presents a linear evolution of technology and civilization, where newer structures are expected to be superior or larger than older ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, Mohan points out anomalies in ancient Indian architecture that contradict this idea of progressive evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

For example, the Ajanta Caves are considered both the largest and oldest cave temple structure in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. Similarly, the Kallanai Dam, a massive structure that changed the flow of a river, is both the largest and oldest ancient dam in India, dating back 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The Kailasa Temple, carved from a single mountain 1,300 years ago, lacks any smaller precursors or larger successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, suggesting a sudden appearance of advanced construction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. This lack of an evolutionary pattern suggests that [[influence_of_ancient_technologies_in_construction | ancient civilizations]] possessed technologies that were later lost or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Advanced Ancient Technologies

Mohan argues that many ancient temples were not built with "primitive tools" like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, but rather with [[influence_of_ancient_technologies_in_construction | advanced machinery]]:
*   **Lathe Machines**: Pillars in temples like Halebidu and Chennakesava in Karnataka exhibit turn marks, confirming they were made using lathe technology, which creates perfect circular shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. These machines would have been enormous, possibly hundreds of meters long, to handle pillars weighing 20 tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Hollow Stone Carvings**: A one-inch wide stone skull on a *Dwarapalika* (doorkeeper) statue in a temple is completely hollow, with intricate passages for a thread to pass through its eyes, ears, and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. This precision is deemed impossible with basic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Earthquake-Proofing (Ramappa Temple)**: The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, dating back 800-900 years, uses bricks that float in water, similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This lightweight material helped the temple withstand a massive earthquake that destroyed all other nearby structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. This technology, similar to what Japan uses today, suggests ancient builders anticipated seismic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

## Global Connections and Shared Narratives

Mohan's research extends beyond India, revealing surprising parallels between ancient civilizations across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:58">[04:19:58]</a>.

### The Naga Phenomenon
A significant parallel is the widespread belief and depiction of [[nagas_and_their_role_in_ancient_civilizations | Nagas]]. In Hindu scriptures, Nagas are not merely snakes but a distinct species of humanoids, capable of shapeshifting, and often described as living in subterranean realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

*   **Global Presence**: Naga worship and similar concepts are found globally:
    *   **Peru**: Popular gods are [[nagas_and_their_role_in_ancient_civilizations | Nagas]], referred to as "Amaru," a Sanskrit-like word meaning "immortal God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. This points to [[ancient_connections_between_india_and_south_america | ancient connections between India and South America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
    *   **Colombia**: A *shivling* guarded by a Naga is found in San Agust√≠n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
    *   **Mayans**: The Naga culture is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
    *   **Israel**: Nagas are called "Nakash," and serpents are called "Saraf" in the Bible, closely mirroring the Sanskrit "Sarpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
    *   **Cambodia**: The first ruler of Cambodia, Soma, was a woman who descended from the Nagas and married a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. Ancient Hindu sites like Angkor Borei, dating back 2,000-4,000 years, show prevalent Naga carvings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
    *   **USA**: The Great Serpent Mound in Ohio is a giant snake effigy visible only from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

*   **Nagas as Ancient Rulers**: Across various ancient civilizations, a common narrative suggests that the first kings and queens were Nagas, who descended to civilize humans and build advanced structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This theory posits them as a different, possibly alien, race that taught early humans about construction and other technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. The consistent presence of Naga carvings in almost all ancient temples worldwide, unlike other deities, suggests their antiquity and foundational role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.

### Knowledge of Extinct Species
Praveen Mohan notes the presence of accurate carvings of extinct animals in ancient temples, raising questions about the knowledge base of ancient civilizations:
*   **Stegosaurus in Ta Prohm Temple**: In Cambodia's Ta Prohm Temple (a Brahma Temple), a carving strikingly resembles a Stegosaurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. As dinosaurs are believed to have become extinct 65 million years ago, this carving, dating back 1,000-2,000 years, poses a significant historical mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Four-Tusked Elephant in Angkor Wat**: Angkor Wat features a carving of an elephant with four tusks, a species believed to have become extinct 100,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. These depictions suggest that ancient people had knowledge of creatures from deep time, possibly through records or direct observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **Dragons as Dinosaurs**: Mohan suggests that the prevalence of dragon imagery across all ancient cultures, including Hindu temples, might refer to observations of dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

## Temples as Repositories of Knowledge

Mohan believes that ancient temples were not merely places of worship but served as comprehensive educational institutions, or "Wikipedias in stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. Carvings were intentionally placed at different levels to cater to various age groups and aspects of life:
*   **Children (0-5 years)**: Carvings at the bottom level depict animals, some humorous or engaging, like a baby elephant drinking milk or a monkey riding a goat, serving as ancient "Animal Planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>.
*   **Youth (6-10 years)**: This level features carvings related to music and dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.
*   **Teenagers (11-15 years)**: Focus on science and technology, such as a precise sundial at Konark Temple that can tell time to the minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. This [[archaeological_and_celestial_evidence | archaeological and celestial evidence]] highlights advanced scientific understanding.
*   **Older Teenagers (16-20 years)**: Depictions of war, administration, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.
*   **Young Adults (21-25 years)**: Features erotica and aspects of love-making, reflecting a "Carefree" and "liberal" ancient Indian society that normalized these aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.
*   **Medical Knowledge**: Carvings also illustrate advanced medical practices, such as women giving birth while standing, a recommended practice today for utilizing gravity, and tribal disinfection rituals after childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>.

These intricate carvings, made in stone to withstand the test of time and destruction, represent a deliberate effort to preserve and transmit knowledge across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

Mohan encourages critical thinking about historical accounts, suggesting that there are "serious holes in history and archaeology books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>. The advanced technologies, global commonalities in narratives like the Nagas, and detailed educational purpose of temples imply that human civilization is far older and has experienced more complex trajectories, including periods of lost knowledge and potentially interactions with more advanced beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. This perspective challenges the idea that modern society is the most advanced, prompting further exploration into the true scope of [[cultural_and_genetic_impacts_of_ancient_events | ancient human achievement and its influences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>.

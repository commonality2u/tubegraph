Success, money, and fame are influenced by one's ability to work hard and possess the correct career mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Before entering the adult world, it is crucial to improve one's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Key lessons from teenage years emphasize transforming challenges and self-perception into opportunities for growth.

## Embracing Criticism and Doubt

People who mock, doubt, or break your heart can be instrumental in your [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure|growth in life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Negative experiences, such as being made fun of for weight or being told you won't succeed, can be used as motivation or fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Your future is solely in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Life is a continuous [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure|self-improvement]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Instead of dwelling on negative situations or feelings of inferiority, one can choose to [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure|grow]] in every aspect and become the best version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Understanding and Accepting Personal Flaws

Your [[understanding_and_accepting_personal_flaws|flaws]] are often perceived as much smaller by others than by yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Whether it's acne or extra body fat, the truth is nobody is perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In a world full of fakeness and insecurity, it's essential to learn to [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance|love yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

There are aspects of yourself that cannot be changed (e.g., hair, skin color, nose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For these, it is important to learn to [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance|love]] them, as they define who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Conversely, there are external factors that *can* be changed, such as clothing choices or other aspects of external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Working on these changeable aspects is part of the transition from childhood to adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

```ad-note
External confidence can foster internal confidence, which, in turn, leads to internal happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Redefining Success Beyond Academic Marks

Academic marks should not define an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While society often emphasizes marks as indicators of future happiness, they primarily determine only the initial chapters of a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Five to ten years into a career, factors like college attended or math scores become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. What truly matters is:
*   Competence in one's chosen field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   The kind of human being you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   The passion and love put into everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>

Pressure from parents and teachers often stems from a desire to protect their own reputations or to motivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Scoring poorly is a minor point on the timeline of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Marks do not dictate your future; rather, the "hustle" in the rest of your life does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This includes [[learning_from_failures|hustling]] towards becoming the best version of yourself and [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance|loving]] every part of who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Formula for Success

The three-point formula for success in life is:
1.  Love people and love your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  Have gratitude for everything the world has given you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
3.  Focus on happiness and all the positives of your situation, life, and who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Ultimately, you are more beautiful than you can imagine, and the journey is to realize this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

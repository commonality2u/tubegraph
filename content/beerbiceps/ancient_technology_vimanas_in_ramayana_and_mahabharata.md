Vimanas are described as "ancient aeroplanes" in [[Modern interpretation of ancient Indian texts | ancient Indian texts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>. This concept has gained traction in the West, with figures like Joe Rogan discussing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Descriptions in Ancient Texts

Detailed accounts of Vimanas, particularly the Pushpak Vimana, are found in the [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | Valmiki Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>. These descriptions align with what is understood about modern aeroplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.

Key characteristics mentioned include:
*   **Noise during takeoff** Vimanas made "big noise" when taking off, similar to modern aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:19">[01:34:19]</a>.
*   **Instability due to air currents** [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | Valmiki Ramayana]] also notes that air currents could make them unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.

In the [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | Mahabharata]], there are mentions of Vimanas, such as that belonging to Upari Chara, who existed just before the Pandavas, and Salva's plane, named 'Saubha', which was used to attack Krishna's Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. While the texts describe their function, they generally do not detail the technology behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

### The Pushpak Vimana
After Ravana's defeat, Vibhishana confidently tells Rama that the Pushpak Vimana can transport him to Ayodhya in less than a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. This implies a high-speed travel capability that was well-known and reliable within the context of the narrative.

### Vaimanika Shastra
There is a text known as the Vaimanika Shastra, attributed to the 12th century, which attempts to describe Vimanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. However, some researchers note that the materials described in this text are often referred to by words whose meanings are no longer known, making it difficult to understand the technical specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26">[01:53:26]</a>.

## Corroborating Evidence

The presence of Vimanas in [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | ancient Indian texts]] is used to explore advanced [[Ancient Hindu culture and its scientific aspects | knowledge]] and technology. For instance, the descriptions of the Pushpak Vimana are consistent with what is known about modern aerospace technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>.

The ability of ancient texts to describe phenomena consistent with later scientific understanding, such as the detailed astronomical observations in the [[Ancient Hindu culture and its scientific aspects | Surya Siddhanta]], lends credence to the idea that these texts might contain records of advanced concepts or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.

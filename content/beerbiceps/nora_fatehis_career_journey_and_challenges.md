Nora Fatehi is described as one of the Indian film industry's most misunderstood and misrepresented people, especially by the interviewer after their recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. People often don't understand what it takes for someone to leave their home country and build a flourishing career in another over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. As a self-made individual, particularly outside her geographical comfort zone, she has developed many layers of personality and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## The Journey to Stardom

Fatehi's career journey has been a "staircase" rather than a "lift" or "escalator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Her aspiration to secure lead roles in films has been a decade-long struggle, involving knocking on doors and progressing from special features, songs, and small supporting roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This difficult ascent meant feeling fatigued and needing breaks along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, she sets goals that are "almost unattainable" and finds immense satisfaction in achieving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Fatehi, originally from North Africa and Morocco, initially disliked being termed a "foreigner" in India, as it stereotyped non-Indians into a single "gora" (white) box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. She often had to explain her brown, North African, Moroccan background and the cultural similarities between Middle Eastern, South Asian, and North African communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Her ability to connect with the Indian audience and their relatability to her helped her succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Within the industry, she is known for her hard work and is spoken of with respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

From a young age, Fatehi desired fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>. As a three-year-old, she would cry if she didn't get claps after dancing at family functions and would throw fits if her mother tried to remove her from the center of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>. This desire for validation and admiration is a core part of her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">[56:03:00]</a>.

## [[Acting career challenges | Challenges in the Industry]]

The industry is very tough, requiring constant alertness to discern who to trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Fatehi emphasizes the need to be protective of one's energy and aura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. She has faced bullying and undermining attempts, particularly because her directness and intimidating personality are disliked by some who prefer quiet, submissive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>. People often spread lies and engage in online gossip on platforms like Reddit, damaging her reputation, yet she cannot directly refute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>.

She questions why people talk negatively about her despite her success, citing her billions of views, millions of followers, and opportunities as proof of her hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38:00">[34:38:00]</a>.

## Dealing with Negative Energies ("Nazar")

Fatehi deeply believes in "Nazar," the evil eye, especially for public figures who are constantly under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. She experiences physical discomfort, pain, and drain after events, which she attributes to Nazar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Not all attention is positive; some people look at stars with envy, hate, and jealousy, wishing bad upon them, which can manifest as sickness, mental disturbance, or even a dulling of one's aura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. This, she believes, is why many stars struggle with depression and anxiety, and some even become suicidal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Competition and rivals plotting against one's success also contribute to this negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

To counter Nazar, practices like reading Quran (for Muslims), saltwater baths, and ancestral rituals are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. She confirms that Nazar can be digitally transmitted through watching videos or seeing pictures, as eyes are considered the "gate of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

## Navigating Personal Life and Relationships

[[Overcoming challenges in early career | Fatehi's career]] demanded significant personal sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. She identifies as a workaholic, constantly thinking about her next career moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. For a decade, she missed numerous family eventsâ€”birthdays, graduations, friends' weddings, even her brother's wedding and the birth of his sons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. She feels a constant need to prove herself, which stems from her awareness of the immense personal sacrifices she's made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

She believes that "predators" exist in all industries, not just entertainment, and they "sniff out victims" by identifying vulnerable or desperate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. Her intimidating and direct personality has often protected her from such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. She recounts an early experience in India where someone tried to corner her for opportunities, but her willingness to walk away and return to Canada to study law or teaching disarmed the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. She acknowledges that many people unwillingly give in to such demands because they are in desperate situations and aren't given a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31:00">[40:31:00]</a>.

Fatehi extends the concept of "predators" to those who use relationships for clout, networking, money, or relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>. She observes that many in her industry marry for these reasons, sacrificing their personal lives and mental health for fame and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:09:00">[47:09:00]</a>. She maintains a guarded personal life, choosing to stay single to filter people and understand their intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:42:00">[45:42:00]</a>. She also had a "terrible" past relationship experience that was "deeper, darker, scarier" than mere cheating, which led her to build protective barriers around herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

On gender roles, Fatehi asserts that men and women need each other, disagreeing with radical feminism that suggests complete independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. She believes traditional roles, where men are providers and breadwinners and women are nurturers, are normal and essential for societal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. She argues that women's physiology, with monthly hormonal shifts, is not designed for the modern 9-to-5 grind, which is built for men's daily testosterone cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. She believes radical feminism has "f***** up our society" by destroying family units and feminine energy, leading to widespread anxiety and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. She suggests that if men embrace their roles as providers and protectors, women can surrender to their nurturing roles, creating a balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

She candidly states that "girls are not sweet" and that many women are "crazy" and "conniving," capable of manipulation and lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>. This perspective, she feels, is often hidden behind societal perceptions influenced by media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:35">[01:34:35]</a>.

## Spiritual Shield

Fatehi emphasizes the role of spiritual practices as a shield. She relies on prayer, fasting, and spiritual connection to maintain discipline, strength, and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:55">[01:38:55]</a>. Fasting, a practice since age 14, enhances her discipline and spiritual sensitivity, allowing her to stay in tune with her intuition even while working and traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. Prayer, akin to meditation, requires immense self-discipline and mental focus to connect with the Creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. This practice builds character, morals, and self-control, offering spiritual protection from external negative energies and people with ill intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>.

## Future Aspirations

Fatehi is currently working towards a global career, having signed a global record deal with Warner America and Global Warner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. This ambition comes with the continued sacrifice of her personal life, as it demands full, undivided attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. Despite her intense focus on her career, she also desires to be a mother and a wife, seeking to balance these significant life goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>.

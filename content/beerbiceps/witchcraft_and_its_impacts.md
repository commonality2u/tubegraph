Witchcraft, often perceived as an occult practice, encompasses a range of beliefs and activities, some of which are believed to have significant impacts on individuals and their environments. The discussion of witchcraft often intersects with broader topics of [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | spiritual beings]] and [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | entities]].

## Types of Witches and Entities

Some entities are culturally identified with witchcraft or similar dark practices:

*   **Chudel and Dyan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: These are considered a kind of witch or similar entity in Indian folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Their origin theory suggests that a woman who dies during childbirth or while pregnant, and is not properly cremated with all rituals, may turn into a Chudel due to latent desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. As a Chudel, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women, acting as a vengeful entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Dyans are described along similar lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Personal Encounters and Perceived Impacts

One individual shared a personal experience involving what they believe to be witchcraft or a dark occult influence:

*   **Psychic Intervention and Effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>: A psychic friend contacted the individual, sensing a "dark aura" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

During meditation that night, the individual experienced a sharp, physical sensation like a pin being shoved into their finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. The psychic refused to explain the incident, only advising continued meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

*   **Motivation for Black Magic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>: It is suggested that black magic can be used to take something from another person, such as youth or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

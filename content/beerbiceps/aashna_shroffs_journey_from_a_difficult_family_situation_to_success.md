Aashna Shroff, a prominent figure in fashion blogging, credits her entire family situation for shaping her into the person she is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Her journey from humble beginnings, marked by significant financial struggles, to achieving a "dream life" as a successful blogger, serves as an inspiration to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Family Background

Aashna Shroff was raised primarily by her mother, who got divorced around the time Aashna was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:08">[02:18:08]</a>. She grew up living with her maternal grandparents, her mother's "masi" (aunt), her mother, and her mother's older sister, who has Down syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>. This complex family dynamic meant that her mother was the sole earner, responsible for taking care of four other people at home in addition to Aashna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:03">[02:36:03]</a>.

The family faced severe financial hardship. Aashna's mother never explicitly told her, but at one point, there was only 1,500 rupees in their account for the entire family, with seemingly "no way forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>. This challenging upbringing, marked by her mother's relentless work and the responsibility felt from a young age, significantly influenced Aashna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:08">[02:34:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Her experience is a clear example of [[role_of_family_and_support_system_in_aashna_shroffs_career | the significant role of family and support systems]] and [[the_influence_of_family_dynamics_on_success | the influence of family dynamics on success]].

## Entrepreneurial Beginnings and Rise to Success

Aashna's desire to provide for her family, especially her mother, fueled her ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. She gives all her earnings to her mother, wanting her to "run the house" and "enjoy her life" since she never got to do so before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This strong family bond and motivation highlight her [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | personal growth journey]].

She began her entrepreneurial journey with an online store, a Facebook page where she imported and sold products from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:03">[03:54:03]</a>. She then started posting her own outfit pictures on Instagram, and positive feedback led to suggestions for her to start a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:08">[04:04:08]</a>. Blogging was a relatively new concept in India at the time, making it a "gamble," but her online store served as a backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:03">[04:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Her first paid collaboration happened a year after starting her blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:03">[04:36:03]</a>. It was with India Circus, earning her 5,000 rupees for a blog post and three Instagram posts, a sum that brought her immense happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:03">[04:39:03]</a>.

Today, after nearly five years, her blog is her primary focus, generating a significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. While freelance income varies, she estimates her company makes between 5 to 10 lakhs (500,000 to 1,000,000 Indian rupees) per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Her current brand deals often run into "five possibly six digits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:07">[04:56:07]</a>.

### Business Operations

Aashna's blogging business operates by brands contacting her via email to promote products, campaigns, or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. She only accepts collaborations with brands she genuinely loves and can connect with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:03">[05:45:03]</a>. The process involves:
*   Content planning and shoot dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>
*   Arranging for producers, locations, and photographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>
*   Her manager, who is her mother's cousin, handles all financial negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Aashna acknowledges this as her weakness and ensures she surrounds herself with people who complement her skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Strengths

Aashna offers valuable advice for aspiring entrepreneurs:
*   **Find your passion and push it**: Don't give up, especially if you prefer to work for yourself rather than a corporate job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Work speaks for itself**: Even if you are shy or not highly social, good work will attract opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Patience, hard work, and authenticity**: These are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. She emphasizes staying true to yourself and not losing your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

Aashna identifies her biggest strength as her "stubbornness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. She recalls a time, about a year and a half into her blog, when her mother advised her to shut it down and focus on her more profitable online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Aashna refused, choosing to make time for both, a decision she is now glad she made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

She also strongly believes in manifestation, noting that good things tend to happen if you want them, though they may take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. She believes the energies you put out into the world are what you receive back, combined with continuous hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

Aashna Shroff's journey embodies persistence, determination, and the powerful impact of a strong work ethic fueled by personal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

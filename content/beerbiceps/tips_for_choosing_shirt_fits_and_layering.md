    *   They may be suitable for overweight or very underweight individuals who are conscious about their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Shirt Layering Techniques

When layering shirts, keep the following ground rules in mind:

*   **Base Layer:** You should only layer your shirts with a plain white or a plain black T-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Jacket-Style Layering:**
    *   This is the only type of shirt layering where you can leave both your shirt and your T-shirt untucked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Shirt-Over-T-shirt Layering (Not Jacket Style):**
    *   It is considered a style mistake to leave your shirt untucked when layering it over a t-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   Instead, tuck your shirt inside your pants for a neater and classier look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Shirt-Under-Jacket Layering:**
    *   When layering your shirt with a jacket, the only way to do it correctly is when your shirt is tucked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   Leaving it untucked with a jacket is a significant style mistake and looks untidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

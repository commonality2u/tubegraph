[[Challenges and philosophies of being a soldier in combat | Military life]] involves a unique blend of psychological resilience and ethical considerations, shaped by intense experiences and the demanding nature of service. This includes operating under extreme pressure, making life-or-death decisions, adhering to strict codes of conduct, and confronting immense human suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## The Soldier's Mindset
Soldiers, especially those in [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | special forces]] or combat operations, operate at their mental and physical threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A snap decision can cost a life, particularly for teammates, placing immense responsibility on leaders to lead from the front and ensure that the same number of troops who go into an operation return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Facing Imminent Danger
In combat situations, the mind can go blank when confronted with unexpected threats, such as an enemy pointing a weapon at one's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This immediate reaction highlights the intense psychological impact of direct danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Psychological Resilience
In [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | Airborne operations]], where a significant casualty rate is anticipated during jumps, successful landing alone is considered lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. The survivors then bear the burden of carrying out the mission for those who didn't make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. This requires tremendous practice, grit, and a strong heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

After a tragic incident where three soldiers died during a night jump due to equipment failure, new parachutes were immediately deployed, and all personnel were sent back into the air for another jump the same night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. This ritual was crucial to prevent fear from spreading and to reinforce the understanding that such incidents, while unfortunate, are part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

> "Once you don't do this thing and know the Fear Factor and it becomes a gossip you know something went wrong you know it can happen no once you're done with this ritual then people are the saying you know things happens it happens it is a part and parcel of this job and these are professional agits this is not the first time it has happened neither it is going to be last time nobody can guarantee such things will keep happening but you can't let it go and that Fear Factor should not come it had happened we just did it again nothing happened so don't worry chill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>

## Ethical Dilemmas and Moral Codes
Military personnel frequently encounter complex ethical situations where standard orders may conflict with humanitarian principles.

### Manipur Conflict Learnings
During service in Manipur, several key ethical and psychological observations were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>:
*   **Military Perspective:** The Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinels of the Northeast," demonstrated an amazing capability to operate smoothly across diverse regions, leveraging their "mini-India" composition with members from various states and linguistic backgrounds who nonetheless shared common habits and spoke Gorkhali/Nepali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Their long service tenure (up to 60 years) provided invaluable experience and professional advice in combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Militant Perspective:** Surprisingly, the militant groups in Manipur operated with a very strong ethical and moral code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. They never harmed women, children, or elderly people, and any wrongdoing by their members against the public would result in public apologies and court-of-inquiry proceedings published in newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Military personnel with their families were considered "walking insurance policies" by these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Civilian/Public Perspective:** The local population's attitude was heavily influenced by how they were treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Respecting age, gender, and being nice to people ensured safety and cooperation <a class="yt:timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Trust could be built, even leading to attending marriage functions in remote areas without weapons, relying purely on the host's invitation as an "insurance policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
    *   The overarching lesson from Manipur was that "situation in an area is as good or bad as you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Experiencing Sudan
Service in Sudan, particularly in areas like Abay, presented dire [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | operational challenges]] and extreme ethical tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Crisis:** Life had absolutely no value, with people resorting to violence for basic needs like a piece of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. There was no water, only oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, and people were observed drinking cow blood for thirst and eating boot polish or medicines from garbage dumps due to starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   **Confronting Barbarianism:** The region suffered from extreme political instability, resulting in rampant "barbarianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. Militant groups, surprisingly well-armed despite the lack of basic resources, engaged in horrific acts like chopping off heads and playing football with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Defying Orders for Humanity:** Despite explicit orders not to provide water or food to civilians outside military compounds, soldiers would secretly share their own supplies for personal satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.
    *   One incident involved a gate being ordered shut to a crowd of desperate civilians, including a small child, an elderly lady, and a man with an amputated leg, while a militant group approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. The soldier defied orders, opened the gate to let the civilians in, and then confronted the armed militants, emphasizing that some calls demand acting according to one's conscience rather than strict rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.
    *   The experience highlighted the difference between welcome [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | challenges]] and unbearable suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.
    *   This experience served as a powerful lesson on the value of water and food, which was later shared with young cadets by showing them real photographs of people drinking cattle urine or collecting drops of blood for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>.

## Life After Military Service
For many, the transition from military to civilian life can be profound. The podcast host shared that after recording an episode with military personnel, he often feels an "exchange of energy" and an "expansion of consciousness," even though he hasn't undergone [[psychological_and_mental_training_in_the_armed_forces | military training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

The true essence of a soldier is not defined by wearing a uniform, but by the attitude and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. One can be a soldier by heart, doing good for the nation as a citizen or student, without ever donning the uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. While some in uniform may not embody the soldier's spirit, many without it possess an amazing attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. This perspective encourages those aspiring to join the forces not to lose heart if they cannot, emphasizing that service is a matter of the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

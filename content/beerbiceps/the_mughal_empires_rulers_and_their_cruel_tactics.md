The Mughal Empire, particularly during the period before the rise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (17th century), was characterized by extreme cruelty and brutality in its rule and internal dynamics. This period saw widespread suffering for the common Indian population due to the empire's exploitative economic policies and the ruthless nature of its leadership and military [00:13:59], [00:21:30], [00:21:41].

## Nature of Mughal Rule

The empire's reach extended across North India with 22 provinces, exercising significant control through a system of military administrators known as Mansabdars [00:37:37], [00:13:59]. Approximately 80% of the Mughal Empire's land was granted to these Mansabdars, who were essentially warriors granted land by the king or sultan [00:07:51]. Their responsibilities included overseeing cultivators, collecting taxes (primarily from the agriculture industry), and maintaining a cavalry force for the emperor [00:07:07], [00:08:04], [00:13:59]. These Mansabdars often functioned as "mini-kings," and the common people in their areas lived in constant fear of them due to their ruthlessness [01:06:39], [01:07:12], [01:07:17], [01:07:20].

Economically, the Mughals extracted vast wealth. From 22 provinces, they collected an estimated 1.2 crore rupees annually, which was in silver coins, each weighing about 10 grams [01:05:02], [01:05:15]. This amount, if converted, would be equivalent to 93,000 kilograms of gold today, valued at approximately $3.5 billion USD [01:05:30], [01:05:39], [01:05:44], [01:05:49]. This wealth was obtained through "sucking the blood and sweat" of cultivators [01:05:56].

The common people of India lived in a constant state of fear and insecurity, especially in North India until the 13th century, and then in the Deccan thereafter [00:21:38], [00:21:41], [00:22:42], [00:23:02], [00:23:37]. Terms like "Sultani Calamity" (raiders) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disaster) became common, reflecting the vulnerability of the populace [00:23:11], [00:23:33]. Children were often taken and sold as slaves [00:23:51], [00:23:57].

## Ruthless Rulers and Their Tactics

The Mughal period was marked by internal conflicts and a brutal approach to power, especially concerning [[mughal_succession_wars_and_internal_conflicts | succession wars and internal conflicts]]. The prevailing mentality for gaining the throne was "either the throne or the grave" [00:39:07], [01:06:03], leading to intense rivalries and fratricide.

### Akbar
Despite popular depictions, Akbar is characterized as a cruel ruler [00:29:26]. Historical accounts suggest he killed some of his subordinates to acquire their women [00:30:18], [00:30:21].

### Salim (Later Jahangir)
Salim, son of Akbar and known from the Anarkali fame, was noted for his extreme cruelty, particularly towards his own son, Khusrau [00:00:00], [00:35:01]. Khusrau, a handsome warrior, was favored by Akbar [00:00:06], [00:35:15]. When Khusrau rebelled against Salim and tried to have Akbar bypass Salim for the throne, Salim tortured him, took out his eyes, and imprisoned him [00:00:16], [00:18:18], [00:35:35], [00:35:53]. To inflict "excruciating pain," salt water was poured into Khusrau's eye sockets [00:00:25], [00:36:45]. Khusrau was later killed by Shah Jahan [00:36:12], [01:01:59].

### Shah Jahan
Shah Jahan killed 36 people, including his own half-brother Khusrau, to secure his claim to the throne [00:36:12], [01:01:59]. He was later imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb [01:00:13].

### Aurangzeb
[[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_mahadev | Aurangzeb]] is depicted as extremely clever and ruthless, using any means necessary to gain and maintain power, including religion [00:41:46], [00:41:54]. His ascent to power involved eliminating his brothers:
*   **Dara Shikho:** The eldest and Shah Jahan's favorite, Dara was an intellectual interested in religious discussions and philosophy [00:45:11], [00:45:30]. Aurangzeb used religious propaganda, labeling Dara as an "idolater" and "non-believer" to garner support from orthodox Mansabdars [00:52:11], [00:56:09], [00:56:19], [00:56:23]. Dara was eventually caught by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, brought back to Delhi, tried under Sharia law, and beheaded for writing a book called "Mingling of Two Oceans" (meeting of two religions), which was considered his biggest crime [01:00:02], [01:00:22], [01:00:44], [01:00:54], [01:01:00].
*   **Murad:** The youngest and a "drunken womanizer" [00:44:30], [01:13:14], Murad was initially manipulated by Aurangzeb, who feigned disinterest in the throne and promised Murad the emperorship [00:52:49], [00:53:50], [00:54:00]. Murad joined Aurangzeb's forces in the war of succession [00:54:14], [00:58:57]. Murad was later imprisoned by Aurangzeb and died of an opium overdose, or was possibly hung after a trial [01:14:57], [01:15:23], [01:15:28].
*   **Shah Shuja:** A "womanizer" sent to Bengal [00:44:25], [00:44:30]. Shah Shuja was driven deep into Bengal by Aurangzeb's forces and was eventually caught and killed by "cannibal people" in Arakan (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma border region), with his entire family reportedly eaten [00:00:34], [01:08:42], [01:09:07], [01:09:10], [01:09:18], [01:09:21].
*   **Suleiman Shikho:** Dara Shikho's son. He was imprisoned in Gwalior fort and killed by being forced to drink opium seeds, leading to addiction and deterioration, dying in his own filth [00:37:16], [00:37:44], [00:37:52], [00:38:05], [01:15:18].
*   **Muhammad Sultan:** Aurangzeb's own first-born son, who joined Shah Shuja, was imprisoned and died of depression at age 36 in Gwalior fort [01:15:01], [01:15:36], [01:15:40], [01:15:43].

Aurangzeb himself was a skilled warrior and politician, having spent his life on the battlefield learning tactics and gaining experience [00:46:54], [00:47:10], [00:47:15], [01:12:49], [01:13:03]. He acquired wealth by squeezing money from states like Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi to strengthen his army [00:51:53], [00:51:56]. His ability to use emotions, ambition, and religion made him a "fantastic politician" [00:58:01], [00:58:08].

## Cruel Military Tactics

The Mughal army was formidable in size, boasting half a million soldiers, and was composed of diverse groups including Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkistanis, Russians, and various Indian groups like Marathas and Rajputs [01:18:56], [01:19:09], [01:19:53], [01:20:29]. There was also internal racial discrimination, with darker-skinned Indian soldiers reportedly paid less than their fairer-skinned counterparts from Central Asia [01:20:39], [01:20:44].

Mughal military tactics included:
*   **Opium-dosed elephants:** In battles, elephants were given opium to make them wild [01:11:02], [01:11:11], [01:11:25]. Iron balls with hundreds of spikes were tied to their trunks [01:11:34], [01:11:38]. These elephants were then unleashed into enemy ranks, causing intentional casualties and fear [01:11:49], [01:12:02].
*   **Torture Chambers:** The Mughals, and also the Portuguese in Goa during the 15th and 16th centuries, employed brutal torture chambers for those who refused to convert or change their lifestyles [00:14:51], [01:47], [01:15:05]. Methods included using sharp instruments to remove feet, and torturing pregnant women [00:15:07], [01:15:15]. These details are explicitly explained in Medha Bhaskar's book, *Challenging Destiny* [00:15:27], [01:15:29].
*   **Poison and Dungeon deaths:** Prisoners were killed through forced consumption of opium seeds, leading to addiction and slow death [00:37:16], [00:37:44], [00:37:52]. Another method involved leaving venomous snakes in dungeons with prisoners and their families [00:38:13], [01:13:27].

The widespread suffering and fear under Mughal rule, stemming from both economic exploitation and the brutal nature of its rulers and military, created a context of vulnerability for the Indian populace before the emergence of leaders like Shivaji Maharaj [01:34], [00:21:30], [00:23:02], [00:23:37], [01:22:37].

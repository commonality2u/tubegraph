The prostate is a small, walnut-sized organ located between the urinary bladder (reservoir) and the urethra (conduit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. Its primary function is to produce semen, which is the fluid that allows sperm to thrive and be carried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This function is controlled by [[mens_psychological_and_physiological_health_relating_to_testosterone | testosterone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:27">[01:59:27]</a>.

## Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
Over time, typically after the fourth decade of life, hormonal changes can occur, specifically an imbalance between estrogen and [[mens_psychological_and_physiological_health_relating_to_testosterone | testosterone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>. This imbalance, often linked to the accumulation of fat in the body and the activity of the aromatase enzyme, can lead to the proliferation of cells within the prostate, causing it to enlarge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. If the prostate's outer shell is not elastic, this enlargement can compress the urethra, leading to various urinary symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

### Symptoms of BPH
*   Frequent desire to pass urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:29">[02:00:29]</a>
*   Urgency (feeling the need to urinate quickly, sometimes leading to leakage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>
*   Delayed stream (difficulty starting urination) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>
*   Prolonged stream (taking a long time to empty the bladder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>
*   Dribbling at the end of urination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>
*   Sense of incomplete evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>

Fortunately, not all men develop clinical symptoms of BPH, even if they have histological (microscopic) changes in their prostate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:20">[02:01:20]</a>. Some men can have significantly enlarged prostates (e.g., 200 grams compared to a normal 20 grams) without experiencing symptoms, if the capsule around the prostate is elastic enough to accommodate the increase in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>.

## Prostate Examinations
Regular [[prostate_examinations_and_health | prostate examinations]] are important.

### Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)
The Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) involves a doctor inserting a finger into the rectum to feel the prostate. If the patient experiences pain during this examination, the fault lies with the doctor, as proper technique (explaining the procedure, making the patient comfortable, lubricating well, and slowly inserting the finger) should prevent discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>.

The DRE is traditionally used to assess for prostate enlargement and to detect prostate cancer, which feels hard like a stone, unlike a normal prostate which feels firm like the tip of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.

### Modern Diagnostic Tools
Today, other tools are available to assess the prostate and reduce the need for DRE for initial diagnosis:
*   **Ultrasound:** Provides information on the prostate's weight, volume, and shape, as well as its effect on the bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Blood Test:** A blood test used to monitor for potential prostate cancer. A normal PSA level generally means a rectal examination is not immediately necessary for cancer exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:42">[02:05:42]</a>. A consistent rise in PSA levels may indicate the need for further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:03">[02:06:03]</a>.
*   **MRI:** Can be used to detect cancer if PSA levels are high and a DRE is inconclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.

A surgeon may still perform a DRE before robotic surgery for prostate cancer to determine if the prostate is stuck to the rectum and if it can be safely removed without damaging the rectum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>.

## Prostate Removal
Many older men may require prostate removal due to severe BPH symptoms or prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

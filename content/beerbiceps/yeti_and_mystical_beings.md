This article explores the experiences and insights of Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader, regarding unusual and mystical beings, including his personal encounter with a Yeti. The discussion also delves into the nature of [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | higher beings]] and their [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | influence]] on human existence.

## Encounter with a Yeti

Shri M's name is frequently associated with discussions about Yetis due to a specific event recounted in his autobiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. While attempting an unconventional route to Kailash with his Guru, he fell ill with a high fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. In a tent, a large, furry figure entered, which Shri M initially mistook for a bear, but it stood upright like a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. The being made an eerie "ee-ee" sound before stuffing a bitter herbal medicine into his mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

Shri M's Guru later explained that this was a Yeti, stating they are "good people" and not to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>. The Yeti's intervention was crucial, as it brought medicine that saved Shri M from the mountain fever, which typically proves fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. The encounter taught Shri M that such living creatures exist in remote mountain and forest regions, despite common disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

## The Existence of [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | Other Beings]]

Shri M asserts that [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | higher beings]] undeniably exist, emphasizing that it's a knowing, not just a belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. He finds it "very funny to think that in this earth there are only human beings," calling it a "very limited way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Just as air exists unseen, so do these [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | other beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.

These [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | beings]] operate on different frequencies of vibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. They may be present in the same physical space as humans but remain imperceptible because their frequencies are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. While some of these [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | beings]] may be aware of humans, many are unconsciously present, just as humans are often unaware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### Ghosts vs. Other Entities

Shri M distinguishes between what people commonly refer to as "ghosts" and other [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | supernatural entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

*   **Ghosts**: These are explained as residual electrical charges left behind when a person dies suddenly, such as in an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. These charges, having taken the shape of the body, might become visible under special circumstances, leading to the perception of a ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. However, Shri M stresses that these residual charges possess no intelligence and cannot intentionally cause harm; any fear they induce is psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.
*   **Possession**: While 90% of perceived [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | possessions]] are psychological diseases, in rare instances, other [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | beings]] can occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. These are not the aforementioned electrical charges, and they need not be demonic; both good and bad invisible [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | entities]] exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

### Angels and Beings from Other Realms

The concept of "angels" or "Farish" aligns with these [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | higher good beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. They are beings from different dimensions who will not become human, nor will humans become them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. There are many species of such [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | beings]] on Earth, and they can also originate from [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | other realms]], even from other universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

## [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | Influence]] and [[the_significance_of_higher_and_lower_beings_in_spirituality | Purpose]] of Mystical Beings

Shri M learned from his Guru that these [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | beings]] are factual and can be very helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. During prayer or meditation, [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | higher beings]] can come and [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | influence]] minds, helping to free them from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Conversely, negative [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | beings]] can increase desires, which can be dangerous for someone on a spiritual path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. In such cases, one can invoke positive energies to negate the negative [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

Thoughts themselves are not solely properties of one's own mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. External circumstances or other [[interaction_with_higher_beings_and_entities | beings]] can infuse thoughts into a person's mind, making it seem like their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. This is why traditional meditation often involves drawing a "protective circle" or invoking deities to keep away external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

## [[nagas_and_their_cultural_significance | Nagas]]

The [[nagas_and_their_cultural_significance | Nagas]], traditionally depicted as hooded serpents, were once a species of [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | beings]] from another realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. In ancient times, they served as teachers, imparting wisdom to humanity, which is why they are still worshipped as symbols of wisdom, and the Kundalini energy is also referred to as [[nagas_and_their_cultural_significance | Naga]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>.

The cobras seen today are considered a "decadent leftover" of that original species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. The original [[nagas_and_their_cultural_significance | Nagas]] largely disappeared back to their realm, Nagaloka, after engaging in relationships with human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. While modern cobras are not as intelligent as their ancient predecessors, they are still more intelligent than other snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. Notably, cobras tend not to bite unless threatened and can recognize individuals in whom the Kundalini energy is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>.

## Dimensions Beyond Human Understanding

Shri M explains that the concept of Shiva represents a dimension beyond human understanding, the ultimate essence of all dimensions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. To grasp such [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | dimensions]], one needs to activate a "special faculty," symbolically referred to as the "third eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Our ordinary sense organs are limited to perceiving the three physical dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

He illustrates this with an analogy of wafer-thin bees in a transparent, vertically divided box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. These bees only perceive two dimensions and cannot cross the transparent wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. However, if a bee sits quietly, it can be "picked up" and placed on the other side, representing being lifted into a higher dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This analogy suggests that one way to access [[higher_beings_and_other_realms | other dimensions]] is through deep meditation and stillness, which allows perception to shift to a higher place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

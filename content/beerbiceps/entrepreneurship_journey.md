Priyanka Chopra Jonas has embarked on a significant entrepreneurial journey, actively engaging in various business ventures alongside her established career in entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Her endeavors reflect a broader shift in perspective towards work, success, and the modern entrepreneurial landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Shifting Perspectives on Work and Success

Priyanka Chopra Jonas's view on work and success has evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
Initially, there was a romanticized notion that working 24 hours a day, without sleep or food, would lead to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. However, with more life experience, she realized the critical importance of [[work_life_balance | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. She emphasizes that work can be a source of joy and creativity, rather than solely a tough and rough endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Maintaining a clear separation between work and personal time, where she focuses on family and relaxation, allows her to return to work rejuvenated and focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

> "Work can be your companion, work can be creative, work can be something that gives you Joy and now I've reached a point where that work life balance for me is most important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Despite being recognized as one of India's biggest success stories in media, she continues to pursue new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Her motivation stems from a deep love for her job and the privilege of being in a position to create in diverse ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. She views her career as a legacy for her children and future generations, refusing to give it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Priyanka Chopra Jonas's Entrepreneurial Path

Her [[early_struggles_in_career | entrepreneurial journey]] began with a pragmatic approach to career longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Production and Investments
Around the age of 30, her mother, herself an entrepreneur, advised her to start planning for her future beyond acting, anticipating a limited shelf life for actresses in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This led her to develop an interest in production and the business of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. She learned about production costs, margins, and making profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

Upon working in America, she became interested in investments, particularly in tech, influenced by her venture capitalist manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. She started with small investments that grew significantly, such as her involvement with Bumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Her partnership with Bumble was instrumental in changing the dating scene in India, especially for women, by creating a safe space where women could make the first move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This experience highlighted for her the power of a new idea and the importance of working with people who can execute those ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

### Founding Anomaly
Anomaly is her first self-founded brand, developed with the support of incubation leaders in the beauty industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The brand focuses on haircare, addressing a gap in the market for affordable, sustainable, and clean products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. Anomaly's packaging is made from 100% recycled trash, including ocean-bound plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. The use of recycled materials allows for a larger budget to be allocated to creating high-quality formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. She also challenged traditional marketing by emphasizing that hair needs are universal, not gender-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. The brand has been successful, selling one product every 7 seconds on Nykaa on its first day and becoming a top 10 haircare brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

## Challenges and Humility in New Ventures

Priyanka Chopra Jonas's journey in America highlights the significant challenges of starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Despite having a successful career in India, it took her 10 years (from 2010 to 2020) to secure her first leading role in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This required immense hard work, consistent effort, and extreme humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

> "It required me to walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself to people to take my show re and say this is the work I have done I would love to work with you I would love to see if there's an opportunity with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

She refutes the narrative that her success in the West was effortless, stressing the "sweat, tears, and blood" it took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Her experience underscores the importance of adapting to a new environment and being willing to start from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

## The Future of Entrepreneurship

She observes a significant shift in the younger [[role_of_entrepreneurship_in_indias_economy | generation (Gen Z)]] towards entrepreneurship, with many aspiring to start their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. This contrasts with her parents' generation, where career choices were largely limited to established professions like doctors, engineers, or lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. She believes that current parents are more open to supporting their children's entrepreneurial ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Priyanka Chopra Jonas offers [[advice_for_aspiring_entrepreneurs | advice for aspiring entrepreneurs]] and young, ambitious women:

*   **Defy traditional molds**: Be fearless and take charge of your own life, rather than fitting into societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Filter out noise**: Ignore negative narratives and people who try to dictate how you should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Boldness makes history**: "Good Girls Don't Make History. Bold Girls Make History" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. Take choices that might be contrary to what you've heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **Self-empowerment**: Empowerment comes from within; if external encouragement is lacking, find it in your "gut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.
*   **Seek inspiration**: Find inspiration from people who motivate you, whether collaborators, public figures, or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Don't just sit with inspiration, think about what you can do to achieve similar feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on achievable steps**: Rather than "unachievable dreams" or waiting for miracles, focus on the "small next dream" or "next step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:52">[03:43:52]</a>. Work backwards from a goal to determine the first actionable step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace aging**: Stressing about aging is futile, as it's an inevitable fact of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:10">[03:26:10]</a>. Focus on who you want to be at your current age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:52">[03:43:52]</a>.
*   **Surround yourself with positive people**: Eliminate toxic individuals and keep only those who are genuinely happy for your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:16">[03:37:16]</a>.

### The "Manufacturer of Gold" Philosophy
She emphasizes that success is not due to an inherent "Midas touch" but the result of sustained hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. For Anomaly, this involved a year and a half of research, testing, and meticulous attention to every detail, from font choices to product smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. The final product appears "gold" because of the immense effort invested in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

> "It's gold because of the work that's gone into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

Her purpose in life is defined by having purpose itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. She believes what one does between birth and death constitutes their legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:13">[04:36:13]</a>. Success is subjective and individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. The pursuit should be focused on one's life purpose and creating what one desires, ultimately making choices that lead to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:13">[04:39:13]</a>.

Womens empowerment and self-confidence are central themes, particularly in the context of breaking traditional molds, achieving professional success, and fostering internal strength. The current generation of women is noted for its fearlessness and ability to take charge of their own lives, influencing the trajectory of their families through the choices they make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Breaking Molds and Societal Expectations

Historically, society has imposed certain narratives and expectations on women, teaching them to be "seen not heard" or dictating how they should present themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. These traditional views suggested that to be a "good girl," one had to conform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. However, the prevailing message for young ambitious women today is to challenge these norms:
> "Good Girls Don't Make History. Bold Girls Make History. So if you want to be the lead actor of the of your movie, which is your life, you've got to take choices that might be contrary to what you've heard." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>

This reflects a shift away from [[youth_selfconfidence_and_societal_expectations]] that constrained previous generations, including the speaker's mother and grandmother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Cultivating Personal Empowerment

True empowerment is described as an internal force that may or may not come from external sources like parents, family, or partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. It stems from one's "gut" and the realization that "no one's going to fix your life but you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. [[developing_confidence_through_selflove_and_selfimprovement | Developing confidence]] involves:
*   **Finding Inspiration:** Seeking inspiration from individuals who motivate you, whether they are collaborators, public figures, or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The key is to not just admire but to "imbibe" and consider "what can I do that'll make me feel how I feel about this person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance:** Moving past the romanticization of relentless work and recognizing the importance of work-life balance for rejuvenation and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Humility:** Remaining grounded and true to oneself, as highlighted by the speaker's mother, who would intervene if arrogance surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Strategic Goal Setting:** Instead of focusing on grand, unachievable dreams, the speaker advocates for focusing on "the small next dream" and taking incremental "steps up the ladder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. This practical approach to [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | achieving goals]] is crucial for building a legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Negativity

The journey of empowerment often involves facing jealousy and attempts to jeopardize one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. The speaker reflects on a perceived Indian mindset of envy towards others' success, possibly a lingering effect of colonial history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. To overcome such obstacles:
*   **Ignore the Noise:** It's essential to "shut off the noise" of negative comments and external opinions that do not align with one's truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on Support:** Instead, focus on the few people who believe in you and the "little sliver of light" of inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Remove Toxic Influences:** Actively remove "poisonous" or "toxic" people from one's life, keeping only those who are genuinely happy for your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Aging:** Combat the anxiety around aging by accepting it as a natural process. The focus should be on "who you want to be" and what opportunities exist at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Examples like Falguni Nayar, who started Nykaa at 50, demonstrate that "age ain't nothing but a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## Personal Journey and [[Personal struggles and growth journey | Growth]]

The speaker's own journey exemplifies these principles. Despite immense success in India, relocating to America meant starting from scratch, requiring extreme humility and consistent effort over 10 years to secure a leading role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This included taking small roles, facing rejection, and adapting to a new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Significantly, it took 21 years of working to finally achieve the same remuneration as a male co-actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

This commitment and perseverance underscore the idea that success is not merely "touching something and it turns to gold," but rather that "it's gold because of the work that's gone into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship and Future Outlook

The rise of entrepreneurship, particularly among Gen Z, signifies a shift from traditional career paths to pursuing innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The speaker's venture into entrepreneurship, particularly with the brand Anomaly, was initially driven by a mother's foresight about the limited shelf life for actresses in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This led to an interest in the business of entertainment, investments (like Bumble, which empowered women in dating by giving them the first step) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, and ultimately founding her own brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

The meaning of life, in this context, is defined by having [[power_of_intuition_in_personal_and_professional_life | purpose]] and creating a legacy between birth and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. While success is subjective, the pursuit should be focused on what one wants to do, who one wants to be, and what one wants to create, ultimately making choices that lead to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

No student genuinely enjoys the process of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]]; most would prefer to relax, watch television, or play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] remains a constant aspect of life that cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. What *can* be changed is one's [[changing_perspective_towards_studying | perspective towards studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Changing Perspective

Instead of viewing [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] as a boring, time-consuming process, it can be approached like a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers, famously stated he "hated every single minute of training," but told himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This same mentality applies to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### The Opponent Within
When [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] for exams or navigating life, the biggest opponent is oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Successful students, though they may also dislike [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]], are not necessarily smarter or more talented; they possess a greater hunger for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Finding this internal hunger is crucial for [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | self-motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Purpose of Study

Rather than aiming to be an average student, it's essential to train and prepare for a championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. [[Studying_for_selfimprovement | Studying]] should not be done for parents, friends, marks, or financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The sole purpose of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] should be for the future version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

By training diligently, one can reach a point where worrying about failure or bad marks becomes unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The goal is to perform like a heavyweight champion, knowing every answer regardless of what the exam paper asks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Embracing Discipline

When faced with the option to skip difficult sections or questions, always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. [[Influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | Discipline]] is defined as choosing between what is desired immediately and what is most desired in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In moments of laziness, when there's a choice between giving less effort or giving 100%, always strive to give 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This effort and [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | motivation]] should stem from deep within, not from external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The ultimate choice lies in deciding whether to be remembered as an average individual who lost personal battles or as someone who achieved greatness in their goals through dedicated [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Achieving a stylish look often comes down to mastering small details, such as how to roll shirt sleeves. There are distinct methods that can add personality and neatness to an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Beer Biceps Sleeve Roll

This technique, also known as the "sicker wave," adds personality and fun to an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. To perform this sleeve roll:
1.  Grab the shirt sleeve by the cuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Pull it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  Use the main part of the sleeve to hold the cuff in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Many shirts are manufactured specifically to be rolled in this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, especially those produced around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A key indicator that a shirt is designed for this roll is if the inner pattern of the sleeve cuff is different from the outside pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The end result is a shirt that looks gorgeous due to these two contrasting elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

While there is a "normal way" of rolling up a shirt by rolling it in layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the "sicker wave" offers a more distinct and stylish approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

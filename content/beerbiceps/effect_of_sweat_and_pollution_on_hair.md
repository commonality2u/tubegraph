Maintaining the quality of your hair involves being aware of [[daily_habits_that_harm_hair_quality | daily habits that can ruin it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two significant environmental factors that can negatively impact hair health are sweat and pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Impact of Sweat on Hair
Sweat, while a natural bodily function, has downsides for hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. It can wash off the scalp's and hair's natural oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Additionally, sweat is a mix of water, natural salts, and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Even if the water dries, these salts and proteins can crust up on the scalp and hair, leading to further dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

To mitigate these effects:
*   **Wash Hair After Sweating** After intense cardio sessions or significant sweating, try washing your hair with [[choosing_the_right_shampoo_for_hair_care | shampoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Schedule Shampooing** Ideally, schedule your shampooing sessions on the same days as your cardio workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **After Swimming** Always wash your hair completely immediately after swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Impact of Pollution on Hair
Pollution is difficult to avoid, especially for those living in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Heavy hair products, such as gels or waxes, can trap pollution, negatively affecting hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

To protect your hair from pollution:
*   **Choose Lighter Hair Products** Opt for lighter hair products like serums, or even better, organic hair creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. These can be used daily without concern for adverse effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Hair Protection** Lighter hair products can also help protect your hair from pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

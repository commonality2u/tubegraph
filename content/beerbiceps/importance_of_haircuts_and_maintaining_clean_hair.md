## Haircuts: The Foundation of Neatness

Haircuts significantly impact your face structure and, more importantly, how scruffy you appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Cut
For many Indian guys who have rough hair, it's generally not advisable to grow out long hair unless it's silky smooth, like John Abraham's used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. To achieve a neat and classy look, opt for the "golden haircut": a slightly long top with slightly short sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Well-known athletes like Virat Kohli, Cristiano Ronaldo, Olivier Giroud, and Robin Van Persie often follow this style, varying the ratios of top length to side length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The key is to find a haircut that perfectly suits your individual face and face structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The most crucial rule is to consistently look neat and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Key takeaway: Looking like you've had a bath and maintaining overall cleanliness is paramount for attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

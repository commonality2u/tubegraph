From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Dr. Savio Fado, a [[astral_realm_and_psychic_phenomena | psychic]] and demonologist, works alongside Sarjit Mohanty and Puja Vijay as part of the PAIRS crew, a team engaged in [[paranormal_investigations_in_india | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Their work, often referred to as [[paranormal_investigations_in_india | paranormal investigations]] and research, focuses on understanding darkness to move towards light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. Unlike typical "ghost hunts," their approach is characterized by a highly [[the_science_and_methodology_of_paranormal_investigations | scientific method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Dr. Savio Fado's Approach and Abilities

As an exorcist, Dr. Fado initially joined the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. He describes himself as a [[the_role_of_skepticism_in_dealing_with_supernatural_phenomena | skeptic]] who questions everything, even during exorcisms or at haunted locations, and doesn't readily believe claims of possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. His diverse skill set includes:
*   Handwriting analysis (graphology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
*   Face reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
*   Behavior analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
*   Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   Hypnotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>

These skills make it difficult to deny that "there is something more, something beyond this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Scouting and Peripheral Audit
Dr. Fado's role involves "scouting" and "peripheral reading" at potential investigation sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Scouting** involves physically assessing the location for any anomalies, whether spiritual or human interference, including potential dangers from people or animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:27]</a>.
*   **Peripheral audit** is a spiritual assessment to determine if a place is truly haunted and worthy of an investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. He emphasizes that not every abandoned place or house with a death is haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Psychometry
Dr. Fado is a psychometric person, meaning he can touch objects and surfaces to "read" information due to nerve endings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. He reads rocks, trees, and other elements to gain answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. These readings, which can include flashes of light, colors, faces, or voices, are then corroborated with facts and the history of the place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. He aims to document these feelings to potentially translate them into technology, such as a laser that could read events from a wall, assisting in crime cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

### Telepathy and Non-Verbal Communication
Through his study of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Dr. Fado believes he learned "soft telepathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. He views NLP as a way to program one's own brain or others', enabling telepathic and non-verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. He can communicate telepathically with [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] by projecting thoughts, using mediums like light, air, water, or fire, as these are all forms of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:11:00">[59:11:00]</a>.

### Aura and Energy Density
Dr. Fado states that meditating and praying fills a room with one's aura, and if the aura is positive enough, its density can drive off other [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>. He maintains a meditative state 24/7 to increase the density of his own aura, shunning off any [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] he senses attempting to get into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>. This means he does not bring [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] home from investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

## Spirituality as the Science of the Paranormal
Dr. Fado's Instagram bio states, "Spirituality is the science of the Paranormal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. He believes that by studying the human body and its more than 20 senses (beyond the traditional five, including senses of balance, hunger, thirst, intimacy, intuition, anxiety, and trauma), humanity can unearth everything and improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. He posits that current science, focused on "gadgetry," overlooks the deeper scientific procedures of human physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## Development of Psychic Abilities
Dr. Fado's [[astral_realm_and_psychic_phenomena | psychic]] abilities developed slowly and steadily, not through a sudden trigger or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. He attributes this to learning various human observation and interaction skills, starting with handwriting analysis from his brother, then face reading, behavior analysis, body language, hypnosis, and eventually NLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. He observed people, noting their attire, walk, and expressions, to understand their thoughts and origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:34]</a>.

## Case Studies and Interactions
### First Exorcism Experience
Dr. Fado's first [[personal_ghost_experiences | paranormal experience]] that convinced him of these phenomena was an exorcism of a friend, handled by his elder brother, who was also an exorcist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. He witnessed a frail young man lift a sofa with one hand, puke, and mouth filthy language, manifesting in a "demonic way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:18:00]</a>. He learned that fear is not an option when dealing with demons, as they feed off negative emotions like anger, anxiety, sadness, and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. Demons (which he defines as any unwanted sickness in the body, mind, or spirit) exploit vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. He asserts that demons are everywhere, and people become susceptible to attachment if there's a "gap in their aura" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

### The Most Challenging Case
Dr. Fado recounted his most challenging case, which involved two boys acting demonically possessed simultaneously and synchronously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. He initially read photographs of the boys, sensing an [[experiences_and_beliefs_about_the_occult_and_paranormal | occult]] presence by reading their aura and finding an imbalance in their faces and body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>. He interacted with the first boy, discerning that the possession was beyond a psychiatric issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. Upon meeting the second boy, who was also in a manic state and trying to harm himself and others, he noticed synchronized behaviors with the first boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.

His [[paranormal_investigations_in_india | paranormal investigation]] revealed that the boys were half-brothers, sharing the same father, who was engaging in pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. The boys' manic phases occurred rhythmically with the father's indulgence in his activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>. Dr. Fado faced a paradox: how to treat the possession without disrupting the family by exposing the father's actions, as the environment needed to be addressed alongside the possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>. The possessions stopped only after the father committed suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:00">[38:54:00]</a>.

### The Most Uncomfortable Location
Dr. Fado considers his own house the "most haunted" due to the collection of "charged" or "haunted objects" he keeps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:15:00">[43:15:00]</a>. These include a large mirror that acts as a portal, potentially allowing "multiple [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] to go in and out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>. He notes that while not all mirrors are portals, they can become so if facing each other, creating an "endless loop" that serves as an entryway for higher-dimensional [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. Natural portals can also form where three or four elements interact, such as water bodies or certain tree formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.

He recounted a case in a dilapidated temple on the outskirts of Mumbai where two dead human [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] were fighting due to a rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. The female [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] outside the temple was turbulent and violent, seeking revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. Dr. Fado telepathically communicated with this [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] a week in advance, which led them to the location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. During the investigation, the [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] physically restrained him by turning feeble creepers into thick branches to block his way, an unusual manifestation that deeply affected him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. This [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] was the mother of a murdered girl who had sought revenge on the killer's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Dr. Fado confirms that powerful [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] can indeed manipulate physical reality, like Poltergeist activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.

### Interactions with [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | Entities]]
Most possessed individuals are unaware of the [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] afflicting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Dr. Fado's work is to identify the specific "demon" (e.g., suicide, depression, past life, dark magic) to then counsel and emancipate the person's spirit and soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. He explains that weaker [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] can cause misfortune, accidents, or family discord without overt physical manifestations, and many people are unaware of their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:02">[01:42:02]</a>.

When [[interactions_with_ghosts_and_entities | interacting with ghosts and entities]], Dr. Fado notes that they look like normal humans, not necessarily scary, as portrayed in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>. They see living humans as any other person and only interact when their presence is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. Entities gather energy from sources like light, air, or plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. While some [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] don't know they are dead, others do but refuse to cross over due to unresolved desires, such as concern for loved ones, property, or a desire for revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. He states that [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] coexist with humans like any other creature, and interventions are only necessary when they become a "pest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

Dr. Fado also explains the difference between a "ghost" (a human who once walked Earth) and a "demon" (a free radical of energy that has never walked Earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. If positive memory is ascribed to energy, it forms angels or spirit guides; if negative, it forms demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. Some [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entities]] can also be "gray" or confused, causing confusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.

He discusses Ouija boards, explaining that they primarily work on the "otor effect" (micro muscles twitching to move the planchet) and draw information from the users' memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>. However, he warns that a Ouija board can potentially invite an [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] if given the opportunity, as any [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | entity]] would want to interact with the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>. Similarly, rituals like "Bloody Mary" only "work" if the participant's intention is to make it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

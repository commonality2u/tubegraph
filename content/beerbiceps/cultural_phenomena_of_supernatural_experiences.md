The speaker shares personal [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]] that have shaped their understanding of the unseen world, stemming from a lifelong curiosity about realities beyond human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This curiosity was amplified by horror movies in childhood, suggesting there might be things beyond what is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Childhood Fears and Sleep Paralysis
Growing up in a building with a family-owned hospital on the ground floor and living on the third floor, the speaker always felt a deep fear of the dark and the sensation of being watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This fear extended to feeling a presence or energy in dark, empty rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The speaker struggled to sleep alone until around 19 or 20 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Around the age of 11, the speaker frequently experienced [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | sleep paralysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | Sleep paralysis]] is described as a scientific phenomenon where one half-wakes up while the brain has paralyzed the muscular system as a protective mechanism during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. During these episodes, individuals are conscious and can open their eyes but cannot move or scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In severe cases, nightmares can blend with reality, confusing the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The most terrifying [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | sleep paralysis]] experience involved waking up in their room and seeing a shadowy figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Unable to scream, the only defense was to close their eyes and hope to fall back asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In a specific incident while sleeping next to their mother, the speaker felt "shadowy creatures" chaining them to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. These creatures seemed to welcome a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A woman with pale, torn skin, blisters, untidy hair, and one visible "pale red eye" then appeared, sitting on the speaker's chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The speaker felt her weight and fingers, unable to move or scream despite seeing their mother nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Cross-Cultural Parallels and Theories
Two years after this experience, at age 13, the speaker watched a National Geographic show about alien abductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The show featured a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon where [[Cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits | sleep paralysis]] is accompanied by a "witch" sitting on top of the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. One theory presented was that aliens simulate this experience, creating the imagery of a woman sitting on the human to conduct experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The visual representation of this phenomenon on the show exactly matched what the speaker had seen: the same woman, single staring eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, untidy clothes, and pale, dead eyes staring with "nothingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This discovery deeply disturbed the speaker, causing them to cry and struggle with sleeping alone for the next 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Spiritual Combat and Overcoming Fear
The speaker eventually overcame this phobia by discovering [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | Spirituality]], beyond meditation and karma, addresses the spirit world, astral world, [[demonic possession and exorcism | dark energies]], and [[demonic possession and exorcism | demons]], and how to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Inspired by "The Autobiography of a Yogi," which states that fear ceases to exist when stared in the eye, the speaker worked on strengthening their "spiritual muscle of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

During their [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | sleep paralysis]] episode, the speaker's spiritual mother had taught them a mantra ("Om Nam") to ward off [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | bad spirits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In that moment, the speaker closed their eyes and repeated the mantra until they fell asleep, still feeling the weight but trusting the mantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Upon waking, the presence was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Later in life, around age 22-23, the speaker began meditating frequently with their co-founder, Rajas, often in darkness for deeper experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. During one late-night meditation in their building's garage, they both sensed an "extremely dark" energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Recalling the lesson to face fear, the speaker continued meditating and repeated the "Om Nam" mantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. They both felt they had pushed out a negative energy from the room and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Corroborating Accounts and Resolution
A psychic friend, who visited their office in the same building, immediately went to the end of a corridor without being prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This specific room was directly below the speaker's mother's room where the "witch incident" had occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The psychic stated that the room contained a lot of "dark energy" and had been home to a "[[demonic possession and exorcism | demon]] or a [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | ghost]]", suggesting that their meditation practices had likely pushed it out by making the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Further corroboration came from the speaker's grandfather, the owner of the building, who had run the hospital since the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. He reported that over 50 years, patients in those very rooms had occasionally felt a woman sitting on their chest at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Some patients even reported being pushed off their hospital beds by a "flash of a really scary looking woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. These occurrences were directly beneath the location of the speaker's own childhood experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The hospital is now defunct, and the negative presence is no longer felt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Since the psychic's examination, pujas, havans, and candle lighting have been performed in the building to make the environment positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The speaker's deep embrace of [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | spirituality]] is rooted in their lifelong experience with the fear of unseen entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This profound fear of the dark was not merely the absence of light but the fear of an entity that felt like it was always watching, until the speaker learned to face it and push it out through positive spiritual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The speaker acknowledges having had many other [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]] not yet shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. They believe that spiritual practices help combat the [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Karma is directly connected to time, as time controls karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is a part of nature and cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. Just as one might carry an umbrella in the rain, karmic lessons are virtues to be inculcated mentally and emotionally to handle situations better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

Karma itself cannot be changed, but it can be balanced or released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.
*   **Balancing Karma** occurs when you go through what you've done, often with the same person involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
*   **Releasing Karma** involves experiencing a similar emotion but in a different situation, often through a cosmic exchange that may not involve the same people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>. For example, if you cheated someone out of money, you might lose the same amount, and the other person finds it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

## Akashic Records and Life Plans

An [[Understanding soul connections and karmic relationships | akashic record]] is the sum totality of all a soul's experiences across all lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. It serves as a book of records storing information about past journeys, partners, parents, children, virtues, and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

Before birth, souls create a master plan or "blueprint" based on their [[Karmic lessons and reincarnation | karmic aaric records]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. This energetic blueprint, in an energy language, outlines the lessons to be learned and the people to meet to advance vibrationally towards "closest to God" or ascension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

Upon human birth, distractions like religion, society, upbringing, traumas, and pressure to make money cause individuals to forget their soul's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. However, the soul remembers and constantly nudges through intuition, which is the voice of the soul guiding us according to this blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

## Types of Karmic Interactions

Akashic records can be broken down into three parts:

### Karmic Contracts
These are symbiotic relationships people enter into with parents, partners, colleagues, employees, teachers, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. They involve adding something to each other's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. These relationships are often eternal, with people reconnecting years later to fulfill the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

### Karmic Lessons
These relationships are short-lived and serve to teach an individual a specific lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. If the lesson is learned, the person or type of energy will not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. If not learned, the lesson will reappear in a harsher way, leading to repeated patterns like attracting abusive partners or toxic bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. Self-forgiveness is often a crucial lesson to learn in these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

### Karmic Incompletions
These are aspects left unfinished in previous lifetimes that a soul may choose to complete in the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. However, souls do not simply repeat past actions; they pick up new contracts and lessons to foster evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

## Free Will and Destiny

Destiny is not solely predestined; it is a combination of [[karma_and_predestined_life_paths | karma]] and the choices made through [[the_role_of_karma_free_will_and_destiny_in_spiritual_life | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>. For example, if three people are given the same opportunity, their individual choices (investing wisely, spending on luxury, etc.) determine their differing destinies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

While karma ensures that individuals must eventually clean up any "mess" they create, one can delay dealing with it. This delay might result in dealing with the consequences later through terminal illness or multiple heartbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

## Exit Points and Reincarnation

Every soul is allotted five "exit points" or periods of potential death during a human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. These can occur at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. A soul can choose to take an exit point and release, or continue and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. If a soul skips an exit point and chooses to stay on Earth, their sufferings and challenges will increase, as the universe gives them "more homework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. The body becoming vegetative is an example of a soul clinging to life past its fifth exit point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

Accidental deaths are often self-chosen exit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. Souls of high frequency often know when their exit point is approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.

Souls who commit suicide are considered to have committed the "worst form of sin" for the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>. They do not attain spiritual light and remain stuck in the astral realm for extended periods, experiencing suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>.

Reincarnation is a process where souls return to learn lessons and work on weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>. The more highly vibrating a soul is, the more choices it gets regarding reincarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:41">[02:11:41]</a>. Souls with low vibrational frequencies do not have a choice and are sent back to learn until they master their lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. This includes murderers, rapists, and those who shun life or engage in destructive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>.

A human can be reborn as an animal, which is considered a spiritual demotion, though it can also be a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a>. Conversely, an animal can incarnate as a human, but it must follow a hierarchy, such as a tiger evolving to a cat, then a dog, before becoming a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>. Dogs are seen as the closest animal to human energy, while cats are very powerful spiritually and can absorb negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

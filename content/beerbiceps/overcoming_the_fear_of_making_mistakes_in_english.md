Improving spoken English, speaking with confidence, and enhancing communication skills are among the most frequently requested topics [00:00:00] [00:00:07]. The journey to [[building_confidence_in_english_speaking | English fluency]] doesn't necessarily require a vast vocabulary, but rather clarity of thought and confidence [00:00:25]. The same simple tricks used to improve other languages, such as Hindi, can be applied to English [00:00:37] [00:00:40]. The key is to make the learning process easy and enjoyable [00:00:46] [00:01:06].

## Embracing Mistakes and Putting Ego Aside

A significant step in [[steps_to_improve_spoken_english | improving spoken English]] is to [[overcoming_criticism_and_selfimprovement | put your ego on the side]] [00:03:57] [00:04:26]. In Indian society, there's often an association between speaking English and intelligence, leading to people judging others' English skills [00:04:00] [00:04:06]. However, when someone makes fun of another's English, it often reflects their own insecurity and is a way for them to boost their own ego [00:04:14] [00:04:20].

It is "perfectly alright" to make mistakes while speaking English [00:04:31] [00:04:33]. In fact, if people point out your mistakes, you are likely to remember them, which helps your English improve in the process [00:04:35] [00:04:37] [00:04:38]. The focus should be on becoming the best version of yourself, rather than worrying about what others think [00:04:42] [00:04:44]. [[failures_as_learning_experiences | Embracing mistakes]] and letting go of arrogance are crucial [00:04:29] [00:04:30].

## Cultivating Clarity of Thought

Many people are concerned about speaking English due to worries about what others will think ("log kahenge") and the mental translation process from their native language [00:05:01] [00:05:04] [00:05:06]. To overcome these "bad factors" and achieve [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | clarity of thought]], meditation is recommended [00:05:11] [00:05:13] [00:05:15]. Meditation can clear the mind and ground one's thought process, which is beneficial for every life skill [00:05:22] [00:05:24] [00:05:26] [00:05:33].

## Reevaluating the Importance of English

It is important to [[reevaluating_the_importance_of_english_in_indian_society | stop giving English undue importance]] [00:05:40] [00:05:42]. The perception in Indian society that English is associated with intelligence is a "flaw" inherited from 200 years of British rule [00:05:43] [00:05:46] [00:05:51] [00:05:54]. This mentality is largely absent in other countries where people primarily speak their native languages, such as German in Germany or Japanese in Japan [00:05:57] [00:06:00] [00:06:02] [00:06:04].

Individuals should be proud of their own culture and language [00:06:31] [00:06:33]. Not being able to speak English perfectly is "really not that big a deal" [00:06:36]. If you get stuck while speaking English, it is acceptable to complete your sentences in Hindi [00:06:38] [00:06:41].

When considering how to dress better, understanding different shirt collar styles and their benefits is crucial, as the collar is a prominent feature noticed in the face and neck region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. A well-defined collar contributes to a neat-looking shirt, which is a hallmark of a great shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Button-Down Collar

A button-down collar is characterized by the collar points being held stiff and upright by two small buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### Benefits:
*   **Personality:** These buttons add an element of personality to your dressing, especially if they contrast with the shirt fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Neatness:** The primary function of the buttons is to keep the collar upright and in place, leading to a neat appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

It is recommended to seek out button-down shirts when shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Stiff and Strong Collars

If a button-down shirt is not available, look for shirts with an "extremely stiff and strong looking collar" that will withstand the test of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Collar Stays

For shirts with weaker collars, collar stays can be used to maintain their shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. These are double-sided sticky tapes that can be placed under the shirt collar to hold it in position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

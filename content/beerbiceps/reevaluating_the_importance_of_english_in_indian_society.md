In Indian society, English is often associated with intelligence, a perception that needs to be reevaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This perspective is considered a major "flair" or issue within the society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Historical Context

The association of English with intelligence is largely a remnant of the [[influence_of_colonization_on_indian_history | British rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Two hundred years of British rule instilled this idea into the minds of Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, this is considered a very wrong mentality to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Societal Perceptions and Judgment

Many Indians tend to judge others' English proficiency very easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This judgmental behavior is often a reflection of their own insecurities rather than a critique of the other person's English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. If someone mocks another's English, it suggests they are conscious about their own English, using it as a way to boost their ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The older generation, particularly parents, often express concern if someone cannot speak English well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## A Global Perspective

Unlike India, other countries do not typically prioritize a foreign language in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For example, people in Germany speak German, and people in Japan speak Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In India, people should ideally be speaking their native languages such as Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Modern Attitudes and Recommendations

There's a growing acceptance among the younger generation in India for incorporating Hindi into English conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

It is advised to stop giving English excessive importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Individuals should be proud of their own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. If one struggles with English, it's not a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If one gets stuck while speaking English, it is acceptable to complete sentences in Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This reflects a [[cultural_observations_and_societal_changes | societal change]] towards embracing multilingualism more openly.

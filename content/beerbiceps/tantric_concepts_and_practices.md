This article explores various concepts and practices within the [[tantra_and_its_practices|Tantric]] tradition, including the nature of spiritual entities, methods of protection, the role of spiritual guidance, and the broader understanding of reality.

## Understanding the Spiritual Realm

The discussion touches upon the existence of different planes of existence and the beings that inhabit them. The physical body, astral body, and causal body exist on different planes that are present all around us, overlapping with our physical realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>.

### Entities in the Astral Plane
The astral plane contains various types of beings, some of whom may be considered harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:08">[04:11:08]</a>. These entities can come into contact with practitioners for various reasons, including interference with deep spiritual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:41">[09:32:41]</a>. It is their nature to cause disturbance and they may feed on this disruption in people's spiritual journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:41">[10:09:41]</a>.

The hierarchy of negative entities includes:

*   **Bhoots (Discarnate Entities)**
    *   Bhoots are entities without a physical body, sometimes remnants of those who were once alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:09">[36:16:09]</a>. They retain human-like tendencies such as hunger, anger, or lust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:39">[36:34:39]</a>.
    *   They often remain trapped in this plane, unable to progress further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:14">[36:47:14]</a>.
    *   If agitated, they can cause trouble to those in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:57:09">[36:57:09]</a>.
    *   Their knowledge can be as limited as human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:43">[39:01:43]</a>.
    *   Ancestors (*pitrus*) who are dead but stuck in a realm called Pitru Loka (part of the astral plane) can also cause problems for their living descendants, often unconsciously, due to unfulfilled desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:07">[39:19:07]</a>.
    *   For such ancestors, rituals like offering *pindadan* (rice balls) and specific mantras are performed in sacred places like Trimbakeshwar (Nashik), Gaya, Kashi, or Badrinath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:23">[40:00:23]</a>.
    *   Some entities may not even realize they are discarnate after death due to the shock of transitioning from the physical plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:10">[41:04:10]</a>.

*   **Pishachas**
    *   These are more dangerous and angry spirits than Bhoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:09">[55:46:09]</a>.
    *   Many Pishachas were never incarnated as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:52:08">[55:52:08]</a>.
    *   **Brahma Pishacha**: A specific type of Pishacha that was once a highly knowledgeable human in spiritual matters but misused their knowledge or became greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:04">[55:58:04]</a>.
    *   Pishachas are confined to specific areas with extreme negative energy, often associated with foul odors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:33:48">[58:33:48]</a>.
    *   They are unreasonable and irrational, seeking to influence and gain attention by causing disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:07">[59:31:07]</a>.
    *   They can cause physical harm, diseases, obstructions, and accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:49">[51:17:49]</a>.
    *   They can also enter and cause harm in dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:45:00">[52:45:00]</a>.
    *   Higher deity *upasana* (worship) creates a vibration that Pishachas dislike, causing them to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:33:04">[57:33:04]</a>.
    *   "Jins" in other cultures might be a broad term encompassing Bhoots and Pishachas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:09">[57:57:09]</a>.

*   **Rakshasas and Asuras**
    *   These are considered the highest and most powerful negative entities in Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:08">[11:50:08]</a>.
    *   They are unlikely to incarnate physically in the current era due to the lack of human capacity to withstand their immense raw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.
    *   However, they can influence people's minds from their own planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. An example given is Sri Aurobindo's belief that Hitler was influenced by an Asura due to the vast destruction he caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
    *   Asuras possess exceptional intelligence and are masters of logic and intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
    *   Unlike atheists, Asuras are not non-believers; they fully acknowledge the existence of Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. They are often terrific *upasakas* and exceptional practitioners who misuse their acquired powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
    *   Asuras live in realms where time moves very slowly compared to the human realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
    *   Stories like Devi Mahatmyam describe battles where Asuras fought deities for hundreds of years, sometimes gaining blessings from Gods themselves (e.g., Mahishasura) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
    *   In the second Kalpa, Mahishasura, as an *upasaka*, saw his impending death by the Goddess Bhadrakali and asked for the blessing that his image would always be depicted with the Goddess's foot on him during Durga *upasana*, thus gaining a form of immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.
    *   Anyone who dies at the hands of the Great Gods is believed to be liberated (*mukti*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

## Practices for Spiritual Protection and Progress
[[the_practice_of_tantra_and_its_different_paths|Tantric practices]] emphasize protection and conscious spiritual evolution.

### Upasana (Worship) and Mantra Japa
*   **Importance of Upasana**: Doing *upasana* (worship) of the main deity is crucial for protection against negative entities and forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Mantra Sadhana**: Chanting mantras, like the Mantra Sadhana of Matangi, can build a protective spiritual force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:58">[06:36:58]</a>. The force of a mantra can dispel disturbances caused by negative entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:01">[08:32:01]</a>.
*   **Hanuman Chalisa**: Considered a "superb thing" in [[tantra_and_its_practices|Tantra]], the Hanuman Chalisa has "anti-ghost power" due to Hanuman's nature as an immortal protector deity who responds quickly to pleas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:05">[44:06:05]</a>. Hanuman is one of the 52 VÄ«ras (powerful protective entities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:35:05">[45:35:05]</a>.
    *   **Hanuman Chalisa Upasana**: A person can perform a 40-day *upasana* by chanting the Hanuman Chalisa 51, 54, or 100 times daily, maintaining celibacy, offering *bhog* (food offerings), and meditating on the name of Lord Rama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. This practice can lead to a transformative experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>.

### Meditation and Spiritualization
*   The more one meditates and spiritualizes, the more protection one gains from darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.
*   Meditation not only protects the mind long-term and keeps one stable but also provides protection in "dark moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.

## The Role of Deities and Divine Interaction
[[the_role_of_deities_in_tantra_and_spiritual_evolution|Deities]] are central to [[tantra_and_its_practices|Tantric]] practices.

*   **Divine Intervention**: When a deity interacts with a practitioner who has reached a high state, their primary aim is to transform the individual into something more spiritual, leading to higher zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>.
*   **Readiness for Divine Energy**: The process of *upasana* prepares the mind and body to handle the tremendous energy of a deity without being rattled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. If a 40-watt bulb receives 100,000 watts, it will crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Transformative Encounters**: While some people may see deities without any personal transformation, true transformative experiences, like that of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa seeing Mahakali, change a person completely into a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Purity of Intention**: Deities will not enter a place that is not pure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

## The Importance of a Guru (Spiritual Teacher)
The guidance of a genuine Guru is paramount in [[tantra_and_its_practices|Tantric]] and spiritual paths.

*   **Guidance and Protection**: A Guru holds your hand, corrects, and guides you on what to take seriously and what not to get attached to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Lineage (Guru Parampara)**: In [[tantra_and_its_practices|Tantra]] especially, it is crucial to know the Guru's Guru and the Guru's Guru's Guru (three generations of accomplished gurus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This ensures connection to an entire spiritual ecosystem (*Kula* or *Sampradaya*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Tarpana to Gurus**: In [[practices_and_methods_in_tantra|Tantric]] *upasana*, performing *tarpanam* (a ritual offering for satisfaction) to the three generations of gurus is vital to invoke their blessings, protection, and ensure the right knowledge is passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying a Guru**: It is important to take time to find a Guru, observing if their words and energy resonate with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Rejecting curiosity-driven pursuits in this domain is advised, as formal training and destiny are usually prerequisites for engaging with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Skepticism and Experience
Addressing skepticism about spiritual phenomena is a key point in the discussion.

*   **Experience Over Argument**: It is difficult to convince a skeptic through argument, as their mind may be set against belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Experience as Proof**: An individual's direct experience, especially a negative one outside the normal realm of existence, can drastically change their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Seeking Genuine Experiences**: For those with an agnostic viewpoint (open to evidence), going out and meeting people can lead to encountering genuine spiritual experiences that cannot be explained rationally, even after encountering frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The speaker shares a personal account of a divine experience that changed his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Karma and the Path
*   **Karmic Repercussions**: Any application of power, whether positive or negative, has karmic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. There are no "free lunches" in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   **Desire and Motivation**: Black magic or negative *prayogs* (applications of power) originate from the human heart's desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Secret motivations, rather than verbal expressions, are what deities perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.
*   **Consequence of Material Ambition**: Using spiritual practices for purely material ambition incurs a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. For example, if a powerful Mahavidya *prayoga* is done to cure someone, the practitioner may face an injury or other issue as a balancing act of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.
*   **Divine Permission**: At the highest stages of [[the_practice_of_tantra_and_its_different_paths|Sadhana]], if a deity grants permission for an action, they take care of the associated karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
*   **Wealth and Asuric Influence**: Extreme amounts of wealth can carry an Asuric influence, compelling individuals to engage in unrighteous or negative actions to protect or maintain it, opening a gateway to negative karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.

## Planes of Existence and the Cosmos
*   **Astral and Causal Planes**: The astral plane exists concurrently with the physical plane, like one piece of paper atop another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:08">[37:05:08]</a>. The causal plane is much higher and beyond the immediate concerns of astral entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>.
*   **Space and Time**: There is a yogic dictum: "*Yatha Pinde Tatha Brahmande*" (Whatever is in the universe is also in the body) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. This means the structure of the body (physical, astral, causal) is reflected in space.
*   **Divine Control**: Mahakal Shiva is associated with controlling and holding time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>, while Lord Vishnu is associated with controlling and holding space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43">[01:25:43]</a>.
*   **Internal Space**: Through deep yogic practices, one can access an inner "space" deep within the heart, which is pure enough to hold the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.
*   **Kundalini and Knots**: [[kundalini_and_kriya_yoga|Kundalini]] awakening can pierce "knots" (granthis) like the Vishnu Granthi, allowing one to experience this internal space and bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. Piercing the Rudra Granthi allows one to go beyond time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.
*   **Ultimate Protection**: An individual who has activated these internal states (opened the Vishnu or Rudra granthis) is protected, even if standing amidst a hundred Asuras, as their protection is divine and different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>.
*   **Transformation through Isolation**: Solitary confinement and intense spiritual practice can lead to profound transformations, as demonstrated by Sri Aurobindo's experiences of Krishna while in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.

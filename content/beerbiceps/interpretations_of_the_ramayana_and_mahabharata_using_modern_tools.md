Nes O. offers an evidence-based and scientific approach to interpreting ancient Indian scriptures, specifically the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] and [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. This methodology challenges conventional academic perspectives and "extreme right-wing portals" by grounding ancient narratives in geological, astronomical, and archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

## Re-Dating Ancient Indian Epics

Contrary to prevalent assumptions, the timelines of the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] and [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] are placed significantly further back in history based on astronomical and other evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>:
*   The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] occurred more than 7,000 years ago, specifically dated to 5561 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] occurred more than 14,000 years ago, specifically dated to 12,209 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   The Rigveda dates back more than 21,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The concept of Yugas, commonly understood as fixed chronological periods, is complex and has multiple definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>:
*   **Action-based Yugas:** A Brahman text linked to the Rigveda defines Yugas based on one's actions, e.g., sleeping (Kalyuga), sitting up (Dwaparayuga), standing up (Tretayuga), and walking/acting (Satyayuga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Emotional State Yugas:** Similar to Einstein's theory of relativity, a Yuga can be experienced as a minute or an hour depending on one's emotional state, as described by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Mathematical/Astronomical Formulations:** The common 432,000-year cycle for Kalyuga is a mathematical formulation for precise orbital periods of planets, not directly related to the chronological Yugas of the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] and [[cultural_and_historical_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Calendrical Yuga:** A five-year Yuga used in calendrical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] also defines Yuga based on governance, stating that a particular type of Yuga arises depending on how a king or administrator governs the kingdom ("Raja Kalam") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Reinterpreting Mythological Beings and Places

Nes O. suggests that figures often described as mythical beings in the epics could be interpreted as human beings with extraordinary abilities or from different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>:
*   **Rakshasas:** Figures like Hidimba and Bakasura are suggested to be powerful human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. The term "Rakshasa" itself, derived from Sanskrit, can mean "one who protects," and its negative connotation may have evolved over time due to corruption of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Ravana, for example, is described as a virtuous king and descendant of a sage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:52">[02:19:52]</a>.
*   **Asuras and Devas:** A comparison with Zoroastrianism highlights how "Deva" is villainous in their mythology while "Asura" is noble, opposite to Indian mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This suggests ancient warring tribes where the portrayal of these groups shifted. In the Rigveda, "Asura" was often eulogized, and Indra was even called "Asura" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Geographical Locations:
*   **Utarakuru (Northern Kuru):** Identified as the land of Asuras/Devas, located in Central Asia (Iran, Northern Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan), not [[concept_of_vimanas_in_ancient_texts | Patal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This region was known to the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] even 14,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_vimanas_in_ancient_texts | Patal]]:** Identified with South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
    *   The Puranas describe King Bali's journey to Patal and the establishment of colonies like Sutala and Atala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.
    *   South American legends speak of a civilizer named Virochana/Viracocha, similar to Bali's great-grandfather Virochana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>.
    *   The Aztec people of Mexico are linked to the Indian Sage Astika and the Nagas, who possibly migrated with King Bali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>.
    *   Valmiki's [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] contains precise geographical descriptions, as seen in Sugriva's Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:43">[03:05:43]</a>. When describing the East, it leads to the Andes region, mentioning a "Trishul-like," "gold shining," "yellow-colored," 800-foot tall "pillar" with a rectangular base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This perfectly matches the "Candelabra of Andes" in Peru, a geoglyph whose origin is unknown to locals but described in the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] as established by Indra to mark the end of the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] also describes "horrifying and merciless demons" (Rakshasas) dangling upside down from mountain peaks, resembling "mountain in size" and "ash color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This description closely matches giant vampire bats, which are primarily found in South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Global Geographical Extent of Ancient Indian Knowledge

Sugriva's Atlas in the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of global geography 14,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>:
*   **East Direction:** From India, landmarks extend through Thailand (land of silver), Java (Yavadweep, land of grains), and other islands, across the Pacific Ocean, reaching the Andes region of South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **North Direction:** From India, it describes the Kailash area, the "land of many rivers" (Western China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, known as Utarakuru and Utaramadra), and beyond, extending to the Arctic Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. It warns against going further due to difficult conditions, aligning with the Ice Age conditions and features like the Aurora Borealis ("Northern Lights") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **South Direction:** Descriptions extend from Lanka all the way to Antarctica, which was "discovered" by Europeans only in the 18th century, yet ancient maps like the 15th-century Piri Reis map show detailed Antarctic landmasses, potentially drawn from ancient Indian knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **West Direction:** From India, it traces a path through Saurashtra, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Romania, describing mountain ranges up to the Alps (called "Astagiri") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Catastrophic Sea Level Rise and Submerged Cities

Modern geological data supports the narratives of ancient cities being submerged due to rapid sea level changes:
*   **Catastrophic Rise Events (CREs):** Research by Paul Blanchon on "Reef Drowning during the Last Glaciation" highlights periods of sudden, massive sea level rises, distinct from gradual global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. These events are caused by large blocks of ice cracking and falling during de-glaciation, leading to immediate increases in water levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

*   **Ravana's Lanka:** The modern island of Sri Lanka was not Ravana's Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Ravana's Lanka was located east of the Maldives, an area that is now deep ocean with an unusually thin Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. A catastrophic sea level rise event (S1) around 14,200 years ago (12,209 BC), concurrent with the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] era, saw a 13.5-meter sea level increase, which may have submerged the original Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

*   **[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]]'s Dwarka:** The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] text describes [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]]'s Dwarka being flooded by gushing sea waters 36 years after the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. This dates the event to 5525 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. Geological data from the Arabian Sea confirms a sudden 15-meter sea level rise (CRE3) in the middle of the 6th millennium BC (around 5500 BC), directly correlating with Dwarka's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. This catastrophic event is evidenced in over 30 different locations globally, though the local impact varied due to land subsidence and tectonic plate dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Researchers like Graham Hancock and Glen Mil's work on Dwarka's disappearance also align with the 5525 BC timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.

*   **Plato's Atlantis:** The submergence of Atlantis, which Plato stated happened 9,000 years before his time (around 11,000 years ago from today), aligns with a significant Catastrophic Rise Event (CRE2) occurring at 11.5 Ka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This event falls between the periods of the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]] and [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The formation of the Black Sea, for instance, also dates back to 5525 BC, caused by a sudden influx of salty water from the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus Channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

This evidence-based approach encourages a re-evaluation of [[indian_mythology_versus_history | Indian mythology versus history]], proposing that these ancient texts contain accurate historical and geographical data often overlooked by conventional academia due to preconceived notions about the age of human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

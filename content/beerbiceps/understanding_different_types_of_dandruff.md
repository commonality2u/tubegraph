Dandruff is a common scalp condition, but it's important to understand that not all dandruff is the same. There are primarily two kinds of dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How Dandruff Forms

Dandruff forms because the scalp is a very active environment, constantly producing and shedding skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If the scalp is also very oily, these dead skin cells can collect and mix with the oil, forming the characteristic white flakes that fall off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Types of Dandruff

### Common Dandruff (White Flakes)
The first kind of dandruff is characterized by white flakes that simply fall off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While often perceived as an embarrassing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, this type is generally not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For most individuals, this common form of dandruff can be managed and cured with specific [[hair_care_practices_and_their_impact_on_dandruff | hair care practices]], maintaining a clean [[importance_of_maintaining_a_clean_environment_for_dandruff_control | environment]], employing [[role_of_home_remedies_in_treating_dandruff | home remedies]], and using [[use_of_organic_shampoos_for_dandruff_treatment | organic anti-dandruff shampoos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Soric Dermatitis (Severe Dandruff)
The second, more severe type of dandruff is called Soric Dermatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. In addition to white flakes, this condition is accompanied by severe itching in the scalp region, as well as areas around the hairline and ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Individuals suffering from Soric Dermatitis may also experience boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suspect you have Soric Dermatitis, it is crucial to consult a dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

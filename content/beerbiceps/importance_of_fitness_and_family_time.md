## The Power of Passion and Action

He advises that if one is truly sure about an idea, they should "take that risk" and "just go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

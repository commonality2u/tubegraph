Adrenaline and noradrenaline are a group of hormones referred to as "fight or flight" hormones, which are involved in the [[Intermittent fasting | intermittent fasting]] (IF) diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Role in "Fight or Flight" Response
When faced with a perceived threat, such as a dog attack, the body automatically releases a significant amount of these hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Their primary function is to prepare the body to confront a difficult situation where one is forced to either fight or run away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Impact on the Body
These hormones influence the body in several key ways:
*   **Increased Metabolism** They significantly increase the body's metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Alertness** Adrenaline and noradrenaline make an individual highly alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This effect is comparable to receiving a shot of caffeine or a natural pre-workout, leading to a feeling of being "charged up" when their levels are elevated in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Improved Reflexes and Well-being** These hormones also contribute to improved reflexes and a general sense of feeling good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Intermittent Fasting and Hormone Levels
[[Intermittent fasting | Intermittent fasting]] has been shown to increase the levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This increase occurs to a point where the individual remains healthy while also experiencing enhanced alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

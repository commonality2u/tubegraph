R. Madhavan is currently focused on the release of his new movie, *Shaitan*, which is now in theaters and has surpassed expectations [03:31:40]. He describes *Shaitan* as a very dark, twisted, and intriguing psychological thriller [07:07:44].

## Career Journey and Personal Evolution
Madhavan believes that a movie dramatically changed the direction of his life: *Rocketry* [03:53:07]. This film helped him understand who he truly is and what he is capable of, something he had "far underestimated" before [04:47:49]. He took on multiple roles for *Rocketry*, including writing the script and screenplay for the first time [05:23:44]. He also produced, directed, and acted in the film, which was shot in three languages with live sound in eight locations worldwide [06:14:15]. Taking on the role of director was particularly daunting, feeling "horrifying" given his lack of prior experience in commanding a set or even editing a small reel [06:49:03]. He felt like he was "picked up and thrown in the deep end" [06:39:27].

Madhavan describes the experience of being on set with 150 people ready to pass judgment as one of "mania and fear" [06:51:30]. He nearly gave up before the first shot of *Rocketry*, feeling like Arjuna before Krishna [07:19:07]. A friend's advice to take one step at a time, one shot at a time, helped him push through [08:00:23]. This experience taught him the biggest lesson in stress management: to focus on the immediate next step [08:30:17]. He intentionally chooses paths of "most resistance" because he is "not ready to retire" [09:19:07]. He believes conquering big problems makes smaller ones irrelevant [09:27:54].

His debut Hindi film, *Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein*, was initially considered a flop and was "completely brushed under the carpet" [01:31:18]. However, it slowly gained recognition, reaching its "zenith of recognition" three years after its release and becoming an "iconic film" [01:32:00].

## Childhood and Upbringing
Madhavan describes his childhood as "most blessed," despite its challenges and "trauma" [09:48:07]. He considers "trauma and childhood stress" to be very important for growth [09:56:56]. His childhood traumas included not having a bicycle like his friends or having to wait for his mother to return home to eat, as his parents did not want him to grow up privileged [01:02:18]. He was also judged by society, being called the "shaitan" (devil) of the neighborhood because he used profanities, climbed trees, and petted stray dogs [01:08:44].

Madhavan believes "middle class attitude is the best attitude for survival" [01:21:20]. He observes that successful individuals born in the 1970s and 1980s in India share a common trait of humility, not dwelling on small achievements or showing off their wealth [01:22:53]. This attitude fosters situational awareness and adaptability [01:31:31].

## Views on Society, Generations, and Mental Health
Madhavan expresses concern for the younger generation, believing they are living in loneliness despite being more connected globally than previous generations [01:23:50]. He notes that while Gen Z is "far wiser" and more frugal, they are bombarded with irrelevant information, leading to mental health challenges [02:54:19]. He sees this information overload as a factor that can "fragment a society" by creating confusion and disdain, making people lose situational awareness [02:49:10].

He reflects on the increasing loneliness among people in their 40s, attributing it to the rapid changes brought by social media and the "new age concepts" that alter personal conditioning [03:00:50]. Madhavan notes that traditional roles and expectations within relationships have shifted, leading to misunderstandings and increased rates of divorce [03:00:50].

Madhavan values "raw conversations" that are unfiltered and believes they are therapeutic [03:17:15]. He acknowledges the challenges of public life, where comments can be taken out of context [03:33:40]. He advises to focus on the majority of positive feedback rather than the few negative comments, as the mind often fixates on stress to survive [01:08:05].

## Family Life and Relationships
Madhavan is married to Sarita, and they have a son, Vedant. He and Sarita are "not very pleased" with the memes comparing Vedant to other celebrity kids, feeling it hurts others and can lead to a false sense of worth [01:33:23]. They actively try to promote other young athletes who achieve success, emphasizing that Vedant is not the best swimmer in the country, though he has set a national record for his age group [01:41:07]. They teach Vedant about the pitfalls of adulation and the importance of humility, preparing him for potential judgment if he falters [01:48:47].

He observes that many divorces among his peers are due to partners changing significantly after years of marriage, often influenced by new societal expectations driven by social media [01:45:09]. He believes marriage should be a "union of two souls" based on respect and love, not a "business deal" [01:43:08]. He attributes the success of his own marriage to mutual respect and his continuous effort to make his wife feel appreciated [02:29:31]. He believes getting married younger allows for greater flexibility to change and compromise for a partner before "eccentricity set in" [02:30:17].

Madhavan stresses the importance of caring for aging parents, viewing it as an "intrinsic part of our growing up" in Indian culture [01:14:49]. He considers the "blessing of the elders" to be a strong force in his life [01:57:33]. He put in extra effort to overcommunicate and hug his parents, noting that his father, initially not prone to public displays of affection, eventually "warmed up to it" [01:18:13]. He believes hugging is a "very primal requirement" that is grounding and relaxing [01:18:51].

## Hobbies and Indulgences
Madhavan leads a highly indulgent life filled with diverse activities [01:43:04]. He is an RC pilot, building and flying planes and helicopters [01:43:09]. He enjoys golfing, biking with superbikes, and skiing [01:43:17]. He is also an engineering enthusiast and loves writing stories and exploring new vegetarian cuisines worldwide [01:43:20].

His most expensive purchase was a yacht, which he bought after getting his captain's license during COVID-19 [01:46:53]. He enjoys it thoroughly as a place to write and finds "maximum pleasure" when his friends and family treat it as their own [01:56:57]. He believes "all expensive purchases are for the boy inside and not the man" [01:51:30].

## Personal Philosophy
Madhavan emphasizes the importance of dealing with failure, calling it the "most important weapon" and one's "best friend all your life" [01:57:57]. He loves what failures teach him, enabling him to rise from challenges [01:58:28]. He maintains a "childlike enthusiasm and inquisitiveness" in his career and life, constantly seeking to learn new things and experience new opportunities [04:17:48]. He values authentic, unfiltered conversations and meeting people he wants to keep in touch with, learning something new, or enabling someone else to experience something new as indicators of a good day [01:43:10].

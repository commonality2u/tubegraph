The way history is taught in India often reflects a narrative that was shaped by external forces, leading to a distorted understanding of the past. This influence has led to a calculated bias in history books and a subsequent loss of cultural and historical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Historical Narrative Distortion
History books in India today were largely written perhaps 100 to 200 years ago, containing a "calculated bias" that spreads misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This means that a common perception is that significant Indian civilization only began after the arrival of the Mughals and Europeans, downplaying earlier achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. For instance, many people in India might know the first Mughal king, but not the first Chola king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

The hosts note that in the last 30 years, [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | history]] on a global scale has changed due to more archaeological discoveries, but the education system has not kept pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Impact on Cultural Heritage and Knowledge
[[indian_political_landscape | India's geopolitical influence]] has been shaped by centuries of invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This has led to the destruction of many ancient temples, particularly in North and Central India, leaving a greater concentration of intact ancient temples in South India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. While some from the South might mock the North for lacking ancient Hindu temples, it's acknowledged that the North's intense resistance against invaders inadvertently preserved the South's heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The distortion of history in India parallels experiences in other colonized nations. For example, in Australia, colonizers classified Indigenous people as "flora and fauna" and erased much of their culture, including temples, through acts like separating children from their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. In India, this was a "separation of our hearts from our culture through our history books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Post-independence, colonial powers also left behind deliberate divisions, such as the India-Pakistan partition and a flawed education system, to destabilize the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Challenging Mainstream Historical Accounts
Praveen Mohan dedicates his time to exploring ancient sites to "uncover the truths about the past that may have been forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His work directly challenges the traditional view that ancient Indians were merely "tribes with sticks and stones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### The "Evolution of Technique" Paradox
A key argument against the mainstream historical narrative is the absence of an "evolution of technique" in ancient Indian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. In typical human development, newer buildings are larger and better than older ones (e.g., Eiffel Tower to Burj Khalifa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. However, in India:
*   The largest and oldest cave temple structure is the [[Archaeological findings related to Indian epics | Ajanta Caves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   The largest and oldest ancient dam, Kallanai, is 2,000 years old and still exists, yet no larger dams were built for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   The Kailasa Temple, carved from a single mountain 1,300 years ago, remains unmatched in its scale and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

This lack of observable progression suggests that these advanced structures "don't follow a pattern" and seem to appear suddenly, as if "a giant woke up and they built insane structures and they're gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Advanced Ancient Technology
Archaeologists confirm that pillars in temples like Hoysaleswara and Chennakesava in Karnataka were made using "lathe machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. These machines are necessary to create perfectly circular shapes that cannot be made with primitive tools like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The sheer size of these pillars, weighing up to 20 tons, implies colossal lathe machines, perhaps 300-400 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

Furthermore, some temples feature intricate carvings, such as a 1-inch stone skull that is completely hollow with internal passages for a needle to pass through its eyes, ears, and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. This intricacy suggests advanced tooling beyond simple chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, which recently received UNESCO World Heritage status, is made of bricks that float in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This technology, similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), indicates an ancient understanding of earthquake-proof construction, used 800-900 years ago in an earthquake-prone area, which allowed the temple to survive massive earthquakes that destroyed surrounding structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

The absence of these advanced technologies in historical records and their lack of continuity suggests a deliberate omission or suppression of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

## Modern Challenges to Historical Narratives
The suppression of alternative historical theories continues in the modern age, impacting [[impact_of_international_narratives_and_algorithms_on_india | India's geopolitical influence]] and public understanding. Content creators like Praveen Mohan, who publish findings that challenge mainstream historical narratives, face demonetization and bans on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. YouTube has cited reasons like "nudity" for banning videos showing Hindu deities or Jain gods, despite similar nude carvings of Greek gods in museums being allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. This censorship is seen as a "racist angle" and a conscious effort to "modify the behavior of thousands of YouTubers" away from covering Hindu temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.

## Ancient Civilizations and Shared Narratives
Ancient temples served not just as places of worship but as "Wikipedia in stone" or "town museums" designed to transmit knowledge across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. They were carved in stone to ensure longevity against destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. Different levels of carvings catered to different age groups:
*   Children (0-5 years) saw animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
*   Older children (6-10 years) saw music and dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.
*   Adolescents (11-15 years) saw science and technology, like sundials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   Young adults (16-20 years) saw war, administration, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.
*   Adults (21-25 years) saw erotica and practices like women giving birth standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. This demonstrates an open and "carefree" ancient Indian society that normalized various aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>.

### The Mystery of the Nagas
The ubiquitous presence of [[Archaeological findings related to Indian epics | Nagas]] in ancient Indian temples and structures worldwide suggests they are the "oldest gods around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. They are found in all ancient temples, unlike other deities, implying their foundational importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

In Hindu texts, Nagas are not mere snakes but a distinct, shape-shifting humanoid species that lived underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. Ancient carvings in Mahabalipuram show Nagas transforming from snakes to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. This concept of reptilian-like beings is found in many ancient civilizations, often as "the very first queen or king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. For example, the first ruler of Cambodia is a Naga woman named Soma, who marries a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.

Further evidence of ancient advanced civilizations includes:
*   Carvings of dinosaurs (e.g., Stegosaurus at Ta Prohm Temple in Cambodia) in temples built long after their supposed extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   Carvings of extinct animals like a four-tusked elephant (ancestor of the mammoth) in Angkor Wat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

This evidence suggests that ancient peoples had knowledge of species that existed hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago, challenging the accepted timeline of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Local accounts from remote villages in India describe short beings who came from the sky, civilized humans by teaching them construction and other technologies, and then vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. These beings, often associated with the Nagas, were revered and had temples built for them at the foot of mountains where they supposedly resided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.

## Conclusion
The podcast advocates for critical thinking when examining history, urging listeners to question traditional narratives and be open to the wonders of the world and the possibility of more advanced past civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. It suggests that there are "serious holes in history and archaeology books" that need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>.

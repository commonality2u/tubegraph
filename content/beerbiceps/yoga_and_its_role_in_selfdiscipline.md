Sva Shashi, a prominent young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success to his practice of [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | celibacy]] and a disciplined yogic lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For nine years, he has followed a "no sex and no fap" rule, believing it has given him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This podcast explores how his adherence to yoga and self-discipline has impacted his personal and professional life, including his multi-million dollar wellness startup, Diva Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Journey into Yoga and Discipline
Sva's journey into yoga began at age six when his parents enrolled him in a class to help him balance and focus better for cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While he initially focused on the physical aspects of yoga, his deeper engagement started at 17 when he took over a class his father couldn't complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

After about 30-45 days of classes, Sva started practicing "sadas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
> "Sadas in Sanskrit means [[the_role_of_education_and_discipline_in_personal_development | discipline]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

He undertook various sadas, including:
*   Being silent for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   [[importance_of_meditation | Meditating]] for 9 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Practicing Vipassanā <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Mindful living, including not touching people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Sva noticed that every time he completed a sada, he advanced in different aspects of his life, professionally and in his cricket game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This consistent positive reinforcement encouraged him to take on further commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The Five Precepts of Self-Discipline
His teacher presented him with five precepts, which Sva committed to follow for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. These precepts form the core of his [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | self-discipline]]:

1.  **No Intoxication**: This included no alcohol, no smoking, and no non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Alcohol and smoking were easy to avoid as he had never indulged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Practicing non-violence through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. He genuinely cannot recall the last time he even killed a mosquito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **No Mental and Physical Stealing**: This meant no physical theft and no mental coveting of others' possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Aspiring for personal achievements like buying a car or a house is fine, but not mentally stealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Sva committed to not even telling white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. If he was late due to oversleeping, he stated that as the reason, not traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This commitment led to some temporary loss of friendships but ultimately built immense trust, with parents trusting him with their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
5.  **[[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | Celibacy]]**: This was the most challenging precept due to his age and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It meant no sex, no fap, no physical intimacy, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. For the first year and a half, he tried to prove his teacher wrong, but by 19 and a half, it became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Semen Retention and Yogic Practice
Sva emphasizes that the benefits of [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | semen retention]] are significant when combined with the other four disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
> "[[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | Semen retention]] means largely taking that energy to your brain, taking it upwards instead of having it being released" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

This upward channeling of energy opens up a dimension of creative thought process and right-brain activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Sva has experienced increased stamina, energy, and enhanced performance in both cricket and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. He describes the level of peak performance achieved through conscious semen retention as "unreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

A simple [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] exercise for managing sexual energy involves sitting, breathing deeply, and visualizing energy flowing from the sex organs upward through the spine into the brain, then spreading through the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This helps re-channel sexual energy into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

Sva also notes that [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | semen retention]] can make one more magnetic or attractive, possibly due to an energetic shift rather than physical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. His definition of attraction has changed, moving beyond superficial physical aspects to a deeper understanding of human connection, fostering compassion and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Intuition and [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | Spiritual Lifestyle]]
Sva's consistent adherence to his [[the_role_of_education_and_discipline_in_personal_development | disciplined]] and [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual lifestyle]] has significantly enhanced his intuition, or "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. He has experienced "unreal" instances of predicting outcomes, such as a friend receiving a visa on a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

However, he emphasizes that he has never consciously used his intuition for career or personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. His teacher taught him that [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spirituality]] ("Adhyatma") means "coming to oneself" and "being in the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Consciously seeking intuition for future benefit would break the practice of being present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

Sva believes that everyone is intuitive, but some realize it more because they've cleared the blocks caused by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. The "third eye," or Ajna chakra, is associated with intuition and can be opened through various practices like [[importance_of_meditation | meditation]] and pranayama (breath control) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. He attributes significant life events, such as Jennifer Lopez investing in his company, to this manifestation, rather than mere coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

### Meditation Practice
Sva's intensive [[importance_of_meditation | meditation]] practice today is the Anapana of Vipassanā, which involves focusing on the normal and natural flow of breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to observe thoughts without getting involved, allowing them to pass like "leaves in a river" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This practice increases focus levels in waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.

> "1 hour of yoga a day will sort you out for 23 hours of your day and you'll be so energetic you don't need x amount of hours of sleep between 4 to 6 hours of sleep is great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings from Yogic Discipline
Sva shares three key life learnings that stem from his [[importance_of_spiritual_discipline | spiritual discipline]] and experiences:

1.  **Be Authentic and True to Yourself**: It is crucial to remain true to oneself and not be swayed by external pressures from environment or peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The first step to achieving any goal is simply taking that first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Practice Self-Care**: Self-care, both physical and mental, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. One must love and take care of oneself first to be able to care for and do good for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. This includes a mix of physical activities like gym or functional training, and mindful practices like breathing exercises to stay present and improve daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person**: Especially in business and leadership, "people management" is the most important skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good employer and fostering strong team relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. This approach collectively leads to becoming a more compassionate person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

His personal transformation through these practices motivated him to found his yoga company, aiming to spread this message to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

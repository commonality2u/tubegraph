The [[ancient_indian_epics_mahabharata_and_ramayana | Mahabharata]] epic primarily centers around the Kuru Clan and the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas. However, [[Shri Krishna]], a historical figure who lived over 7,500 years ago, played a pivotal role in the events, connecting the narratives of the Yadava and Pandava clans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## The Yadava Clan
The Yadava clan is the lineage to which [[Shri Krishna]] belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The *Harivamsa*, an appendix to the [[ancient_indian_epics_mahabharata_and_ramayana | Mahabharata]], details the genealogy of [[Shri Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

### [[Shri Krishna]]'s Origins and Kingdom
*   [[Shri Krishna]] was born in prison in Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. His uncle Kamsa, the maternal uncle, sought to kill him due to a prophecy that he would be killed by his mother's eighth child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
*   He was made to escape after birth and was raised in Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
*   At the age of 11, [[Shri Krishna]] killed Kamsa and reinstated his father, Ugrasena, to the kingdom of Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   Later, [[Shri Krishna]] moved from Mathura (Central/North India) to the west coast of India, establishing a kingdom in Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. This was his ancestral property, the ancient city of Kusasthali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   The move to Dwarka was strategic due to constant conflict with Jarasandha, who controlled trade routes from Mathura via the Yamuna and Ganga rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. Jarasandha had defeated [[Shri Krishna]] and the Yadus 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. Dwarka offered uninterrupted trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>, leading to its extreme prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

### Dwarka's Destruction
*   [[Shri Krishna]]'s Dwarka was flooded and destroyed by rising sea waters in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:00">[01:5:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This event also marked [[Shri Krishna]]'s passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Archeological evidence dating back approximately 30,000 years has been found at the site of ancient Kusasthali, suggesting its long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   After [[Shri Krishna]]'s passing and Dwarka's destruction, many surviving Yadus and Yadava women were taken by Arjun to Hastinapura and Indraprastha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. A great-grandson of [[Shri Krishna]] was established in Indraprastha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   The destruction of the Yadava clan is sometimes attributed to Gandhari's curse, but it's also pragmatically understood as a consequence of their extreme prosperity leading to self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## The Pandava Clan
The Pandavas are the "good" clan of cousins in the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]], warring with the Kauravas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. They are related to [[Shri Krishna]] as his cousins through their mother, Kunti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Key Figures and Relationship with [[Shri Krishna]]
*   The Pandava brothers first met [[Shri Krishna]] when they were 33 years old, at Draupadi's swayamvar (self-choice marriage ceremony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   [[Shri Krishna]] was a key strategic character for the Pandava side in the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   The [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]] War took place in 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. At this time, [[Shri Krishna]] and Arjun were approximately 70-72 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Bhishma was over 140 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Arjun**: [[Shri Krishna]]'s close disciple, to whom the Bhagavad Gita was recited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. After [[Shri Krishna]]'s passing, Arjun lost his strength and was defeated by Abhir during his journey to relocate the Dwarka residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Bhima**: Often misperceived as merely muscular and unintelligent, Bhima was in fact a very intelligent individual, possessing a "six-pack" body (described as 'Roder Vuka' or fox/jackal-like tummy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He frequently anticipated [[Shri Krishna]]'s advice and was capable of immense feats, including killing Jarasandha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Draupadi herself expressed immense confidence in Bhima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
    *   Bhima had a son, Ghatotkacha, with Hidimba, a powerful 'Rakshasi' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. Ghatotkacha was a key warrior in the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]] war, forcing Karna to use a reserved weapon on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **Yudhishthir**: The eldest Pandava brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. Draupadi's frustration at times led her to wish Bhima was the elder brother instead of Yudhishthir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### Descendants of the Pandavas
The *Bhagavata Purana* and *Skanda Purana* discuss the descendants of the Pandavas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. The *Skanda Purana* mentions a gap of 3,310 years between Parikshit (a Pandava descendant) and Chanakya, placing Chanakya much earlier than commonly assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

## Interplay between Clans and Historical Evidence
The historical dating of the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]] to 5561 BCE and [[Shri Krishna]]'s life (5633 BCE - 5525 BCE) is supported by "crucial evidence" derived from astronomical observations described in texts like *Harivamsa* and *Bhagavata Purana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. These celestial alignments are so rare that they have not occurred in thousands of years before or since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Key Astronomical Evidence
*   A comet (Ketu) described as covering 13 Nakshatras (half the sky) and making the moon's path unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This specific event is dated to March 22, 5622 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, coinciding with [[Shri Krishna]] killing Kamsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Mercury visible on the western horizon after sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   Affliction of a Nakshatra by a malefic planet (Ghora Graha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   A total solar eclipse during daytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   Mars (Angaraka) in a 'Vakra' (oblique crossing) motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

This meticulous celestial and terrestrial evidence, combined with internal textual consistency, allows for a precise historical biography of [[Shri Krishna]] and, by extension, the events involving both the Yadava and Pandava clans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

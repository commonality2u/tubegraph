The Indian Paras SF (Special Forces) is regarded by many Indians as the most advanced part of the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Indian Army]], and on a global scale, it is considered one of the most respected regiments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | Major Vivek Jacob]], a veteran of the Indian Paras SF, describes the rigorous selection and training process that shapes these elite soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Entry into the Indian Army

The journey begins before the National Defence Academy (NDA), where individuals decide if they wish to join the Air Force, Army, or Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Upon successful entry through merit, cadets are classified into their chosen service branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

During the initial four terms at NDA, all cadets undergo similar training. In the fifth and sixth terms, training becomes specialized: Air Force cadets learn to fly gliders, Navy cadets focus on navigation, and Army cadets delve into weapon training and other Army-specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. After NDA, Army cadets proceed to the Indian Military Academy (IMA) for approximately a year before being commissioned into their respective services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Regiment Selection at IMA

At the completion of their year at IMA, cadets opt for a particular regiment within the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This selection is based on a merit list, which evaluates performance in service subjects, physical capabilities, sports, and leadership qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Super Block**: The top 10 to 20 cadets in merit who get to choose their desired regiment, provided there's a vacancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Par Block**: The lowest in merit, who also choose their preference but are assigned based on available vacancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The overall aim of this grading and spreading is to ensure an equal distribution of balanced personalities and talent across all regiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Volunteering for Special Forces

To join the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Special Forces]], one must volunteer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This act of volunteering itself is the first level of clearance, as it takes significant courage to sign the form, knowing the high stakes and potential disappointment if one doesn't make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. There is no guarantee of selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### The Probation Process

Upon arriving at a [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Special Forces Unit]], a probationary period begins, designed to "screw you, teach you, break you and teach you new things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This process aims to strip away ego and preconceived notions, bringing individuals entirely into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

The standard probation period is three months, though [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | Major Vivek Jacob]] experienced a six-month process due to various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

> "...the selection process of Special Forces is so intense that you know all your all your paraphenalia of your ego and and and your perceptions of yourself and all those things they dissolve in the amount of energy which is expended or you are exposed to it just shatters all that is around around you and very quickly you are brought out from there and then looked at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>

The training is a dual process of being "broken down, shattered, torn apart" while simultaneously being taught essential skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This is done with extreme efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

#### Training Components
*   **Explosive Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>
*   **Unarmed Combat Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   **Weapon Training**: Weapons become an extension of the body; for [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | Major Jacob]], his AK-47 was tied to him for six months, leading to an instinctive connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Losing one's weapon, even for a moment, leads to immediate dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Endurance Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   **Navigation Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>
*   **Emergency Medical First Response Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   **Survival Training** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>

#### Daily Life During Probation
Days typically start around 4:00 or 4:30 AM, or even earlier, with extended periods of no sleep, sometimes for couple of days at a stretch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. The day is filled with training and constant scrutiny until 7:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Officers and soldiers undergo probation together, living, eating, and training side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

After the day's physical and mental exhaustion, probationers are expected to prepare for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. For officers, an additional layer of probation begins at the officers' mess, where they must memorize intricate details about the unit's history, trophies, and the stories of fallen heroes. They are then subjected to rapid-fire questions testing their knowledge and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. Failure to answer results in punitive duties, such as patrolling the entire battalion every half hour through the night, followed by a physically demanding endurance test in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Despite lack of sleep, candidates are expected to perform at the highest level, often placing in the top ranks, as excuses are not tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

> [!TIP] The purpose of this intense environment is to identify individuals who can function and lead under extreme duress, prioritizing performance regardless of personal discomfort or exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | Special Forces Mindset]]

The training is designed to shatter "all your paraphernalia of your ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It pushes individuals to their physical, mental, and emotional limits to reveal their true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The goal is to determine if a person can be trusted to perform in combat, to "do what needs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The core characteristic sought is an "exploratory spirit" â€“ a willingness to constantly explore and push boundaries, even at the cost of one's own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This means being able to place one's life on the line, letting go of attachments to family and personal safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The training instills a profound realization: "nothing is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. This realization becomes the "chief weapon" of a [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Special Forces]] operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. While training is intense, nothing can truly match [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | combat]] itself, which further refines and tears up an individual, placing them at the right mindset for the duality of life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] In [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | combat]], the [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | Special Forces mindset]] prioritizes efficiency. They are like "surgical instruments" chosen for precise tasks in [[role_of_the_indian_army_in_national_and_international_contexts | national security]] contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to find individuals with the ability to make a choice for themselves and "stick by it" even in the face of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This unwavering resolve is crucial for survival and success in the chaotic environment of [[experiences_of_col_rajeev_bharwan_in_military_combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Leadership in [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Special Forces]] is not based on rank, but on an individual's ability to take responsibility and inspire trust in their team, especially when chaos reigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

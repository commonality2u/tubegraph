Priyanka Chopra Jonas's return to the podcast marks a significant moment, as her previous appearance was a turning point for the show, having been the 13th episode of TRS ever, now with over 250 English episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This conversation is described as a sequel to that initial discussion, delving into deeper and more motivational aspects of her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Challenging Traditional Norms and Work Ethic

Priyanka Chopra Jonas reflects on a past romanticization of intense, non-stop work, where success was equated with working 24 hours a day, doing multiple movies simultaneously, and sacrificing sleep and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, through more life experience, she has realized the crucial [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | importance of work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She emphasizes that work can be a source of joy and creativity rather than just hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This perspective allows her to pursue six different verticals in her career—including business, production, writing, and acting—while also fully disengaging to spend time with her family, watch movies, and rejuvenate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

She contests the idea of retiring early, stating that she loves her job and the privilege of being in a unique position that she built herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This legacy is not something she wants to give up, as it serves as an inspiration for future generations who may not have seen such potential for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The Fearless New Generation of Women

Priyanka Chopra Jonas expresses admiration for the current [[gender_and_societal_roles_in_modern_times | generation of girls]], describing them as fearless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. These young women are taking charge of their own lives and refusing to conform to the "cookie-cutter mold" that previous generations, like their mothers or grandmothers, might have had to fit into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. She notes that many young women she meets have "changed the trajectory of their families" through their personal choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Her own generation of women, including her female co-actors, actively fought for better representation and agency in films, demanding to be the face on posters and securing roles that women had not previously been offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This struggle, she believes, "opened the doors for the generation after us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Redefining Success and Breaking Barriers

Priyanka Chopra Jonas acknowledges that her success story is one of the biggest from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, but highlights the extensive hard work involved. She points out that in the US, she had to start from scratch, going from an established career in India to taking on small roles in Hollywood movies and humbly introducing herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. It took her 10 years, from 2010 to 2020, to secure her first leading role in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

A significant breakthrough came in 2020 when she finally received the same remuneration as her male co-actor in a movie, something she had never experienced in 21 years of working in Bollywood, even when her role was equally significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This highlights a persistent gender pay gap in the entertainment industry that she personally overcame.

## Advocating for Change in Language and Social Conditioning

Chopra Jonas challenges the use of gendered terms like "female lead films," "female athlete," "female politician," or "female actress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. She argues for changing this vocabulary, suggesting that just "athlete," "politician," or "actress" should suffice, as male counterparts are not referred to with a gender qualifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This directly relates to [[gender_and_societal_roles_in_modern_times | gender dynamics and equality]].

She recalls being taught in moral science classes at convent school that "women should be seen not heard," and about the lengths of skirts or how women should sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This instilled conditioning told women they had to be a "good girl" in a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Her message is that "Good Girls Don't Make History," emphasizing that "Bold Girls Make History" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

## Message for Young, Ambitious Women

For young, ambitious women, her advice is to disregard the "noise" and narratives that dictate how they should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. To be the "lead actor" of one's own life, one must make choices that may be contrary to what they've heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This empowerment, she says, may not come from parents, family, or partners, but must originate from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. If internal encouragement is lacking, she advises seeking inspiration from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Journey as Empowerment

Priyanka Chopra Jonas's journey into entrepreneurship, particularly with her brand Anomaly, is another facet of her empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:24">[01:26:24]</a>. Her mother, also an entrepreneur, advised her to consider production after turning 30, anticipating a short shelf life for actresses in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. This foresight led her to explore the business of entertainment and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:32">[02:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.

Her involvement with Bumble, bringing it to India, exemplified the power of a new idea to create safe spaces where women could take the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>. Anomaly, her first independently founded brand, aims to provide affordable, sustainable, and clean hair care products, challenging traditional gendered marketing in the beauty industry (e.g., "Men's Hair Care" vs. "Women's Hair Care") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. The success of Anomaly, selling one product every 7 seconds on its launch day on Nykaa and becoming a top 10 brand, demonstrates the impact of her vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

This venture underscores the changing landscape for careers, moving beyond traditional paths like doctor or engineer to embrace and monetize new ideas, encouraging a generation of [[parental_perspectives_on_pursuing_unconventional_careers | parents]] to support their children's entrepreneurial dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:47">[02:30:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles and Negative Narratives

Chopra Jonas candidly discusses the challenges of success, acknowledging that many people may try to jeopardize one's career out of jealousy or envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. She suggests that this negative mindset in India might stem from a colonial past, leading to a "divide and rule" mentality on an emotional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Instead of succumbing to this negativity, she advises focusing on those who believe in you and on any "sliver of light" or inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

She also reflects on the difficulty of being a public figure, constantly subject to public consumption and opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Despite potentially facing criticism or being deemed "unlikable," she asserts that her fame is a byproduct of her job, not her job itself, and it does not define her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Her grounded nature, maintained by her family, helps her navigate these pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## The Power of Choice and Purpose

Priyanka Chopra Jonas defines the meaning of life as having purpose between birth and death, emphasizing that success is subjective and individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. She advocates for creating one's own miracles by focusing on achievable "next steps" rather than waiting for impossible dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. She urges individuals to make choices that bring peace, as that is the ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

This commitment to [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance | personal growth and overcoming failure]] is evident in her journey, where she advises her younger self not to stress about aging or losing position, reminding that aging is a natural part of life to be embraced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. She stresses the importance of surrounding oneself with "champions" and cutting off toxic people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

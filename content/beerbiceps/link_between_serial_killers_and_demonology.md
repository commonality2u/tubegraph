Paranormal investigator Sarabjit Mohanty discusses the potential link between serial killers and [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonology]], suggesting that many horrific acts might be connected to non-human entities or a loss of human soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.

## Demonology Defined
[[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | Demonology]] is described as the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>. These are considered "inhuman spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:45">[03:43:45]</a> or entities that have never taken a physical birth or walked the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:48">[03:45:48]</a>. This distinguishes them from "human spirits," which are the souls of deceased people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:41">[03:40:41]</a>.

While Indian religious texts speak of figures like Pishach, Asur, and Rakasa, which are considered Indian demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, modern understanding of demonology often stems from Christian perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, all religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism, have their own concepts of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:42">[03:39:42]</a>. It's suggested that religions created these demonic figures to strengthen faith in God by instilling fear of a darker alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

### Distinguishing Demons from Spirits
The investigator notes that many alleged cases of [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]] are actually caused by ordinary human spirits that are "portraying itself to be a demon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>. Demons are considered far more powerful, capable of causing greater emotional and physical damage and more havoc than regular spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. The investigator has not personally encountered what he would classify as a true demon like Beelzebub or Asura, often finding even severe manifestations to be powerful spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>. These powerful spirits can operate factory machines and cause physical harm to workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:25">[03:42:25]</a>.

## Serial Killer Cases and Demonic Links
Mohanty suggests that individuals who commit acts like those of serial killers cannot be fully human, having lost their soul's humanity or emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:07">[02:46:07]</a>. He proposes that they either were [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | possessed by a demon]] or became demonic through their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

*   **Jeffrey Dahmer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:59">[02:56:59]</a>: Targeted the LGBTQ+ community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:09">[02:57:09]</a>. While there are some sayings about Dahmer's potential connection to the occult, they are not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:16">[03:14:16]</a>.
*   **Son of Sam (David Berkowitz)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>: Targeted females, primarily prostitutes, killing them brutally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>. He claimed to have been commanded by his neighbor's pet dog, which he believed was Lucifer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:45">[02:41:45]</a>. Mohanty questions how a sane human could commit such acts, asserting that Berkowitz either was [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | possessed by a demon]] or became one himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:17">[02:47:17]</a>.
*   **Burari Case** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>: Mentioned as having links to [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonology]].

### The Case of Michael Taylor (1974)
The story of Michael Taylor, from Central England, is presented as a complex case with potential links to [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Taylor was a seemingly normal man who began experiencing issues and was encouraged to go to church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. During a prayer, he reacted aggressively, attacking a girl named Sophie, leading to a declaration by the congregation that he was possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

An [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | exorcism]] was performed, involving crucifixes in his mouth, being tied to a bed, and holy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The priests, exhausted, sent him home to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>. The next day, Taylor was found on the street, covered in blood, shouting "Blood of Satan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He had brutally murdered his wife, Christian Taylor, by ripping her face apart with his bare hands, removing her eyes and tongue, and tearing apart their dog limb by limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

Mohanty offers several angles for interpretation of the Michael Taylor case:
1.  **Schizophrenia:** Taylor could have been schizophrenic, and the "exorcism" exacerbated his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Lack of open discussion about mental illness in 1974 might have prevented proper diagnosis and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Serial Killer Tendencies:** Taylor's inability to maintain a job and unstable life could be seen as red flags for a developing criminal or serial killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Actual Possession:** The third possibility is that he was genuinely [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | possessed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

This case highlights the difficulty in discerning [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]] from psychological illness.

### Importance of Medical Assessment
In cases of suspected [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]], the paranormal investigation team first asks for medical reports to rule out psychological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Many supposed possession cases are found to be psychological effects or situations triggered by distress, like a 15-year-old girl faking possession to avoid exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

This phenomenon, where individuals exhibit extraordinary strength or aggression due to intense psychological focus or adrenaline, is called "excited delirium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This is seen in phenomena such as a mother gaining superhuman strength to protect her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, or even the exaggerated strength seen in movies where a "possessed" person lifts heavy objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. It's the body tapping into its latent capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## Rituals and Satanism
Some serial killers have openly admitted to connections with human sacrifices, occult practices, and Satanism to carry out their crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:01">[02:28:01]</a>. Satanic rituals, often performed for material gains or simply for "fun," continue to happen, leading to places being [[scientific_investigation_of_haunted_locations | haunted]] by demonic entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:59">[03:02:59]</a>. The film *Hereditary* is mentioned as incorporating actual satanic mantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

Paranormal investigators advise against using real symbols or practices from the occult in media without proper precautions, such as shielding the set with positive elements, due to the potential for genuine negative energetic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Skepticism vs. Belief
The field of paranormal investigation faces challenges from the scientific community because [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | paranormal]] phenomena cannot be easily replicated in a lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Furthermore, many fake practitioners have discredited the field, making it difficult for genuine investigators to gain scientific acknowledgement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

Mohanty asserts that "no proof is required for a believer, no proof is enough for a non-believer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, emphasizing the role of openness in understanding these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Many common beliefs, like ghosts wearing white saris, stem from ancient misconceptions about the purity of the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the human mind and body are capable of remarkable things, and many seemingly [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | paranormal]] events might be explained by understanding these inherent capabilities, though this requires patience and an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

Aashna Shroff attributes her entire family situation to shaping her into the person she is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Her upbringing was significantly influenced by her mother's role and the financial challenges they faced.

## Early Life and Family Structure

Shroff was raised by a single parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Her mother divorced around the time of Shroff's birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. She grew up living with her maternal grandparents and her mother's *masi* (aunt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Additionally, her mother's older sister, who has Down syndrome, also lived with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Financial Struggles

From a young age, Shroff's family faced significant financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Her mother was the sole earner, supporting four other family members in addition to Shroff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Her mother never explicitly told her, but there was a point during Shroff's college years when the family had only 1,500 rupees in their account, with no clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Her mother was instrumental in navigating them through this challenging phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Impact of Mother's Example and Responsibility

Shroff's mother's independence and constant effort to earn for the family had a profound effect on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Growing up, with her mother often out working, Shroff spent a lot of time with her grandparents and developed an early understanding of their struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. She feels that responsibility has been a core aspect of their family life since her childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Fueling Motivation and Goals

Shroff's primary motivation in her career is the happiness of her mother and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. She dedicates her earnings to her mother, wanting her to manage the household and enjoy life, as her mother never had the opportunity to do so in her younger years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. She wants her mother to be able to buy luxury bags and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, goals that directly reflect her mother's past sacrifices. This strong familial drive is a key factor in her [[challenges_and_motivations_in_aashna_shroffs_career | challenges and motivations]].

## Personal Qualities and Family Support

Shroff considers herself stubborn, a trait she believes has significantly contributed to her success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This stubbornness was evident when her mother, during a period of low income from the blog, advised her to shut it down and focus on her online store. Shroff refused, insisting on making time for both, a decision she is now grateful for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

In her professional life, Shroff relies on her *masi* (mother's cousin) to handle financial negotiations for her blogging business, recognizing her own weakness in that area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This reliance on a trusted family member highlights the ongoing influence of her family as a support system.

Priyanka Chopra is recognized for her ambition and magnetic personality, which have propelled her career. Host Ranveer Allahbadia sought to understand what drives her mentality and future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the host noted a widespread affection for Chopra across demographics, she humbly stated, "I don't think that's true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Driving Force: Confidence and Purpose

Chopra attributes her magnetism to confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, which she learned to cultivate herself and from the strong individuals in her family, especially her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Her personal [[impact_of_upbringing_and_family_on_priyanka_chopras_life | upbringing]] instilled in her that "it doesn't matter what your circumstances are it matters how large your dreams are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Her ambition is a core part of her identity, providing her with purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. She views her purpose as "the pursuit of excellence in anything that I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, stating she dislikes doing "anything less than perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Evolution and Learning in Her Career

Priyanka Chopra's journey into Bollywood began at 17, after winning Miss India and Miss World, leading to movie offers at 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Initially, she held a "trivial" view of acting, seeing it as simply wearing nice clothes, getting hair and makeup done, and performing lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. No one in her family had been in entertainment, though her father was a musician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred during the shooting of *Andaz*, where, after 40 takes of a song, choreographer Raju Khan criticized her, suggesting she learn to dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This led her to intensely study Kathak for six hours daily, realizing that "if you learn even if you don't know something if you have an ambition to be somewhere if you prepare yourself you have the ability to be better than everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. She emphasizes being prepared for everything, from interviews to red carpets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Transition to Producing
Her desire to learn extends to her current role as a producer. She chose to produce *The Sky Is Pink* with Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur because she admired them and had worked with them on six previous films, including *Fashion*, which helped define her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She acknowledged being "new as a producer" and wanted to learn from experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The film holds deep personal significance for her as it's based on a real-life couple with extraordinary circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Success

Chopra consciously moves on to the next project even after successes, believing that "you are defined by what you do next not what you left behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Her mindset after a hit film is "Great that happened what's next? How am I going to top that or what am I going to do that's going to be different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. She avoids repeating herself and stresses the importance of taking risks for evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. "Playing it safe... you'll never be someone who's a trailblazer who's a legend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Parental Influence and Discipline

Chopra's parents, both Army physicians, instilled discipline in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. She defines discipline not merely as punctuality but as being prepared, training, and committing 120% to any task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This disciplined approach stems from her parents' military background, where "even one mistake can cause a big big butterfly effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Her father taught her to "smile through everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> and was her "biggest champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He emphasized "the hustle," teaching her not to fear failure, as "what you do next after failure is what'll define you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Instead of dwelling on mistakes, she learned to find the courage to do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges

Chopra openly discusses her experiences with mental health issues, particularly after her father's passing, when she was starting over in a new country at age 31-32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Though she tried therapy, lack of consistency led her to find her own methods for coping, realizing that running from issues by overworking was not the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of allowing oneself to feel and accept emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Her full approach to this can be found at [[priyanka_chopras_approach_to_mental_health | Priyanka Chopra's Approach to Mental Health]].

Regarding external perception, Chopra chooses to keep some aspects of her life private, preferring to appear calm like a duck on the surface, while "paddling furiously under the water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. She believes in "Grace Under Fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> and finding her own solutions rather than being a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Legacy and Message

Priyanka Chopra desires to be remembered for leaving behind a legacy, wanting her children to be proud and to have "made a dent in my art in entertainment in my profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. She aims to be a "Trailblazer" and a "legend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Her message to young people is to avoid taking on excessive pressure and to be "like water," adaptable and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. She stresses that ambition is crucial for everyone, encouraging them to "have the guts to find your glory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> and challenge themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. She thrives under pressure and chaos, finding it fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

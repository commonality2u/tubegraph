Paranormal investigator Sarabjit Mohanty discusses the nature of spirits, ghosts, and [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic entities]], distinguishing between popular misconceptions and genuine [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He highlights the impact of media on public perception and the scientific and psychological aspects of purported [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | encounters with entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

## Distinguishing Spirits from Demonic Entities

Mohanty explains that while many believe they encounter [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | demonic entities]], a significant portion of these cases are actually human spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:51">[03:19:51]</a>.

### Spirits (Human)
Human spirits are defined as the souls of deceased individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:41">[03:30:41]</a>. They can be categorized into three types:
*   **Unaware Spirits** Many spirits are unaware they are dead and continue their daily routines in a loop, attempting to do things that physically manifest as objects falling or sounds heard by the living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. They often seek attention because they are confused about their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. An example is a soldier stuck in the 1800s at a graveyard in Kandala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, or a scholar from the 11th century stuck at Hulker Bridge in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Attention-Seeking Spirits** These spirits know they are dead but need attention, perhaps because they feel stuck or want help to cross over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Spirits** These spirits know they are dead and can cross over, but choose to remain for various reasons, such as seeking revenge or helping family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

**Life as a Spirit:**
Life as a spirit, especially for those stuck, can be described as "hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. If a spirit is attached to a living person, it cannot be acknowledged or seen, which is a painful experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Spirits may also be confined to specific areas, like a house, feeling disoriented if they try to cross an invisible boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Many spirits fear "Judgment Day" and the potential for punishment, leading them to avoid crossing over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This is why prisons are often reported as haunted, as criminals fear a harsher afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Demonic Entities (Inhuman)
[[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | Demonology]] is the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Demons are considered "inhuman spirits" because they have never taken a physical birth or walked the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. They are generally much more powerful than human spirits and can cause greater emotional and physical damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

In India, different forms of demons are recognized in various religions, such as Pishach, Asura, and Rakasa in Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. While the concept of demons is prevalent in religious texts, Mohanty's personal study suggests that religions created these figures to reinforce faith in divine powers by instilling fear of a darker alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

**Distinguishing Cases:**
Many cases reported as [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]] are actually human spirits mimicking demonic behavior, or are psychological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. True [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic possession]] cases, involving entities like Beelzebub or Asura, are rare in Mohanty's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Methods of Communication and Investigation
Paranormal investigators use specialized devices to communicate with entities, which they refer to as "intelligent energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

*   **PSB7 Device:** This device scans radio frequencies, and investigators can control the speed and direction of the scan to filter out random broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. By reversing the scan, they can ensure that any coherent words or names are not from radio stations, as normal speech would become undecipherable when reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **White Noise:** Spirits communicate through white noise, which contains all sound frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The concept is that if all spectrums are tapped into, communication with a spirit can be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **ESTES Experiment:** This involves a psychic wearing noise-cancelling headphones playing white noise and being blindfolded to block sensory input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This triggers other senses, allowing them to perceive messages from the spiritual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Pop Culture
Horror movies often create misconceptions about the [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **White Sari Ghost:** The idea of a female ghost in a white sari became popular in Indian horror films, leading to widespread belief that spirits always appear this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This misconception stems from an ancient belief that white represents a pure soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Liberty in Films:** Movies like *The Conjuring* are closer to reality in their portrayal of investigators, but still take creative liberties to generate fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Serial Killers and Demonology:** Some serial killers, like Son of Sam, claimed to be influenced by demonic entities or Satanic [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | rituals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Mohanty believes that individuals who commit such atrocities lose their humanity and become akin to demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## The Role of Psychology and Mental Health
It is crucial to distinguish between [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | paranormal occurrences]] and psychological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Assessment:** Before investigating a case of alleged possession, Mohanty's team requires medical reports, including psychiatric evaluations, MRIs, and brain studies, as many cases are found to be psychological in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Schizophrenia and Excited Delirium:** Conditions like schizophrenia can be mistaken for possession, especially if symptoms are reinforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. "Excited delirium" is a psychological term for when individuals exhibit extreme strength due to intense focus or psychological states, not necessarily possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This can explain phenomena like a person throwing parents or lifting heavy objects, as seen in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Mind's Influence:** What one consumes mentally can influence dreams, reality, and the subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Haunted Places and Energy Fields
The traditional meaning of "haunted" is simply a place that is frequently visited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Every place can be considered haunted by energies or human beings, who radiate their own energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **EMF in Sacred Spaces:** Temples, churches, and mosques have distinct EMF (Electromagnetic Field) readings because they are places of collective prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The human body generates electricity, and when many people pray, the collective energy can get "stuck" in the space, leading to a sense of satisfaction or vibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Abandoned Sacred Places:** Even abandoned temples and churches retain their EMFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Spirit Manifestation:** Spirits feed on EMF and human energy, using these to manifest and affect physical objects or electrical appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## Protection and Spiritual Practices
Various methods can be used for protection from negative entities and for spiritual growth.
*   **Meditation:** Meditation is highlighted as a powerful tool for self-protection, guarding the mind and soul, and personal evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It allows individuals to tap into their inner strength and realize the reality of both positive and negative energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Symbols and Objects:** Different religions and cultures use specific symbols and objects for protection against [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic entities]] and evil spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Examples include Om, Swastika, Yantra (Hinduism), Pentacle, Eye of Hamsa (Witchcraft), Thor's Hammer, and the Celtic Knot (Viking symbols) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Tattoos of such symbols are believed to integrate foreign elements into one's DNA and can be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Crystals:** Crystals are believed to be powerful tools for healing, protection, and shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. They absorb negative energy and need to be charged using natural energies like moonlight or sunlight, or through healing practices like Reiki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Crystals have their own intelligence and can be affected by human energy or *Chi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Channeling Divine Energies:** Some individuals, like *Mata Aana* phenomena, can channel positive deities to answer questions or deliver messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. However, this phenomenon can sometimes be faked, particularly in rural areas where women might seek attention and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Notable Case Studies

*   **Hulker Bridge, Pune:** Site of an investigation where a spirit from the 11th century, a scholar named Mr. Shas, was encountered. He was reportedly mummified alive in a box and thrown into a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Investigators communicated with him using the PSB7 device, hearing words like "cupboard" and "tape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. After informing him it was 2021 and praying for him, the spirit ceased communicating, suggesting he may have found peace and crossed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Taylor Case (1974):** A man, Michael Taylor, who was struggling with life, was taken to church and later exhibited aggressive behavior towards a girl. He was declared possessed and subjected to an [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | exorcism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The priests, exhausted, sent him home where he brutally murdered his wife and dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This case highlights various possibilities: schizophrenia, a pre-existing criminal nature, or actual possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Abandoned Church, Nanital:** An investigation revealed that both human spirits and potential [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | demonic entities]] were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. During an ESTES experiment, a psychic heard sounds and knew about the investigators' actions without being told, indicating genuine communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Physical phenomena, like a loud thud, also occurred in response to direct challenges to the spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

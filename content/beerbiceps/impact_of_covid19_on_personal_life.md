The COVID-19 pandemic brought about significant changes and revelations in personal lives, highlighting areas of insensitivity and forcing individuals to re-evaluate priorities. One individual shared her experience recovering from Corona, noting that while on heavy medication, people insensitively commented on her weight gain, asking "what is wrong with people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> and expressing surprise at the lack of empathy for someone recovering from an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The pandemic also served as a critical turning point for deeper reflection:
*   **Need for Deep Conversations** Post-COVID, it became evident that having profound conversations is more essential than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Reality Check and Pace of Life** The lockdown, in particular, offered a "big reality check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> on what truly matters in life. It highlighted the previously "crazy pace" of trying to accomplish ten things in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This shift enabled a more peaceful approach, allowing for focus on one task at a time, such as an interview, rather than juggling multiple commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Present** The experience made her realize the importance of a good day at work for a restful sleep, leading to a focus on the present moment and valuing each day, rather than planning for the distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Personal COVID-19 Experience
The individual described her own battle with COVID-19 as "a train that I did not see coming my way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Onset of Illness** She was shooting the night before developing a strong, high fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Having witnessed her parents go through it, she immediately sensed she was in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The next morning, her temperature remained high, and her oxygen levels were low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Hospitalization and Recovery** Her producer, Prep, swiftly got her to Continental Hospitals in Hyderabad within ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, where she received "top-notch treatment" for five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a> before being discharged and quarantined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Symptoms and Self-Deception** This was her first hospitalization, making the experience particularly frightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Despite experiencing immense body aches and difficulty breathing for several days prior to diagnosis, she attributed her symptoms to being fatigued from intense workouts and a hectic work schedule post-lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. She noted that her fitness level at her age initially masked the severity of her condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Realization of Solitude** The hospital journey brought a stark realization of being "alone in life" during major crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, despite her parents flying to Hyderabad to be near her (though they couldn't meet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. She acknowledged her parents' immense, constant support as pivotal to her achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
*   **Confronting Mortality** She admitted to thinking about death, as severe symptoms and cases of recovery turning fatal were not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from COVID-19
The near-death experience profoundly changed her perspective, leading to several key takeaways:
*   **Prioritizing What Matters** Give time and effort to what truly matters in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Authenticity** She can no longer "fake it" and will directly express her feelings, whether enjoyment or dislike, in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
*   **Gratitude** She developed a conscious and proactive effort to express gratitude to people who are pivotal in her life, understanding that she cannot achieve most things without their help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. This gratitude is not just for others but also for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. She now prays for simple, everyday things like good coffee, feeling that the universe has already gifted her with big things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Societal Shifts Post-Pandemic
The conversation also touched on broader societal impacts:
*   **Insensitivity and Scrutiny** The experience highlighted a broader societal insensitivity, where people can be harsh and judgmental, especially towards public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Actors, for instance, are constantly scrutinized, with expectations to look presentable even when ill or going through trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. She shared an anecdote of being told she looked "a little fat" after recovering from Corona, a comment she found incredibly insensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   **Ayurveda and Mental Health** The individual became a strong advocate for Ayurveda, recognizing it as "ancient wisdom" and incorporating practices like chewing food slowly and oil pulling into her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. She believes the current generation, often dubbed the "[[the_impact_of_social_media_and_changing_societal_norms | mental health issues generation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>, desperately needs the balance that Ayurveda can provide due to toxic lifestyles, partly driven by social media's emphasis on external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. Her personal shift to vegetarianism also reduced aggression and brought a sense of calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | Spirituality]] and [[Role of spirituality in personal and professional life | Peace]]** The pursuit of peace has become a central theme, recognizing that external factors like yoga cannot solely bring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. True peace is an "inside job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> that must be taken into one's own hands, not blamed on exterior forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. She identifies a void in her life as the search for peace amidst circumstances she has little control over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The pursuit of career goals, richness, or fame does not guarantee peace, but rather adds to the "craziness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Living in the Moment** The lockdown fostered a greater appreciation for the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>, emphasizing conscious engagement in daily activities rather than being preoccupied with multiple tasks or future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Self-Acceptance and Kindness** A key learning from her yoga practice is "ahimsa" (non-harm) towards oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>, recognizing that being harsh on oneself projects outwardly to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. The goal is to learn to love oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a> and avoid physical and emotional exhaustion caused by overworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Impulsivity and Experience** While disciplined, she is also impulsive, attributing this to being a Sagittarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. Her best and worst decisions have been impulsive, yet she would still choose that route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. The pandemic reinforced that while reading and watching self-help materials can be beneficial, true understanding comes from "experience" and "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>, ultimately realizing that one's own self is the solution to personal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

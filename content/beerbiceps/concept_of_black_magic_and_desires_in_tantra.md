## Understanding Black Magic (Abhichara Karma)

The concept commonly referred to as "black magic" is known in Sanskrit as *Abhichara Karma* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. *Abhichara Karma* is defined as anything that produces a negative result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. The origin of *Abhichara Karma* lies in one's own intention; the moment a negative thought is born, such as wanting an office colleague to leave for one's own peace, one's "black magic has started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>.

[[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]]'s role in this context is to provide a methodology of worship that increases the chance of success for any intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. If the intention is good, a good result will be achieved; if it is bad, the bad intention is the individual's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. This likens [[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]] to a sword, which can be used to cut vegetables for sustenance or to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.

It is emphasized that [[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]] itself is not inherently "dark" or "white"; rather, it is about effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. The vast majority of [[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]] (99%) does not cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Traditional practitioners of [[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]] do not view it as "small-time black magic" or *Jadu Tona* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>. Instead, it is a ritualistically complex method of *Devata Upasana* (worship of deities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

### Protection from Black Magic

One can indeed be harmed by *Abhichara Karma* if the person performing it possesses more *Shakti* (power or force) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. While *Bhakti* (faith) can lead to *Shakti*, it doesn't guarantee protection from physical or emotional harm, or even spiritual mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

Certain deities are invoked for protection against *Abhichara Karma*. For instance, Hera Ganapati, who rides a lion, is described as extremely potent for removing any form of black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>.

## Role of Desires in Spiritual Growth

[[role_of_desires_in_spiritual_growth | The role of desires in spiritual growth]] is nuanced. It's not about completely shunning material life to become spiritual, as some spiritual paths may require, but rather about developing a kind of detachment even within the material sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. One should enjoy what nature provides—platform, money, etc.—but without becoming overly attached to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

The ultimate aim of spiritual practice is to achieve such a high level of focus on the deity that one maintains detachment regardless of circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. This means viewing both positive and negative experiences as stemming from the Divine, trusting that the deity will lead one to where they need to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. Maintaining a certain degree of detachment from material growth is crucial, as practices like meditation help to gain this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

### The Deity's Test of Devotion

When a spiritual promise (*Sankalpa*) is made to a deity, they will test the devotee's commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. These tests can manifest as physical illness, unexpected external distractions, or other challenges that try to pull one away from their spiritual practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. The deity allows these obstacles to appear to gauge the strength of the devotee's willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

In the *Bhagavad Gita*, Lord Krishna exemplifies this by "purifying" Arjuna of his non-spiritual elements and attachments by challenging his desire not to fight, essentially performing a "Kurukshetra" on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This process, though painful, leads to a "cleansed" state, where the devotee has nothing left but to become spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

[[importance_of_focus_for_success | Focus]] is a deciding factor in success, whether in school, college, or career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Successful individuals are not necessarily those who work the hardest, but those who can maintain maximum focus in the minimum minutes of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. To achieve good marks or financial success, the key is how focused one can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

[[importance_of_focus_for_success | Focus]] is defined as staying in one place, switching off from all distractions, and remaining glued to a single spot, thought, or work task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Enemies of Focus

While attempting to stay focused, various "enemies of focus" can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These include personal struggles and emotional burdens:
*   Breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Bad marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   General pain in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Performance pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

These pains and worries are considered the biggest enemies to being focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, as they keep an individual "ungrounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The more grounded you are, the greater your ability to stay in one place and maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges by Improving Grounding

To become more focused, the first step is to work on your grounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### 1. Follow a Fitness Routine
Your body is built to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If you don't engage it sufficiently, you'll be left with an excess amount of energy, which can make you ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Tiring your body slightly helps balance hormones and energies within you, keeping your mind sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Incorporating [[role_of_fitness_in_improving_focus | fitness]] is crucial for improving grounding.

### 2. Choose the Correct Food
Your body is a collection of everything you consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Human eating habits have changed significantly in the last 100 to 200 years from clean, fresh food to packaged and processed items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A diet high in additives and processed sugar can make you feel more ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Therefore, choosing wisely and eating fresh food can lead to a significant positive change in your state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### 3. Work Your Mind Muscle
Just like biceps can be trained, your mind can also be trained to be focused, grounded, and stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The easiest way to ground your mind is through breath-based [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### Meditation Practice
*   Sit comfortably with your back erect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Focus solely on your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   It is normal for your mind to wander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>; simply bring your attention back to your breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   This act of bringing your mind back to one thought (your breath) is how your focus muscle is worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Your career demands focus on work tasks, and [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] trains your mind to focus on your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. To improve focus and maximize human potential, dedicate 20 minutes to train your brain muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Once your eyes open, use that stronger mental muscle to accomplish your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

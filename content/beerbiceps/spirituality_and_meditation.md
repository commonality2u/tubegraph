The speaker's journey into [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]] and [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditation]] began as a means to understand the deeper layers of existence beyond visible human presence, and to confront a lifelong fear of the dark and unseen entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Early Experiences with the Unseen

From a young age, the speaker questioned if there was a deeper layer of reality beyond what is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Growing up in a house with a hospital on the ground floor, the speaker always felt a presence, particularly in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This led to a prolonged fear of the dark, where the speaker couldn't sleep alone until the age of 19 or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Sleep Paralysis and the Entity

At age 11, the speaker frequently experienced sleep paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This scientific phenomenon occurs when one partially wakes up during sleep, but the brain's signals to paralyze the muscular system for protection remain active, leaving the body unable to move or scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In severe cases, nightmares can merge with reality, making the experience even more terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

During one particularly harrowing sleep paralysis episode, the speaker felt "shadowy creatures" chaining them to the bed, followed by the appearance of a pale-skinned, disheveled woman with one red eye, sitting on their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Spiritual Protection

Raised in a [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | spiritual]] family, the speaker's mother taught a specific mantra to ward off bad spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In the midst of the terrifying experience, the speaker closed their eyes and began chanting "Om Nam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This act of [[protection_through_meditation_and_spirituality | spiritual protection]] helped the speaker to eventually fall asleep and, upon waking, the entity was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Embracing Spirituality and Meditation

The speaker eventually overcame this deep-seated phobia by discovering [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | Spirituality]], as understood by the speaker, encompasses [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditation]], good karma, and the understanding of the spirit world, astral world, dark energies, and how to counter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Inspired by the "Autobiography of a Yogi," which states, "when you stare fear in the eye it ceases to exist," the speaker confronted their fear by strengthening their [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual muscle of the mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Regular Meditation Practice

Around the age of 22 or 23, the speaker began [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditating]] regularly, often with co-founder Rajas to foster a positive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Deep [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditations]] are typically performed in darkness and usually evoke positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Shared Spiritual Experience

During one late-night [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditation]] session, the speaker and Rajas experienced an overwhelmingly dark energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Recalling the "Autobiography of a Yogi" quote and the "Om Nam" mantra from childhood, the speaker continued [[meditation_and_mental_health | meditating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Both individuals felt they collectively pushed out a negative energy from the room and the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Psychic Confirmation and History

This shared experience was later corroborated by a psychic friend who, upon visiting the speaker's building, immediately identified a room with "a lot of dark energy" and a history of a "demon or a ghost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This room was directly beneath the speaker's childhood bedroom where the sleep paralysis incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The speaker's grandfather, who had run a hospital in the building since the 1960s, confirmed that patients in that specific area had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chests or even being pushed off their beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This imagery of a "scary looking woman" aligned with the speaker's own experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Continuous Spiritual Practice

Since the psychic's visit, the defunct hospital space has undergone pujas, havans, and candle lighting to make the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The speaker's deep embrace of [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]] stems from these personal encounters with darkness, which they learned to face and push out through the positivity of [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The speaker believes [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | spiritual practices]] are essential for combating the occult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

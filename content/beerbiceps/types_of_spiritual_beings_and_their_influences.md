The spiritual realm is populated by a variety of beings, both higher and lower, which can interact with the earthly plane and influence human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These interactions are often explored in ancient Hindu texts and tantric practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Lower Beings and Entities

These are typically described as discarnate entities who lack a physical body and may be trapped on the earthly plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, unable to progress further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Their knowledge is often as limited as human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:03">[03:09:03]</a>.

### Bhutas
Bhutas are discarnate entities that may roam the physical plane. They often retain human-like tendencies such as hunger, anger, and lust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. If agitated, they can cause trouble to those in their vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Influence**: They can project their anger or suffering onto anyone in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.
*   **Reality**: A person who dies violently or is not ready to accept death may initially not realize they are a ghost and try to interact with living beings, causing disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

### Pitrus (Ancestors)
Pitrus are a specific type of Bhutas, representing ancestors who have died but are stuck in a particular astral realm known as Pitru Loka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This happens if they are unable to take rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Influence**: They often manifest their problems and anger onto their living descendants due to strong genetic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. This can lead to diseases, obstructions in endeavors, and even accidents for family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
*   **Remedies**: Specific rituals are performed in certain sacred places (e.g., Trimbakeshwar in Nashik, Gaya, Kashi, Badrinath) to calm these spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Offering Pindadan (rice balls) and specific mantras are part of these rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

### Pret
Prets are described as very angry spirits, often individuals who died violent or non-conventional deaths (such as accidents at a young age or suicide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, or even criminals or tantrics who indulged in negative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
*   **Influence**: They can cause diseases, obstructions, and accidents for family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Their presence can be indicated by weird or strange negative occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Astrological charts may also indicate problems from a Pret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Pishach
Pishachas are considered more dangerous than Prets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Many never incarnated as humans, while some were highly advanced human beings (Brahma Pishacha) who misused spiritual knowledge, became greedy, or withheld knowledge from deserving individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.
*   **Influence**: They are extremely dangerous, akin to "mad bulls," attacking relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. They can cause physical harm, diseases, accidents, and scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. They are confined to specific areas with extreme negative energy, dark or filthy settings, often associated with a recurring foul odor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.
*   **Countering**: The vibration of higher deity mantras (e.g., Shiva, Vishnu, Durga) is distasteful to them, causing them to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

### Rakshasas and Asuras
Rakshasas and Asuras are considered the highest and most powerful negative entities in Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Nature**: They are described as beings with exceptional intelligence, masters of logic and intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. They are not atheists; they fully believe in the existence of gods but choose to act against the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. They are powerful practitioners who misuse their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   **Influence**: In the current era, they are unlikely to incarnate physically due to the lower spiritual caliber of humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. However, they can exert significant influence over people's minds and actions, particularly those through whom large-scale destruction can be caused (e.g., Hitler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. Their influence can manifest in negative practices, especially involving wealth, which can be seen as an "asuric influence" extracting a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Stories like that of Mahishasura in the Devi Mahatmyam describe battles lasting centuries, indicating their immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. These battles are viewed as creating a powerful energy stamp that continues to spiritually benefit those who remember them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.
*   **Liberation**: Anyone who dies at the hands of the great Gods is believed to achieve liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>.

## Higher Beings and Deities

These are powerful, benevolent entities who reside in higher realms and can offer guidance, protection, and transformation.

### Devas (Gods) and Goddesses
Deities are powerful beings who can transform and guide practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a>. Their full energy is too immense for an unprepared human mind and body to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>.
*   **Interaction**: As practitioners deepen their spiritual path, they may interact with these beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. A deity interacting with a devotee will attempt to transform them into a more spiritual state, guiding them to higher zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a>. However, merely "seeing" a deity does not guarantee transformation; genuine change in a person's life is the true indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>.
*   **Types**:
    *   **Hanuman**: An immortal deity who has not given up his body, making him very responsive to pleas on the Earth plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. He is an excellent protector deity, and his domain includes strength, power, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. The Hanuman Chalisa is believed to have anti-ghost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. Consistent chanting of the Hanuman Chalisa with faith and discipline, followed by meditation on Lord Rama's name, can lead to transformative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
    *   **Bhairava**: A fierce form of Shiva, also a powerful protector deity who responds quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.
    *   **Matangi**: A Mahavidya (great wisdom goddess) worshipped by the speaker in a personal experience for protection against negative entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   **Lord Shiva**: Controls time (Mahakal Shiva) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. He is deeply meditative (in samadhi), and calling him may take many lifetimes for a direct response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
    *   **Lord Vishnu**: Controls space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43">[01:25:43]</a>. His higher realms are described as progressively greater, from which he projects divine incarnations when balance is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>.
    *   **Mahalakshmi**: Goddess of wealth and prosperity, providing a sense of well-being and inner happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Ganas**: These are "family" or attendants of a deity, such as Shiva Ganas or Bhairava Ganas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:50">[02:37:50]</a>. They may appear before the main deity to check a practitioner's energy and readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>.

### Yakshas and Gandharvas
These are beings from higher realms who can take birth in human form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>.
*   **Influence**: They are often born to become exceptionally talented or knowledgeable in specific fields, such as music, art, or specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Their incarnation can be to complete unfinished karmic tasks, fulfill desires, or for the benefit of humanity (Lok Kalyan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:09">[02:21:09]</a>. While in human form, they generally do not remember their past as higher beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:55">[02:21:55]</a>. Their inherent tendencies (samaskaras) guide them back to their spiritual path, which often involves recovering past spiritual progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.

## Protection and Practice
To protect oneself from negative entities, it is crucial to perform `upasana` (worship and practice) of a main deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. The more spiritualized and meditative one becomes, the more protected they are from darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:45">[02:25:45]</a>. Entering these spiritual realms out of mere curiosity is strongly discouraged, as it can be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. The guidance of a competent Guru is essential in navigating these complex realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

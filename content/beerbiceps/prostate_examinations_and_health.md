The prostate is a small, walnut-sized organ situated between the urinary bladder and the urethra (the conduit for urine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>. Its primary [[role_and_function_of_the_prostate_gland | function]] is to produce semen, which is the fluid in which sperms thrive and are carried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:53">[01:58:53]</a>. Sperms themselves originate from the testes, while semen is the fluid medium, typically 2 to 5 ml per ejaculate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>. As a male organ, its function is controlled by [[mens_psychological_and_physiological_health_relating_to_testosterone | testosterone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:27">[01:59:27]</a>.

## Prostate Enlargement (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - BPH)

Around the fourth decade of life, changes in hormones, particularly the balance between estrogen and [[mens_psychological_and_physiological_health_relating_to_testosterone | testosterone]], can lead to the proliferation of cells within the prostate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:33">[01:59:33]</a>. This proliferation can cause the prostate to increase in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. If the outer capsule of the prostate is not elastic, this enlargement can compress the urinary passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Symptoms of prostate enlargement include:
*   Frequent urge to urinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:29">[02:00:29]</a>
*   Urgency, potentially leading to leakage before reaching the washroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>
*   Difficulty initiating the urine stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>
*   A prolonged or broken urine stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>
*   Dribbling at the end of urination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>
*   A persistent feeling of incomplete bladder emptying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>

While all men over 40 may show some histological (microscopic) changes of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>, not all will experience clinical symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:56">[02:01:56]</a>. Some men can have prostates as large as 200 grams without experiencing issues, especially if the capsule is elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:10">[02:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:20">[02:03:20]</a>. A normal prostate gland is typically around 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:21">[02:02:21]</a>. There is a suggestion of a familial predisposition to prostate enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:24">[02:01:24]</a>.

## Prostate Examinations

Regular [[role_and_function_of_the_prostate_gland | prostate examinations]] are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)
A digital rectal examination (DRE) involves a doctor inserting a finger to feel the prostate. If performed correctly, it should not hurt the patient; if it does, the fault lies with the doctor's technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>. The technique involves proper lubrication, patient comfort, distraction through conversation, and a slow, careful insertion to allow muscles to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:03">[02:04:03]</a>.

Traditionally, DREs were used to ascertain prostate enlargement and to check for prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>. A normal prostate feels firm, similar to the tip of the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a>. A cancerous prostate feels hard, like a stone or a pearl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>.

### Modern Diagnostic Methods
Today, alternatives to DRE are commonly used for initial assessment:
*   **Ultrasound:** This imaging technique provides information on the prostate's weight, volume, shape, and its effect on the bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **PSA Blood Test:** Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a blood test that can indicate prostate issues. If a patient has a normal PSA, a rectal examination for cancer may not be immediately necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:42">[02:05:42]</a>. A rising PSA over time could indicate a potential cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:03">[02:06:03]</a>.
*   **MRI:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be used to detect cancer if there's doubt or if a DRE doesn't reveal a palpable mass despite concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:51">[02:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>.

DREs are still relevant when a patient has a diagnosed prostate cancer and a robotic surgery is planned. The examination helps the surgeon feel the prostate to determine if it's stuck to the rectum, aiding in safe surgical removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.

## Prostate Removal
The transcript asks why so many men need their prostate removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. While it highlights the symptoms and diagnostic methods, it doesn't detail the removal procedure itself. However, it can be inferred that removal, or interventions, are sought when the prostate enlargement causes significant urinary symptoms or in cases of prostate cancer.

## Connection to Overall Male Health
Prostate health, like many other bodily functions, is significantly influenced by lifestyle factors and [[the_impact_of_lifestyle_on_male_testosterone_levels | testosterone levels]]. The hormone balance, especially concerning estrogen and testosterone, is affected by factors such as fat accumulation, which can lead to increased aromatase enzyme activity, converting testosterone into estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:33">[01:59:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This connection underscores the broader importance of a healthy lifestyle for male physiological well-being.

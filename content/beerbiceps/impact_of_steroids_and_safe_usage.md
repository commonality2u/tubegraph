Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, has openly discussed his experiences with steroid use throughout his career, emphasizing the critical importance of safety and professional guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. He attributes his ability to use them without major health complications to a disciplined approach and constant medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Steroids

Ronnie Coleman first used steroids around 1995 or 1996, at the age of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. He recalls being "so afraid to do all that stuff back then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. He received information and guidance from fellow bodybuilder Flex Wheeler, who was "quite honest" and whose advice "worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

Coleman states that the dosages he took were "normal" and not "massive amounts," believing that excessive use would have prevented him from being alive today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. He describes the changes to his body as gradual, realizing the full extent of his transformation only after seeing himself in magazines, as he was not a "mirror person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

### Health and Monitoring
A crucial aspect of Coleman's steroid use was continuous medical monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. He ensured that everything he put into his body was "doctor prescribed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. Every four months, he would undergo checkups to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were functioning correctly, and he "never had a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. This dedication to health, alongside training, contributed to his great physique on stage and his healthy appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. He observed other bodybuilders with "pimples" and "red marks" on their skin, which he consciously avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

Coleman notes that even with increased testosterone from steroid use, his sex drive decreased during preparation for shows, as his body was not "used to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. His focus was solely on winning the Olympia, making sex irrelevant to his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

## Safe Usage and Risks

Coleman stresses that a doctor's guidance is essential when considering steroid use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. He advises against going longer than six months without checking one's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. He believes that steroids can easily go wrong if not used safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. He spent a significant amount of time reading books and researching to ensure his usage was "as safe as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

Coleman observes a culture in both the US and India where gym trainers provide steroids to young individuals, including teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. He expresses concern that these young users may not be aware of the necessary accompanying substances needed to protect organs like the liver, kidneys, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. He attributes this unsafe practice to a "lust for that kind of a body," where individuals prioritize size over [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | bodily health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

## Identifying Steroid Use

Coleman asserts that he is able to identify when someone has likely used steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. Key indicators include:
*   **Body Shape and Thickness**: The specific shape and thickness of muscles, particularly shoulders, can suggest non-natural development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. For actors like Chris Hemsworth, such a physique is "not naturally achievable" because they are not athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Definition and Cuts**: A very "cut up" body with widespread definition, like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's, is "very unlikely" to be natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.
*   **Low Body Fat**: Combined with significant muscle mass, a very low body fat percentage can also be an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

Conversely, Ronnie Coleman considers physiques like Cristiano Ronaldo's and Mike Tyson's at their peak, or Brock Lesnar's, to be naturally achievable through hard work and genetic gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. These individuals often lack the extreme definition or "thickness" seen in those who use performance-enhancing drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.

Coleman also notes that steroid use does not need to be continuous to maintain a physique. He himself only used them for "certain time" when competing, such as "seven months on five months off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>, or potentially "two or three months out of the year" for someone like John Cena, who only needs to appear a certain way periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

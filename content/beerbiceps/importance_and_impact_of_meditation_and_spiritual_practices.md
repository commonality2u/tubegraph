Meditation and spiritual practices are presented as crucial tools for personal growth, protection, and understanding the world. They are believed to offer significant benefits for mental well-being and a deeper connection to broader energies.

## Benefits of Meditation
[[Importance of Meditation | Meditation]] is highlighted as a process through which individuals can better protect and guard themselves, leading to personal evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38">[01:38]</a>. The podcast host even launched a meditation app, Level Supermind, to help people on their spiritual journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>.

The act of [[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | meditation]] helps individuals perceive the world more clearly, recognizing the reality of both negative and highly positive aspects of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. It's akin to building a muscle, requiring patience and consistent effort to yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

## Role of Spirituality and Spiritual Practices
The importance of spiritual practices extends to counseling people who are experiencing depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>, and facilitating "inner child healing" and "generational healing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09">[09:09]</a>. From a spiritual viewpoint, existence after suicide is considered potentially worse than the life lived before, emphasizing the value of continued existence and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53">[09:53]</a>.

A daily energetic awakening is encouraged, acknowledging each day as a gift not afforded to spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19">[10:19]</a>.

### Energy and Protection
The human body possesses electricity and charges, as understood through concepts like neurons transferring electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:57">[46:57]</a>. This internal energy is also noted in spiritual contexts, such as the efficacy of Reiki healing for physical ailments, even without a scientific explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47">[45:47]</a>. Practices like Tai Chi demonstrate the human body's capacity to project energy, where practitioners can feel "a ball of energy" in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21">[46:21]</a>.

This concept extends to prayer; when people pray, something leaves their body, potentially a message from their mind or an electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20">[47:20]</a>. When many people pray together in one space, a significant amount of this "electricity" or energy can accumulate, leading to measurable Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) and a sense of satisfaction in religious places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32">[47:32]</a>. Abandoned temples and churches still retain these EMFs, indicating a residual energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48">[48:48]</a>.

[[The role of meditation and spirituality in protection | Spiritual practices and symbols]] serve as a means of protection against negative entities and energies:
*   **Symbols**: Om, Swastika, and Yantras in India are used for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Other protective symbols include the Pentacle, the Eye of Hamsa, Thor's hammer, and Celtic knots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   **Tattoos**: Tattoos of protective symbols, like sigils of Archangel Michael and Archangel Raphael, are believed to integrate foreign elements into one's DNA, offering protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. These can be "activated" to enhance their protective qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Crystals**: Crystals are considered powerful tools from nature with abilities for healing, protection, and shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. They can absorb negativity and need to be charged periodically using natural energies like moonlight or sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Meditating near crystals with intention can also charge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

### Understanding Divine and Demonic Energies
Spirituality acknowledges "ascended masters" who are believed to provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. The concept of "Mata Ana phenomena" describes when a positive deity possesses a receptive individual to provide answers and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. This channeling of divine energies is observed in spiritual individuals and psychics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

Conversely, the existence of negative entities is acknowledged. Religions are thought to have created the concept of demons to encourage faith in God by instilling fear of a darker alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. While some people engage in rituals involving negative deities for material gains or curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>, there's a strong emphasis on the importance of distinguishing between genuine spiritual phenomena and psychological issues or deliberate hoaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

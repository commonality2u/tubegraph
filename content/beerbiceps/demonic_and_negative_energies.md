In discussions concerning Tantra and the occult, a hierarchy of negative entities and their interactions with human beings is described. These entities are believed to exist on the [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | astral plane]], which overlaps with the physical realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

## Types of Negative Entities

### Bhoots (Discarnate Entities)
Bhoots are described as discarnate entities, resembling human beings but lacking a physical body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. They may possess human desires like hunger, anger, or lust, and remain trapped in this plane, unable to progress further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. If agitated, they can cause trouble to individuals in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. Sometimes, a Bhoot may not even realize it is a ghost and attempts to interact with the living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

A specific type of Bhoot is a 'Pitu' (ancestor) who has died but is stuck in a particular realm called Pitru Loka, a part of the astral plane, unable to take rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. They might project their problems onto living descendants due to strong genetic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. Rituals performed in specific places like Trimbakeshwar, Gaya, or Kashi can help calm these spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

### Pretas (Angry Spirits)
Pretas are described as very angry spirits, often former human beings who were in a negative state due to twisted karmas or violent deaths, such as accidents or suicide at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. They can cause various troubles, including diseases, obstructions in work, and accidents to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Their presence might lead to recurring strange negative occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

### Pishachas (Extremely Dangerous Entities)
Pishachas are considered more dangerous than Pretas, likened to a "mad bull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Brahma Pishacha:** This type originates from highly knowledgeable spiritual practitioners who misused or hoarded their knowledge, or became greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Non-human Pishachas:** Many Pishachas were never human at all and are inherently dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

These entities are confined to specific areas characterized by extreme negative energy, dark and filthy settings, and often a recurring foul odor without a discernible source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. They are unreasonable and irrational, seeking to influence and gain attention by causing disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. They dislike the vibrations of higher mantras (e.g., Shiva, Vishnu, Durga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

### Rakshasas and Asuras (Highest Negative Beings)
Rakshasas and Asuras represent the highest level of negative entities in Indian Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. They are extremely powerful, akin to gods in a negative sense, and are unlikely to incarnate physically in the current era due to the lack of human capacity to withstand them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

Asuras possess exceptional intelligence, mastery of logic, and profound knowledge of scriptures and spiritual realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. They are not atheists; they fully acknowledge the existence of gods but choose to misuse their powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. Their influence primarily affects the minds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:11:00]</a>. Historical texts like the Ramayana describe Asuras destroying yagyas (fire rituals) and necessitating intervention from divine figures like Lord Rama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

It is believed that [[demonic_possession_and_exorcism | demonic possession and exorcism | Asuric influences]] can be tied to huge amounts of wealth, which may lead individuals to engage in unrighteous or negative actions to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

## Interaction and Influence
Negative entities interfere with individuals and their spiritual practices for various reasons:
*   **Disruption:** Their nature is to cause disturbance and feed on the disruption they create in people's sadhana (spiritual practice) and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. They aim to break the rhythm of practice, causing energy to fall and preventing spiritual progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Influence:** They can influence thoughts, leading to extreme negativity, violence, or even thoughts of murder or suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. They might also instigate conflicts in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Such thoughts are often external and not originating from one's own mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Dreams:** Negative entities can enter and cause harm through dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.
*   **Attraction:** Passing through a haunted place can cause an entity to "stick" to an individual, often due to a past karmic link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Engaging in foolish practices like using Ouija boards or other spirit-calling activities can easily invite these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

Some [[demonic_possession and exorcism | demonic entities]] can even pose as positive deities, appearing with effulgence and power, and granting desires that align with an individual's secret greed or impatience for fast results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. This happens when an individual's deep-seated desires override their stated spiritual intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:53">[02:28:53]</a>.

## Protection and Countermeasures
[[combatting_negative_energies | Combatting negative energies]] and entities primarily involves spiritual self-protection:
*   **Upasana (Devotion and Practice):** The most effective way for an average person is to perform upasana (devotional practice) to a main deity and learn to protect oneself, especially during an overlap or interaction with these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Meditation and Spirituality:** The more one meditates and spiritualizes oneself, the greater the ability to protect against darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. [[spirituality_meditation_and_maintaining_a_positive_aura | Meditation]] protects the mind and maintains stability, especially in dark moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Specific Deities:** Certain deities, like Lord Hanuman and Bhairava, are considered excellent protectors and respond faster due to their closer proximity to the Earth plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The Hanuman Chalisa is particularly potent as an anti-ghost power due to Lord Hanuman's nature as an immortal protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Regular recitation of Hanuman Chalisa with faith and discipline, along with celibacy and meditation on Lord Rama, can lead to transformative experiences and strong protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Guru's Guidance:** A competent Guru is crucial for guidance, especially when dealing with complex spiritual experiences or negative encounters, as they can help discern what to take seriously and what not to get attached to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. A genuine Guru belongs to a "Guru Parampara" (lineage) with at least three generations of accomplished gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Inner Space:** High-level yogic practices can allow one to enter a deep inner space within the heart or beyond time, which is pure enough to hold divine presence and where even the most dangerous entities cannot enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Skepticism and Belief
Regarding [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | skepticism]] towards these phenomena, it is acknowledged that rational arguments alone are often insufficient to convince a skeptic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. Instead, personal experiences are seen as the most profound way to shift perspective. An experience outside the normal realm of existence can lead to shock and a change in worldview, even for a strong skeptic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Engaging with diverse perspectives and seeking genuine spiritual practitioners can lead to inexplicable experiences that challenge rational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

## Karmic Implications
The use of occult powers for material ambition or to harm others incurs Karmic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. While prayer has no negative karmic consequence, demanding specific results through practices with underlying greed or desire for fast success will incur a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This could manifest as personal injury, illness, or other life issues for the practitioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Only when a deity explicitly permits a practice at very high stages of sadhana is the Karma handled divinely, not by the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. The importance lies in understanding if one can sustain the impact of such karmas before engaging in these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

## Role of Spirituality and Witchcraft in Paranormal Phenomena
The [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | occult aspect of Tantra]] is particularly popular in politics and film industries for influencing events, boosting careers, or removing enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This involves "Prayog" (application of power), which can be used for positive (e.g., healing, job success) or negative purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.

## Cultural Perceptions
[[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | Cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits]] vary, but ancient Indian culture, particularly through Tantra and Dharma, provides detailed classifications of these entities and their interactions. This knowledge aims to educate people about "darker concepts" but also emphasizes moving towards light and goodness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The spiritual path involves self-discipline and continuous effort, as nature acts as a filtering mechanism to ensure that only those truly dedicated achieve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

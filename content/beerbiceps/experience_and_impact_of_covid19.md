The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the life and perspective of the speaker, leading to profound personal and professional shifts.

## Personal Health Battle and Recovery
The speaker contracted COVID-19 shortly before this interview, experiencing a high fever and low oxygen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Despite having been working out hectically and shooting days prior, attributing fatigue to overexertion, the symptoms rapidly worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. They were rushed to Continental Hospitals in Hyderabad and received top-notch treatment, being discharged after five days of hospitalization, followed by quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The experience was "really scary" as it was their first hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### Post-Recovery Challenges
Immediately after recovering from COVID-19, while on heavy medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, the speaker received insensitive comments about looking "a little fat" in pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This highlighted a perceived insensitivity in people who might judge someone recovering from illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Profound Shifts in Perspective
The [[the_impact_of_the_pandemic_on_the_indian_film_industry | COVID-19 pandemic]], particularly the lockdown phase, served as a significant "reality check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, prompting deep introspection and changes in life priorities.

### Re-evaluation of Happiness and Peace
The speaker realized that "there is never this point that we will actually be completely happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, acknowledging a persistent "void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This led to a conscious effort to "enjoy the small things" in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, such as eating chips with friends in comfortable clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The primary void in their life now is the search for peace, especially given their demanding work schedule that often blurs weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Redefined Career Goals and Pace of Life
The speaker acknowledged having lived at a "very crazy pace" pre-COVID, trying to do "10 things in a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The lockdown made them realize the importance of doing one thing peacefully at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Their focus has shifted from long-term projections (e.g., "10 years down the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>) to finding daily satisfaction in work, stating, "I sleep well when I have a good day at work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This includes being fully present in interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Existential Contemplation and Self-Acceptance
The experience triggered existential questions about purpose and meaning, similar to a common feeling of emptiness even after professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The speaker, who began journaling with the question "who am I" at age 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, now believes the answer lies in not "obsessing about it" and simply "chilling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### Increased Gratitude
The pandemic fostered a greater sense of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. The speaker now makes a conscious and proactive effort to thank pivotal people in their life, recognizing that they cannot achieve much without the help of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. They pray for small, basic things that make their day better, feeling that larger gifts have already been provided by the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

## Key Learnings
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a> When asked to condense 30 years of life into three learnings, the speaker offered these takeaways, heavily influenced by their recent experiences:
*   **No right time, only now:** "The right time is now. Take action. Don't wait." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>
*   **Don't try too hard:** "Don't try too hard." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>
*   **Seize happiness in small moments:** "Seize every moment to be happy whatever that it could be something small do that small thing that makes you happy not not the bigger things because those things seldom in your hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

Krishna's incarnation is fundamentally different from other avatars, manifesting glory from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. His story is seen as a heartbeat in India, appealing to people in diverse ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. For those who come into contact with Krishna, it is believed to be their last birth (janam), meaning they will not return to the cycle of samsara chakra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>.

## The Story of Krishna's Birth

Krishna's story is predominantly found in the Bhagavat Puranam, also known as Shrimad Bhagavatam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This text is considered the body of Vishnu, with its 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 syllables of the Vasudeva mantram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. While the Bhagavat Puranam focuses on his early life, aspects of Krishna's life also appear in the Mahabharatam and other Puranas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.

### Janmashtami and the Night of Delusion

Janmashtami, Krishna's birthday, is celebrated according to the lunar calendar in the month of Shravana, specifically on the Ashtami (eighth day) of the dark half (Krishna Paksha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. This Ashtami is always dedicated to Kaala Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

The night of Janmashtami is called "Moharatri" (night of delusion) because of the magical events surrounding his arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. It is one of four phenomenal nights in Sanatana Dharma where the power of the Divine becomes extremely accessible, along with Kaalaratri (Deepawali), Maharatri (Mahashivaratri), and Daruna (Akshaya Tritiya) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Birth in Prison

Krishna was born to Vasudeva and Devaki, who were imprisoned by Devaki's cousin, Kamsa, the tyrannical king of Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. An Akashavani (voice in the heavens) had prophesied that Kamsa's death would come from Devaki's eighth child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>. Initially, Kamsa only cared about the eighth child, but Narada instigated him to kill all previous children, leading Kamsa to constantly think of the eighth child – Krishna – thus becoming a "Bhay Yogi" (yogi through fear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.

At the moment of his appearance, Krishna (Vishnu) immediately showed Devaki and Vasudeva his divine form (Swarupam) with Shankha, Chakra, Gada, and Padma, before transforming into a baby boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. This demonstrates that his glory manifested from the first second of his arrival, unlike Rama, who pretended to be a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>.

### The Exchange and Arrival in Gokul

Krishna instructed Vasudeva to take him across the Yamuna River to Gokul, to the house of Nanda and Yashoda, and exchange him with a baby girl born there on the same night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.

As Vasudeva carried baby Krishna in a basket on his head, Adishesha (the eternal couch of Narayana) appeared to shield the boy from the pouring rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. The Yamuna River, in full spate, rose to touch Krishna's feet for a blessing, then parted, allowing Vasudeva to cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

A lesser-known version of the story (found in other Puranas like Brahma Purana) states that Nanda and Yashoda had given birth to a beam of light along with a baby girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>. When Vasudeva placed Krishna in their house, this beam of light merged with Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>. This signifies that for Krishna's avatar, both Vishnu from Vaikuntha and Krishna from Goloka merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>. This is why Krishna is also called "Nandasamabhava" (one born from Nanda), not just adopted by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>.

The baby girl exchanged was Vishnu's sister, Yoga Maya (Maya Shakti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a>. Her presence caused everyone to be deluded, ensuring the exchange went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. When Vasudeva returned with the girl, she cried, alerting the guards and Kamsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>. Kamsa attempted to kill her, but she slipped from his hands, ascended into the sky, and declared that his killer was on the other side of the Yamuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>. This Yoga Maya later becomes Subhadra, the sister of Krishna and Balarama, present in Puri Jagannath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>.

### Balarama: Krishna's Elder Brother

Balarama, Krishna's elder brother, was Devaki's seventh child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>. Before his birth, Vishnu instructed Yoga Maya to transfer the baby from Devaki's womb to Rohini's womb (another of Vasudeva's wives, who was in Gokul) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>. This act of "pulling" (Karana) led to Balarama's name, Sankarshana, meaning "one who is moved carefully from one womb and is kept onto the other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. Sankarshana also has a larger cosmic meaning, representing the centripetal and centrifugal forces that keep the Earth on its perfect axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. Balarama is a manifestation of Adishesha, Vishnu's eternal couch, similar to Lakshmana in Rama's avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.

### Early Life and Madura Leelas in Vrindavan

Krishna's early life in Gokul and Vrindavan is filled with "Madura Leelas" (sweet divine plays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:16">[01:53:16]</a>. These mostly involve interactions with nature—cows, birds, animals, and peacocks—reflecting his deep connection to the Earth (Bhudevi, his consort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:40">[01:50:40]</a>.

One notable Madura Leela is when Krishna subdues the five-headed snake Kalia (or Kalinga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. During a ball game, the ball fell into the Yamuna, terrorized by Kalia. Krishna jumped into the water and emerged dancing on Kalia's heads, driving him away from Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>.

Vrindavan is considered a special place where Krishna's leelas (divine plays) are not just historical events but happen every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:54">[02:04:54]</a>. Specific spots known as Rasasthali are closed by 7 PM because it is believed that Krishna, Radha, and the Gopis perform the Rasa Leela there nightly, unseen by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

### The [[significance_of_krishnas_interactions_with_radha_and_the_gopis | Significance of Krishna's Interactions with Radha and the Gopis]]

The Gopis and Gopa are not merely cowherds but are beings madly obsessed with Krishna, who drink the essence of the Paramatma with all their sense organs ("Go" refers to sense organs, "Pa" refers to drinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Being a Gopi means wanting Krishna alone, not anything from Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:30">[02:14:30]</a>.

The Rasa Leela is a profoundly spiritual event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. It begins on a full moon night (Sharad Purnima) when Krishna plays his flute, and only the Gopis hear his call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>. They leave everything to follow him, demonstrating the first stage of a seeker's journey: hearing and acting on the divine call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:12">[02:16:12]</a>.

Initially, each Gopi finds a personal Krishna dancing with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:42">[02:18:42]</a>. However, when they develop a fleeting thought of pride, believing they control such a Paramatma, Krishna disappears, teaching them humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. This leads to desperation, where they mimic Krishna, internalizing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>. Krishna returns when he chooses, not because they "caught" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>. The Rasa Leela then becomes a "dance of complete abandon," where they recognize his true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>. The [[significance_of_krishnas_interactions_with_radha_and_the_gopis | Rasa Leela]] is geometrically represented by the Shri Chakram, with Krishna at the Bindu (center) and the Gopis forming the concentric circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.

Radha is paramount in Krishna Bhakti; without her, Krishna is inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. Chanting "Radha Radha" is considered the fastest way to connect with Krishna, as she filters all other sounds and teaches the sense of love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:36">[02:28:36]</a>. Radha is believed to have instructed everyone in Vrindavan to chant Krishna's name, and then modified it to Radha's name because Krishna himself loved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:36">[02:58:36]</a>. Radha is also considered the complete manifestation of the divine feminine (Brahasini), able to transform into Sita to appear alongside Rama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:06">[03:15:06]</a>.

### Transition to Aishwarya Leelas

Upon hearing that Kamsa was still king in Mathura, Krishna decided to leave Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:46">[03:48:46]</a>. This departure was heart-wrenching for the Gopis, who pleaded and cried for him to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:07">[03:49:07]</a>.

Krishna went to Mathura, killed Kamsa and his associated rakshasas in a wrestling match, and re-established Ugrasena (Kamsa's father, whom Kamsa had imprisoned) as the king of Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:08">[03:50:08]</a>. After this, Krishna's divine plays (leelas) shifted from Madura Leelas to "Aishwarya Leelas," where he openly displayed his divinity (Aishwarat) without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:26">[04:00:26]</a>. This marks his entry into the events that lead to the [[krishnas_role_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharatam]], where he becomes a mentor and strategist for the Pandavas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:04">[04:06:04]</a>.

# The End of the Avatar

The Mahabharatam continues to discuss Krishna's life, especially in its 11th and 12th chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:11">[04:17:11]</a>. Krishna's ultimate mission was to cleanse the Earth of adharmic kings, using the Pandavas and Kauravas as a pretext for the Kurukshetra War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>. He also fulfilled his promise to his doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, who had been cursed to take three lives on Earth hating Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:27">[04:29:27]</a>. They incarnated as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha (killed by [[the_mythology_behind_narasimha_and_prahlada | Narasimha]]), Ravana and Kumbhakarna (killed by Rama), and finally Shishupala and Dantavakra (killed by Krishna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:25">[04:46:25]</a>.

After the Mahabharata war, Krishna lived for 36 more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:08">[05:03:08]</a>. The Mahabharatam mentions the curse placed on Krishna by Gandhari, the mother of the Kauravas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:08">[05:03:08]</a>. Overwhelmed by grief after the death of her 100 sons, she cursed Krishna to die silently by a hunter's arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:03">[05:06:03]</a>. Krishna accepted this smilingly, stating he would have chosen that path anyway, and her curse merely wasted her accumulated tapas (spiritual penance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:07">[05:06:07]</a>.

Krishna then returned to Dwarka, where he witnessed his own Yadu clan destroy itself through internal bickering, fulfilling another part of Gandhari's curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:53">[05:07:53]</a>. Finally, while sitting under a tree with his foot outstretched, a hunter mistook his foot for a deer's ear and shot him with a poisoned arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:21">[05:08:21]</a>. This marked the end of his avatar, as he returned to his eternal Goloka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:58">[05:09:58]</a>. Before his departure, he instructed Balarama to return first, who transformed into a white snake and entered the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:09">[05:09:09]</a>.

[[geopolitics_and_global_conflicts | Geopolitical situations]] and conflicts often necessitate the deployment of military forces for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid. Colonel Rajiv Ban, a veteran of the Indian Army, shares his experiences from various operations, highlighting the complexities, dangers, and human aspects of such missions.

## Combat Operations

Colonel Rajiv Ban's military career has predominantly involved counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in regions like Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23">[04:23]</a>. He has participated in over 100 combat situations, many of which were "fighting in built-up areas" (FIBUA) – urban environments with varied building layouts and demographics, making operations exceptionally challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48">[05:48]</a>. These situations often require snap decisions that can determine life or death, especially for those in his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>. A primary responsibility is to ensure that the number of troops who go into an operation is the same number that returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23">[05:23]</a>.

## Manipur Experience

Colonel Ban's first direct combat experience was in 1999 in Kargil and subsequently in Manipur with the Assam Rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09">[07:09]</a>. At the age of 24, he encountered a severe situation in Manipur where civilians questioned if he was "from India," indicating a deep sense of alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10">[08:10]</a>. Hindi books, newspapers, and movies were banned, and a parallel government run by local groups held significant sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>. This animosity stemmed from a lack of awareness and exploitation by anti-social elements with political motives, leading many young people to take up arms for a sense of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57">[08:57]</a>.

### Lessons Learned from Manipur

Colonel Ban's tenure in Manipur provided three significant lessons:
*   **Military Perspective (Assam Rifles):** The Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinel of the Northeast," is a highly adaptable force, composed of personnel from diverse backgrounds across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57">[12:57]</a>. They demonstrated exceptional proficiency in local languages, particularly Gorali Napes, and shared common eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20">[13:20]</a>. The long tenure of its jawans, some serving until age 60, provided invaluable experience in combat situations, including detailed knowledge of terrain and potential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>.
*   **Militant Perspective:** Unlike other conflict zones, militant groups in Manipur operated with a strong ethical and moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16">[15:16]</a>. They would publicly apologize for any misconduct by their members, publish inquiry results, and strictly avoided harming women, children, or elderly people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30">[15:30]</a>. Military personnel with their families were considered safe, a unique code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06">[16:06]</a>.
*   **Civilian Perspective:** Colonel Ban observed that respecting the local population – their age, gender, and traditions – led to a supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34">[16:34]</a>. He even attended local dance festivals and marriage functions unarmed, relying on the host's invitation as an "insurance policy" for his safety, which was always upheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01">[17:01]</a>. This demonstrated that the situation in an area is often a reflection of how one engages with its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35">[17:35]</a>.

## Jammu & Kashmir

Colonel Ban advises against relying solely on media portrayals of the Kashmir situation, urging international and Indian audiences to visit as tourists to understand the reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34">[18:34]</a>. He highlights the visible military presence—soldiers protecting tourists every ten steps—and questions who would volunteer to visit if these protective forces were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07">[19:07]</a>. He believes that recent political decisions, specifically the revocation of certain sections, have significantly improved the environment, making the military's task easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47">[19:47]</a>.

He recounts seeing signs in Srinagar stating, "Indian Army and dogs are not allowed," and Pakistani flags, which deeply angered him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09">[20:09]</a>. He also recalls incidents where routes were blocked by locals while attempting to move the body of a fallen soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31">[20:31]</a>. Today, he notes, the Indian flag flies proudly at Lal Chowk, and the agencies causing chaos have been neutralized, indicating a significant cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05">[21:05]</a>.

## Airborne Forces

Colonel Rajiv Ban represents Airborne forces, a specialized military branch that operates from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. These units are distinct from Special Forces like Para SF, MARCOS, or Garuda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26">[32:26]</a>. Every individual in an Airborne unit is trained and capable of jumping from an aircraft traveling at 600 km/h with full combat load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02">[31:02]</a>. They can operate in diverse and challenging terrains, including jungles, urban areas, high altitudes, and snow-covered peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46">[31:46]</a>.

Airborne operations inherently carry a high casualty rate due to the risks involved in landing, especially in unpredictable terrains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36">[34:36]</a>. Colonel Ban recalls one operation where a three-hour journey turned into 36 hours due to unexpected ground conditions, leading to exhaustion and dehydration among troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55">[34:55]</a>. The training for Airborne forces emphasizes survival instincts and requires individuals to volunteer and undergo rigorous probation, including the Paracourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00">[36:00]</a>.

Night jumps, while seemingly more challenging, are considered by Colonel Ban to be "more exotic" and beautiful due to the clear aerial views of lights and the pin-drop silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34">[43:34]</a>. These jumps test reflexes, stimulus, and mental and physical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:05">[44:05]</a>.

He recounted a harrowing night jump incident where the static line cable broke, causing three soldiers to fall to their deaths without their parachutes deploying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:49">[40:49]</a>. Despite the tragedy, the remaining troops were immediately ordered to jump again the same night to prevent fear from spreading and to reinforce their professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51">[42:51]</a>. This ritual underscores the mindset that such incidents are a part of the job and cannot be allowed to create lasting fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11">[43:11]</a>.

## United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Africa

Colonel Ban served as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Sudan, specifically in the Abyei region during a period of intense turmoil (around 2007-2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>. He describes Abyei as one of the worst places globally, characterized by extreme poverty, lack of basic resources like water (which was costlier than oil), and sophisticated weaponry among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50">[51:50]</a>. He witnessed people drinking cow's blood for thirst and eating boot polish or medicines out of sheer hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03">[52:03]</a>. Life had no value, and people would kill for a piece of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46">[51:46]</a>.

The [[geopolitics_and_foreign_policy | political situation]] was marked by instability, with numerous militant groups fighting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35">[53:35]</a>. Colonel Ban recounted an incident where two military contingents were taken hostage, leading his team—comprised of members who won the tough Camon Patrol competition—to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07">[54:07]</a>. Facing hundreds of armed individuals firing indiscriminately, Colonel Ban chose diplomacy over force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07">[55:07]</a>. He approached the militant leader, who he described as more than a warlord, as "the only Lord" in that chaotic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. By maintaining composure, conveying respect, and asserting his own force's capabilities, he managed to de-escalate the situation and facilitate a meeting between the UN and the militant group, ultimately resolving the crisis without firing a single bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32">[56:32]</a>.

He witnessed horrific acts, including people playing football with human heads, reflecting a complete lack of structure and the absolute corruption of power when necessity drives humanity to its extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. He also recalls a direct order to not provide water or food to civilians outside their base, an order he defied by discreetly sharing his own rations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>. He realized that while military operations presented "challenges," the extreme suffering he witnessed in Africa was a different, more painful reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. He demonstrated the harsh realities of this environment to a group of Indian schoolchildren by showing them photographs of people drinking cattle urine and scavenging for food, driving home a powerful lesson about gratitude and avoiding waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>.

## Reflections on Military Life

Colonel Ban emphasizes that the [[brotherhood_and_responsibility_in_highstress_operations | Indian Army]] is the "biggest and best brand in the entire world," with soldiers capable of fighting and surviving on minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36">[00:36]</a>. He attributes their strength to unparalleled endurance—mental and physical—and unwavering patriotism that transcends personal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21">[29:21]</a>. He asserts that it is the "men behind the machine" who make the difference, not merely the weapon profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06">[30:06]</a>.

He advises aspiring military personnel that being a soldier is "by heart, not by uniform," stressing that one can serve the nation in any capacity with the right attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. His approach to difficult memories is to take things as they come, leaving negative experiences behind and retaining only the lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

### Survival Training and [[interaction_with_nature_in_military_settings | Nature]]

As part of his Commando training and in camps he conducted, survival skills included eating anything that "walks, crawls, creeps, or flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. This involved consuming raw and cooked snakes (which he describes as tasteless) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>, insects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>, and snails (which he found "creepy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>, as well as drinking muddy or even fecal-contaminated water after rudimentary filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. These practices are not for luxury but for survival, preparing soldiers for situations where no other food or water sources are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. During his travels, he also sampled exotic meats like crocodile, giraffe, and ostrich, finding them better than chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

He generally views wild animals as "friendly" as long as they are not provoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. He recounted an instance of a cheetah following his team at a distance for a kilometer, eventually slipping away without incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.

All India Bakchod (AIB) was once recognized as the top media company in the world of the Indian internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The company's journey, from its ambitious beginnings to its eventual disintegration, offers significant insights into the media industry and personal growth.

## Early Days and Funding
In its nascent stages, before YouTube provided substantial income, AIB's co-founder Tanmay Bhat personally funded his startup by offering weight loss coaching to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. One of his first clients, Tanay B, became a mentor to him in the media industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Disintegration and Aftermath
The disintegration of AIB was a profoundly difficult period for its founders and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A key challenging moment was the decision to let go of all AIB employees, which led to a breakdown and tears from Tanmay Bhat in front of the entire office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This difficult decision stemmed from the company's severe financial struggles. AIB was not a funded company and relied on reinvesting its earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Overnight, all brand partnerships disappeared, leading to significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Projects already shot could not be released, and the company was in the middle of producing a show for Amazon, incurring substantial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

During this period, Tanmay Bhat found himself without an office to go to, spending a couple of months eating, sleeping, and questioning his self-worth outside of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This marked a period of profound personal reinvention and enlightenment, making it both the "darkest" and "best" year of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Employee Success Post-AIB
Despite the closure, AIB's legacy as an institution became evident. Tanmay Bhat envisioned AIB as a place that would provide a "degree" for its employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. In hindsight, every individual who worked at AIB successfully secured higher-paying jobs and are currently thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Some even founded their own companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

The AIB social media team, for instance, established their own company called One Hand Clap, in which Tanmay Bhat invested. They now manage AIB's social media while also pursuing their independent ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. These young entrepreneurs, aged 22-23, even helped AIB repay a portion of its debt, viewing AIB as their "home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Current Status of AIB and Founders
While the AIB YouTube channel is currently inactive, other projects are in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. A movie, "Chintu," is in development, and a show is set to be released on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Additionally, two movies are being presented by AIB, indicating ongoing production activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The individual founders, including Rohan Joshi and Ashish Shakya, are pursuing their own projects, with some shooting comedy specials for Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Lessons Learned
Reflecting on AIB's journey, Tanmay Bhat identified key lessons:
*   **Delegation and Leadership**: He regrets not hiring a CEO solely focused on company operations, as his role as an artist often impaired his judgment in prioritizing business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **Insecurity in Leadership**: He recognized that his own insecurities as a leader manifested in ways that were not always beneficial for his employees, emphasizing that secure leaders foster better environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Patience and Long-term Games**: The experience taught him the virtue of patience, emphasizing that life is long and not everything needs to happen immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. He advocates for playing long-term games rather than focusing solely on immediate gratification, a common pitfall in the social media era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Self-awareness**: He realized that those who are least accepting of others' flaws often lack self-introspection and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Hustle and Void-Filling**: The intense "hustle" during the startup phase, while seemingly productive, indicated a "void" being filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He suggests that while hustle is important in early career stages, the meaning of life should not be solely equated with career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Talent Spotting**: When looking for new talent, he prioritizes "brokenness" as an indication of drive, and "lazy geniuses" who can find efficient solutions over mere hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. He also looks for fearless, malleable individuals with radical thinking, fostering an environment where young people are encouraged to grow and eventually pursue their own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

AIB's journey serves as a compelling narrative of ambition, challenges, and resilience, providing valuable lessons for both aspiring entrepreneurs and individuals navigating personal and professional setbacks.

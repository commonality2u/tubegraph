Dr. Savio Fado, a demonologist and psychic, provides insights into the existence of portals and haunted objects, drawing from his extensive experience in [[Interactions with Ghosts and Entities | paranormal investigations]] and exorcisms. He emphasizes a scientific yet pragmatic approach to understanding these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>.

## Haunted Objects and Collections

Dr. Fado's personal collection includes objects that harbor entities, which he jokingly refers to as "demonic pets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. These objects are acquired from haunted locations or private cases where individuals wish to discard them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. The most intense object in his collection is a large mirror that can open a portal for multiple entities to traverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This mirror is kept covered to prevent entities from going in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.

## Mirrors as Portals

A portal is defined as a "doorway" or "entryway" to another world or dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. While not all mirrors are portals, they can potentially become so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Mirrors facing each other can create an endless loop, forming a passage for otherworldly entities to enter this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. This phenomenon is acknowledged in practices like Vastu and Feng Shui, which advise against placing mirrors opposite each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

> "A portal is a doorway, is an entryway for to the other world to the other side of the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>

### The Mirror World and Dimensions

The "other side" of a mirror portal is said to contain entities from different galaxies and dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. Humans primarily exist in the third dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. Dr. Fado illustrates this with an analogy: just as a three-dimensional person can easily move a two-dimensional object (like a coin on paper) outside its perceived boundaries, a higher-dimensional entity can effortlessly enter or exit our three-dimensional world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. For us, this might appear as magic or a sudden disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Mirrors, by creating endless impressions, can open these portals for beings from higher dimensions to manifest in our spiritual and energy realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Other Types of Portals

Beyond mirrors, other elements can create portals:
*   **Natural Portals** occur where three or four elements interact, such as water bodies or certain tree formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   **Man-Made Portals** can be created in a house if specific objects that emit high electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, or refrigerators, are strategically placed in a triangular configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. This can lead to entities visibly entering and exiting walls and doors, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed to hallucination if witnessed by multiple people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

## The Nature of Entities

Entities, when visually perceived, often resemble their previous human form, appearing as ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. They typically do not look scary, a portrayal often exaggerated by movies for dramatic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. An entity is only identifiable as unnatural if it performs actions impossible for a physical human, like walking through a wall or disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>.

### Ghosts vs. Demons
A key distinction is made between ghosts and demons:
*   **Ghosts** are the spirits of deceased humans who may not realize they are dead or refuse to cross over due to unresolved desires, attachments to property, or a desire for revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. They coexist with humans and typically only interact when recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>.
*   **Demons** are described as "free radicals of energy" that have never walked the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. If this energy is imbued with positive spiritual memory, it forms angels or spirit guides; if negative, it forms demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. Demons often target vulnerabilities in individuals, feeding off negative emotions like fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Entity Interaction and Manifestation
Entities can manifest in various ways:
*   **Physical Restraint:** A strong entity, particularly one strengthened by ritualistic activities, can physically restrain a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
*   **Animal Manifestation:** Entities can manifest through animals, such as leopards, snakes, or scorpions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.
*   **Poltergeist Activities:** Stronger entities can manipulate the physical realm, causing objects to move, break, or making loud noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.
*   **Illusions:** Demons can create illusions to manipulate and confuse individuals, such as mimicking voices or creating false visual cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.

## Ouija Boards and the Occult

Ouija boards, often seen as a game, can potentially act as a portal to invite entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. While the movement of the planchette is scientifically explained by the "ideomotor effect" (involuntary micro-muscle movements influenced by subconscious thought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, it can also be a form of manipulation by a demon or entity accessing memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

> "A Ouija board is very scientific, it's just a play thing it's nothing I mean too serious but you just cannot trivialize it again and just say okay fine you know what it's just a game board so you can play with it no you never know when it is just a playboard and when it can actually invite a demon from another or a dead entity from another Zone and so it's like playing blind dates with evil entities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>

The core of the [[Experiences and beliefs about the occult and paranormal | occult]] lies in intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>. If one intends for something, like a ritual or calling a spirit, to work, it *can* work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>. Any form of spirit communication, whether through Ouija boards or electronic voice phenomena (EVP), is considered a valid response if it reacts to a provided stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.

## Impact of Sun Exposure
While sunlight provides beneficial vitamin D for your [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | skin]] and [[effects_of_diet_lifestyle_and_stress_on_hair_health | hair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>, prolonged exposure to harsh sunlight can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

The sun contains UV rays that, upon contact with your hair and scalp, can destroy the epithelial cells essential for hair growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:44">[02:40:44]</a>. To protect your [[effects_of_diet_lifestyle_and_stress_on_hair_health | hair's health]], it is advisable to avoid prolonged exposure to harsh sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>.

## Effects of Sweat on Hair
Sweat, while a natural bodily function, can negatively impact your hair. It washes away the natural oils present on your scalp and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>. Furthermore, sweat is a combination of water, natural salts, and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:04">[03:06:04]</a>. Although the water may evaporate, the salts and proteins can crust up on your scalp and hair, leading to dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:04">[03:11:04]</a>.

To mitigate these effects:
*   After an intense cardio session or significant sweating, it is recommended to wash your hair with shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:04">[03:20:04]</a>.
*   Alternatively, you can schedule your shampooing sessions to coincide with your cardio workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:04">[03:26:04]</a>.
*   If you've been swimming, wash your hair immediately and thoroughly afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

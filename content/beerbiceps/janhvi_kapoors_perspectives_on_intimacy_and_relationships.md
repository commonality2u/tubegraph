Janhvi Kapoor shares her candid [[perspectives_on_love_relationships_and_personal_life | perspectives on love, relationships, and intimacy]], emphasizing the challenges faced in modern dating and her personal experiences with loneliness and self-discovery.

## The Modern Landscape of Intimacy
Janhvi Kapoor observes that intimacy has become highly accessible, which, paradoxically, makes people "too scared to commit" to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This convenience of access keeps individuals from forming "a real equation with anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. She reiterates this point later, stating that the accessibility of intimacy makes people "too intimidated" by it, preventing genuine connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

## Personal Relationship Status and Desires
Kapoor confirms that she is currently single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. While she is generally happy being single, she admits to feeling lonely at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. She reflects on why people might not approach her with romantic intentions, acknowledging she doesn't know the reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

She hopes her future boyfriend will "be nice to me and make me laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. She promises to be "good to you," "there for you," and capable of making him laugh, adding that she can be "a little psycho but also cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## Past Experiences and Guarding Energy
Kapoor attributes her feelings of loneliness more to "past experiences" than to her current self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. She suggests she is guarding her energy, as she has "wasted too much of my energy on people that didn't deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

Currently, her focus is not on finding a partner. She wishes for the universe to manifest "more films, more experiences, more growth, and more love from the audience" rather than a man, stating that "the man can wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

### Empathy and Healing
Janhvi identifies herself as an empath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:05:59]</a> and believes that empaths possess "healing energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. She suggests that during periods of angst, one might "attract things that need to be healed," even "in the other realm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. However, she expresses weariness with constantly attracting things that need healing, joking about her love life: "I only attract things that need to be healed. I'm sick of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

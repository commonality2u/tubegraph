Palki Sharma is recognized as a prominent figure in Indian [[journalism_and_content_creation_dynamics | journalism]] [00:00:00]. As the Managing Editor at First Post [00:01:52], her directness and depth of knowledge [00:03:17] have established her as a leading voice in global geopolitical narratives [00:03:51].

## Core Philosophy of Journalism

Palki Sharma emphasizes that her approach to journalism is centered on storytelling rather than algorithmic engagement.
> "When we do our stories, when we pick our stories, when we write our stuff, we are not thinking algorithms, we are thinking stories. I wouldn't even say content, we are thinking only stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

She believes in bringing a "fresh perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> and looking at "the other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> of multifaceted stories, such as viewing Africa as a continent of 54 diverse countries rather than a monolithic "problem riddled land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Global Reach and Vision for Indian Media

Sharma notes that First Post has a "wider Global reach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> due to its focus on international news, a niche not widely covered by other Indian media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. She attributes part of her recognition to her "directness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> and the viral spread of her work on social media [00:05:47].

However, she identifies a significant gap in India's global media presence:
> "We are nowhere in the picture compared to the rest of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, especially compared to outlets like Al Jazeera, BBC, RT, CNN, France 24, Channel NewsAsia, Washington Post, and New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
She argues that India "lack[s] vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> in building a "credible and impactful Global media presence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Role of Media in Soft Power and Legitimacy

Palki Sharma highlights media's crucial role in a nation's [[soft_power_and_indias_presence_in_international_media | soft power]] and legitimacy on the global stage. She cites examples like the US media's ability to frame the Iraq War as a "global war on terrorism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, showcasing how media narratives can "shape human viewpoints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

### The "Battle of Ideas"
In the current "Information Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, Palki Sharma asserts that "battlefields are not actually fields anymore; they're here in the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. She references Joseph Nye, who states that "legitimacy is a power reality in our world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. She laments that India is "sitting on the side lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a> in this global "Battle of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>, needing to invest resources to secure its legitimacy when questioned by external parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

## Challenges for Indian Journalists Abroad

Recalling her experience reporting from Israel, Palki Sharma notes that journalists, like soldiers, are among the few who enter a country during conflict while others leave [00:45:51]. She highlights the disparity in resources, particularly for Indian journalists, compared to their Western counterparts. She points out that some Indian reporters are "out on a limb trying to cover a war because they want to cover a war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>, often lacking "combat training or training for reporting in a conflict zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a> or proper gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. She feels that more "slack" should be given to Indian journalists for their passion and efforts under such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.

## Individuals vs. Institutions in Media
Palki Sharma acknowledges the growing influence of individual content creators and thought leaders in the age of "Paradox of Plenty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, where attention becomes scarce due to content overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. People turn to "queue givers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>—those with credibility—to filter noise and focus on important information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

However, she argues that individuals, while central, should aim to "create institutions that Outlast them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. She believes in the importance of building structures that "embody their ethos, their ideas, their vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, ensuring longevity and broader impact beyond one person's relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

## Audience Demographics

Sharma highlights a significant challenge in news consumption: a gender gap. She notes that "somewhere in the range of 80% of the news audience is male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, a pattern not limited to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This imbalance means that topics like women's issues often see lower viewership, despite their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. She urges women to become "active audience[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a> to ensure their "voice gets represented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a> and the media industry takes them seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

## Personal Perspective on the Field

Despite her influential position, Palki Sharma considers herself "just doing my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> and does not view her viewership as a "fan following" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, preferring to see her audience as discerning individuals who engage with ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. She states that all her extensive reading and life experiences contribute to shaping her worldview, which in turn informs her journalistic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

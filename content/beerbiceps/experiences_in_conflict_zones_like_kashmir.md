Major Vivek Jacob's extensive [[military_life_and_experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob | military career]] has included over a hundred [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat situations]] in various conflict zones across India and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. He emphasizes that the biggest and best brand in the world is the Indian Army, whose soldiers are potent and capable, able to fight battles surviving on minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. He states that Indian soldiers are unparalleled in their endurance, both mental and physical, and will not think about their families when it comes to duty for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Combat Operations and Challenges
Major Jacob's service has primarily involved [[combat_experiences_and_challenges_faced_by_major_vivek_jacob | counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations]] in regions such as Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. He prefers combat and training, considering everything else secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These duties provide immense satisfaction because they push individuals to their mental and physical thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

One of the most difficult types of operations is "Fighting In Built-Up Operations" (FIBUA), which involves combat in densely populated areas like Mumbai or Manipur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. These operations are challenging due to unpredictable layouts of buildings, varied demographics, and the close-quarters nature of engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### First Combat Experience
Major Jacob's first firsthand [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat experience]] began in 1999 when he joined his unit in Kargil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His most intense early exposure to combat was in Manipur, his first posting after joining the Assam Rifles, where they conducted two to three operations daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Near-Death Encounter in Manipur
Major Jacob recounts a terrifying experience in Manipur during a FIBUA operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Upon kicking open a door, he found an individual pointing a weapon directly at his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He describes going "blank" for a moment, but luck was on his side as the weapon failed to fire due to a technical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This brief delay allowed him to regain his senses and disarm the individual with a rifle butt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Learnings from Manipur
From his early days in Manipur, Major Jacob gained three key insights:

1.  **Military Perspective (Assam Rifles)**: He realized the Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinels of the Northeast," are an incredibly potent force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Composed of personnel from all over India, speaking multiple languages, they could operate smoothly anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Their jawans, some serving until age 60, possess unmatched experience, capable of providing invaluable advice in combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. They served as "walking encyclopedias," providing precise details on routes, potential threats, and past incidents without needing maps or GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

2.  **Militant Perspective**: He observed that militant groups in Manipur adhered to a strong ethical and moral code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Unlike Jammu & Kashmir, where such principles were often absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, these groups would publish apologies in newspapers for any transgressions by their members and hold inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. They never harmed ladies, children, or the elderly, and even when an officer or jawan was with their family in public, they were considered "walking insurance policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

3.  **Civilian Perspective**: He learned that respecting the local population – their age, gender, and the elderly – ensured safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. He recounts participating in local dances and attending marriage functions in remote areas at night without a weapon, relying solely on the trust extended by the locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This taught him that the situation in an area is as good or bad as the military personnel are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) Situation
Major Jacob urges international and Indian audiences not to rely on media or documentaries for their understanding of the Kashmir situation, but instead to visit as tourists to experience the reality firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. He notes that the constant presence of security forces for protection is a stark reality, and without them, ordinary citizens would not even cross the tunnel into Srinagar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

He asserts that the revocation of Article 370 has significantly improved the situation and made the military's task easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. He recalls a time in Srinagar where signs explicitly stated, "Indian army and dogs are not allowed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. He also witnessed instances where routes were blocked while trying to move a fallen soldier's body, and saw Pakistani flags and boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Today, he proudly states that the Indian flag (Teranga) flies at Lal Chowk, and the "stupid boards" and agencies creating havoc have been neutralized, indicating a significant cleanup of the environment, though it takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. He is confident that things will continue to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

## Weaponry in Conflict Zones
Major Jacob discusses the types of weapons used in conflict zones:
*   **Grenades**: He considers them "useless" based on his experience, as they often don't detonate on time and are rarely used in routine operations despite being carried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Grenades have a limited killing zone (roughly 2-3 meters) and are primarily used for bunker clearance or against enemies hiding in open ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)**: This is a modern, highly effective, and precise alternative to grenades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. It's tripod-mounted, stable, and can deliver pinpoint shots into small targets like bunkers from long distances (800-900 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
*   **Pistols**: Preferred in close-quarters combat within built-up areas due to their swiftness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. However, they have less accuracy and more recoil compared to larger weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **AK-47/56**: Preferred for operations in slightly more open areas, offering stability with its buttstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

Every unit has an authorized weapon profile based on its operational requirements and role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. While foreign militaries may have different equipment, Major Jacob asserts that the men behind the machines are what truly matter, and Indian soldiers are the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

## Experience with Airborne Forces
Major Jacob was part of the airborne forces, which operate from the air with unparalleled reach and penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Every individual in an airborne unit is capable of jumping from an aircraft at speeds of 600 km/h, fully loaded with weapons, into any terrain—jungles, urban areas, high altitudes, or snow-covered peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. This requires tremendous practice, courage, and a strong heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

Becoming part of airborne forces requires volunteering, willingness, successfully completing probation, and a Parachute Course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. There are no specific physical traits endorsed on paper; one must prove their worth on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

### Risks of Airborne Operations
Airborne operations inherently carry a high casualty rate. Soldiers understand that not everyone might make it successfully to the ground, especially when jumping into difficult terrain where clear landing zones are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. The percentage of casualties is highest in airborne operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.

Major Jacob shares an experience where a three-hour journey turned into 36 hours due to unforeseen ground conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Troops became exhausted and dehydrated, forced to drink muddy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. Despite the difficulty, completing the task brought high motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

He emphasizes the paramount responsibility of a leader to ensure that all troops who go into an operation come back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. He always told his men that if one person wasn't going to make it, it would be him, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

### The Psychology of Jumps
Every jump is a new experience, and even within a single jump, different positions in the aircraft (front, center, last) create distinct psychological states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. As a commanding officer, he preferred to be the first to exit the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. A delay of even a fraction of a second when the 'green light' signals to jump can cause a soldier to land outside the designated dropping zone (DZ) and cost lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

Major Jacob recounts a tragic night jump where the static cord of the parachutes for three soldiers broke, causing them to fall silently from 1,450 feet to their deaths without their parachutes deploying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Despite the fear, immediately after the bodies were moved, every remaining soldier was given a new parachute, boarded aircraft, and jumped again that very night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. This ritual was crucial to prevent a "fear factor" from setting in and to reinforce that such incidents, while tragic, are part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

He finds night jumps more "exotic" than challenging, offering a beautiful view of lights and clarity, testing reflexes, and mental and physical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

## [[Military experiences in international settings | International Experiences]]: Sudan
Major Jacob's [[military_experiences_in_international_settings | international experiences]] include a United Nations peacekeeping deployment to Abay, Sudan (then North and South Sudan) around 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. He describes it as one of the worst places in the world, with absolute barren terrains where water was costlier than oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. He witnessed people drinking cow blood for thirst and eating boot polish or medicines from garbage dumps due to extreme scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Life had no value, and people would kill for a piece of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. The region was plagued by political instability and numerous militant groups armed with sophisticated weapons, lacking any logical conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

He recounts a dangerous situation where two military contingents had previously been taken hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Major Jacob, with a small team of his best-trained soldiers (including those from the tough Cameron Patrol competition), ventured to negotiate with a powerful local "warlord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. Despite the armed, volatile crowd, he approached the leader with a confident smile, put his hand on his chest, and used the only common language—English—to explain his purpose: to arrange a meeting and ensure security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. He successfully convinced the leader to disperse his armed followers and create a conducive environment for a meeting, which ultimately resolved the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. He describes maintaining composure in such high-pressure situations as crucial for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

Major Jacob witnessed horrifying acts of barbarism, including people chopping off heads and playing football with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. He describes an instance of a pregnant lady being rescued from crossfire and people hanging children upside down to warn families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He defied orders by opening the gate to his base to provide shelter to a man with an amputated leg, an old lady, and children seeking refuge from the chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. He also defied orders by secretly sharing his water and food with starving locals, stating that while operations are challenges, what he saw in Sudan was unimaginable suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

## Commando Training and Survival
As part of commando training, soldiers are taught to eat anything that walks, crawls, creeps, or flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Major Jacob has eaten raw and cooked snakes and insects multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. He notes that while snakes are tasteless, snails were the worst thing he had to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. The training emphasizes that in survival situations, there is no luxury of choice; the goal is simply to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. He also experienced drinking muddy and even "shitty water," learning to filter it using organic methods as a necessity for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

In Africa, on a rest and recoup trip to Kenya, he tried various exotic meats like crocodile (which tastes better than chicken), ostrich, and giraffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Perspective on [[Military life and experiences of Major Vivek Jacob | Military Life]]
Major Jacob stresses that being a soldier is "by heart, not by uniform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. He encourages aspiring defense personnel who could not join the forces not to lose heart, as they can still serve the nation as citizens with the right attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. He also emphasizes the importance of not wasting food, a lesson he imparts to his own children, contrasting it with the extreme hunger he witnessed in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

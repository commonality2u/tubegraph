The hosts and guests discuss various aspects of the occult and paranormal, sharing personal experiences and broader beliefs about entities and energies.

## Belief in Ghosts and Entities

The host believes in ghosts, stating that he feels there was a "strange ass energy" in his house, which he perceived as positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. He shares that his business head also experienced a feeling of "someone's looking at him but not trying to harm him" in the same room, a feeling the host himself experienced for a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. Janhvi Kapoor also believes it is "impossible when you're dead and gone that you don't leave like traces of your energy behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### The Nature of Ghostly Entities
According to the host's understanding from [[role_of_paranormal_investigators_and_varying_beliefs | psychics and paranormal investigators]], ghosts are not all bad, and are categorized into different types like poltergeists and pishach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. The nature of a ghost depends on the personality and circumstances of the person's death; for instance, if they died in anger, they might live as an angry, aggressive ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. The film *The Sixth Sense* is cited as an example of what psychics claim to be a real phenomenon where ghosts are constantly trying to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Personal Encounters with Paranormal Phenomena

The host recounts several [[personal_ghost_experiences | personal ghost experiences]]:

*   **Sleep Paralysis**: He describes a "very intense sleep paralysis" experience at age 11 while sleeping next to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. He felt a figure "sitting on top of me and staring me down with like one eye and half her head was covered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. His mother had previously told him to say a mantra if he felt something, which he did, and the experience faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Media Recreation**: Years later, at age 12 or 13, he saw an exact recreation of the figure from his sleep paralysis on a TV show about alien abduction on Nat Geo, which deeply frightened him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Office Encounter**: More recently, about four years prior, while meditating with his first teammate at night in their garage office, they both felt a "strong and intense" presence in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Psychic Confirmation**: He called a friend he believes is [[the_role_of_psychic_abilities_in_paranormal_work | psychic]], who, upon entering the space, immediately identified that "this entire part of the building used to be intensely haunted" and that the entity was "something from before the building was even built here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Activity**: Despite efforts to push out the negative energy, some junior teammates who stay at the office have reported seeing "a woman running around at night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, implying these are [[encounters_with_dark_entities | dark entities]] or spirits with "unfulfilled" pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## The Role of Meditation and Psychic Abilities

The host explains that deep meditations are believed to "push out all the pre-existent energies" from a space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. He and his teammate felt they had "meditated intensely enough to push it out" after their office encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. His psychic friend also provided "some particular kind of chants" to help clear the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>, similar to an exorcism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## Connecting Personal Energy to the Paranormal

The host identifies as an [[the_role_of_psychic_abilities_in_paranormal_work | empath]] and believes that empaths possess "healing energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. He suggests that "when you're going through that level of angst sometimes you attract things that need to be healed even in the other realm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. This perspective links personal emotional states to the attraction of certain energies or entities in the paranormal realm.

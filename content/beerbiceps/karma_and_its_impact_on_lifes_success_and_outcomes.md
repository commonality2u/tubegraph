Karma is described as the principle that nothing in this world is unfair; rather, everything is a direct consequence of actions, both visible and unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. What appears as "hard work" in the present life is considered "visible [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, the outcomes experienced in life, including success, are also influenced by good [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karmas]] performed by the soul in "another costume" (previous lifetimes) which are not visible in the current world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Karma and Life's Outcomes
Life's situations and personal experiences are seen as being "pre-decided" by one's own past [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. For example, some individuals may work extremely hard and still not achieve success, while others may exert minimal effort and find success comes easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This apparent unfairness is explained by the cumulative [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] a soul has accumulated across multiple lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. There is no such thing as luck; every outcome is predetermined by the [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] that the soul chooses to create, meaning [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] and destiny are inextricably linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## The Role of Sanskars
Sanskars (emotional patterns or nature) are inherent characteristics that a soul carries from past [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karmas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. These are not merely personality traits related to body language or speech, but deeper emotional patterns like criticism, appreciation, doubt, or trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. For instance, a baby born with a smiling disposition or a grumpy one carries these sanskars from previous "costumes" or lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Every soul is believed to possess all sanskars, and their manifestation in a particular lifetime is influenced by social conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

## Influence of Astrological Charts
Astrological charts are viewed as an "opening balance sheet" of the soul's accumulated [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] and sanskars from past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. They predict potential life events based on these inherited patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. However, these charts are merely "probability manuals," not absolute "reality manuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. The "influence of the planets on my sanskar" can change if one alters their sanskars through conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Therefore, predictions may not come true if the individual changes their way of "doing business" (creating [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]]) in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. Individuals are the creators of their own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

## Interplay with Free Will and Personal Growth
While past [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] influences present circumstances, individuals possess the free will to create new [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] and change their outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. Meditation and spiritual practices are key to this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

*   **Facing Consequences without Suffering:** Though the consequences of past [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karma]] will always manifest, a spiritual practice can alter one's response to these outcomes, preventing suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. For example, instead of reacting with anger to a difficult situation, one can respond with acceptance, thereby neutralizing the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Shifting Emotional Patterns:** Meditation helps cleanse and transform lower vibrational energies like stress, anger, and judgmental thinking, leading to a calmer and more stable mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. This shift in the quality of thoughts and emotional patterns (sanskars) is visible in day-to-day actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Stamina:** Progress in spiritual practice is measured by how one's feelings change in daily activity, not just during meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Spiritual stamina allows individuals to radiate good energy even when receiving negative energy from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. This helps settle past "uncomfortable karmic accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Karmic Accounts in Relationships
All close relationships—friends, family, romantic partners—are based on past "karmic accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. Souls have met before in different "costumes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. The nature of present relationships reflects the influence of these past interactions. If a past interaction was bitter, subsequent meetings will be influenced by that unresolved energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. Individuals will continue to meet those with whom they have strong karmic accounts until the account is sorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. The purpose is to settle these accounts and prevent further bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Spirituality aids in this by fostering the ability to create good [[karma_and_understanding_karmic_lessons | karmic accounts]] and cleanse existing uncomfortable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

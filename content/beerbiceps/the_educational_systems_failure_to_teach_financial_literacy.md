[[investment_advice_from_robert_kiyosaki | Robert Kiyosaki]] strongly criticizes the traditional educational system for its failure to teach individuals about money and finance. He asserts that this deficiency contributes significantly to widespread financial struggles and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

## A Systemic Problem
Kiyosaki highlights that the educational system does not teach anything about money, despite its critical importance in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. He recounts how, as a child, his own "poor dad," a highly educated PhD and school principal, perpetuated the common misconception that "the love of money is the root of all evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This, Kiyosaki points out, was simply a repetition of what his father had been taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

He challenges the conventional wisdom that staying in school guarantees wealth, stating, "if you stay in school you'll be rich... not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, and calls this a "lie told to our kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Critique of Educators and Curriculum
Kiyosaki refers to school teachers as "the biggest criminals in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> due to their teaching of false information about money. He explicitly states, "I really don't like school" and "I fight with them all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

He claims that many school teachers are "marxists" or "Communists" who lack a "money building mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He experienced this directly when 39 college professors "attacked" him for discussing capitalism with young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. He suggests that these educators believe "everybody should be equal" and "should all be share everything," which he dismisses as "lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

According to Kiyosaki, schools deliberately withhold knowledge about real money, preferring that people remain ignorant of the fact that modern currencies are "fake" or "toilet paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. He argues that the school system is "out of integrity" because it does not teach about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

## Consequences of Financial Illiteracy
The lack of financial education, coupled with working for "fake" money, contributes to poverty and homelessness. Kiyosaki observes that the slums seen in places like Mumbai are now spreading across America, with as many homeless people as Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He attributes this problem to people working for "fake stuff, toilet paper" because they are not informed by the school systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

He emphasizes that this broken system makes "the crooks richer but the poor poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Advocating for Financial Education
Kiyosaki dedicates his work to countering this educational deficiency, writing books to "go against those teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. His first book, "Rich Dad Poor Dad," advised readers not to go to school if they wanted to be rich, sparking significant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

He insists that people need to understand what money truly is, distinguishing between "fake money" (fiat currency like the dollar or rupee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> and "real money" (gold and silver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. His primary advice is to "stop working for this [fake money]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a> and instead "work for assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. He advocates for investing in silver as the "best investment in the world today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Ultimately, [[investment_advice_from_robert_kiyosaki | Robert Kiyosaki]] believes that the goal of life is personal choice and doing good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He teaches "prosperity, happiness, money, truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a> and emphasizes that one's financial dealings should always be legal, ethical, and moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

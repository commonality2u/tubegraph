Demonic possession is described as a sickness that is unwanted in the body, soul, or spirit, akin to a cold or flu on a different level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Historically, ancient people used the term "demon" for diseases like leprosy or convulsions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## The Role of an Exorcist

An exorcist is an individual who can aid in [[demonology_and_its_study | demonic possession]] cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Dr. Savio Fado identifies as an exorcist, a psychic, and a skeptic who questions everything, even during exorcisms or at haunted locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He brings a scientific approach, utilizing handwriting analysis, symbol reading (as a graphologist), NLP, hypnotherapy, face reading, and behavior analysis to his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that his intent is to help people understand darkness to move towards the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Exorcism goes parallel to mental health therapy, like that provided by a psychiatrist or psychologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Understanding Demonic Entities

Demons are present everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The speaker relates their presence to unseen bacteria or viruses, suggesting that just because one doesn't perceive them doesn't mean they aren't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Demonic Hierarchy

Satan is considered the devil and the leader of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. However, the speaker suggests not to place demons in a hierarchy, as they are "programmed" similar to angels who perform specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. For example, a demon causing pancreatic cancer wouldn't cause paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Some demons are more potent because they can manipulate a person's memory, conscience, and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Manifestations and Vulnerability

When possessed, individuals might manifest physically through abnormal strength, vomiting, or using offensive language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Other manifestations include self-harm, aggression, or a desire to commit suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. These individuals are often unaware of their actions during the "manic phase" but may realize the wrongness once calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

Less severe possessions can lead to misfortune, accidents, failed endeavors, or family discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

A person becomes vulnerable to [[understanding_demonic_entities_in_the_context_of_tantra | demonic attachment]] when there is a "gap" in their aura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Demons feed on negative emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. If these emotions are displayed, demons may target the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Fear is particularly detrimental as demons feed off it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## The Process of Exorcism

The first step in exorcism is diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. An exorcist must identify the specific demon afflicting the person, just as a doctor diagnoses a disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Each demon has its own weakness that must be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Exorcism involves intricate spiritual procedures, but it need not be as dramatic as portrayed in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. It requires understanding the person's history and symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. During a manic phase, an exorcist might wait for the person to calm down before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This process can take several hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

An exorcist might use religious texts, such as the Bible and its scriptures, to minister to the person's spirit and expel the demon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The objective is to emancipate the person's spirit and soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

## Challenging Cases of Possession

One of the most challenging cases encountered involved two boys, approximately 13-14 years old, who exhibited synchronized demonic possession symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Their manic phases, including self-harm and aggression towards others, occurred rhythmically and synchronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It was later discovered they were half-brothers, sharing the same father, who was involved in pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The demonic manifestations in the boys were connected to the father's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The possessions ceased only when the father committed suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This case was particularly baffling due to the need to address the underlying environmental factor rather than just the immediate possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Prevention and Protection

Maintaining a positive aura is key to preventing attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Meditating and praying in a room can cleanse it by filling it with a positive aura, which increases its density and drives off other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This creates a protected space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Exorcists or paranormal investigators perform spiritual hygiene at the location of an [[personal_ghost_experiences | encounter]] to prevent entities from following them home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Being in a constant meditative state helps maintain a dense aura, allowing them to instantly shun any entities attempting to attach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Objects and Portals

Objects that have been the source of disturbances from cases are sometimes collected and stored by exorcists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. These "charged objects" can be like "demonic pets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

Mirrors, especially those facing each other, can act as portals or entryways to other dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. While not all mirrors are portals, they potentially can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Mirror rooms in carnivals are potentially dangerous if one stares too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Natural portals can also exist where multiple elements (like water bodies or trees) interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. A house can become a portal if objects emitting high EMF (electromagnetic frequencies), such as an inverter battery, Wi-Fi router, or refrigerator, are placed in a triangular configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This can lead to multiple entities entering and exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Demons from Other Entities

A key distinction between a [[differences_between_spirits_and_demons | ghost]] and a demon is that a demon has "never walked Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Demons are described as "free radicals of energy" that latch onto spiritual memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. If the memory is positive, they form angels and spirit guides; if negative, they form demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Some entities can also be "gray" or confused, causing confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

Poltergeist activities, such as throwing objects or shattering glass, occur when entities manipulate mediums like air or vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Stronger entities can interact more with the physical realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Not all poltergeists were human; they could be a different kind of being from another realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Entities can manipulate a person's mind, killing their conscience and convincing them that evil actions are justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. However, whether a chant or external influence causes negative actions depends on the individual's inherent willingness to internalize and act upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## [[interactions_with_ghosts_and_entities | Interactions with Ghosts and Entities]]

Spirits can be telepathically communicated with as they don't have physical bodies, vision, or hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Telepathic communication involves projecting thoughts, using mediums like light, air, water, or fire to transmit vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

Often, ghosts don't know they are dead and perceive humans as other normal people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. They only interact when their presence is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, as they conserve energy. They gather energy from EMF, light, or even plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Some entities refuse to cross over because they have desires (e.g., concern for family, attachment to property, or desire for revenge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

Coexisting invisible entities are common, and they only become a "pest" when they disturb people, similar to rodents or insects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### Ouija Boards

Ouija boards are typically based on the ideomotor effect, where micro-muscles of the fingers unconsciously move the planchette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The information conveyed often comes from the participants' subconscious memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. However, the speaker cautions that while largely scientific, a Ouija board can potentially be a tool for inviting a demon or dead entity, similar to "playing blind dates with evil entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. An entity may seek to use this as a medium to communicate with the living world if an understanding is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Occult Objects and Practices

The speaker states that "anything you want it to be" can be an occult thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. An example is taking a log of wood: it serves a practical purpose as firewood or furniture, but if carved into a deity and worshipped, it becomes one. Similarly, chanting "Bloody Mary" with the intention of seeing her can make it happen, but if treated as a game, nothing will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The key is the intention and belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

Any form of [[experiences_and_beliefs_about_the_occult_and_paranormal | spirit communication]], whether through gadgets, or Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), is considered a response if it correlates to the stimulus provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

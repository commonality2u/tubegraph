The concept of "freebies" and the role of a welfare state in India are complex issues, often leading to polarized opinions in political discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. While proponents argue for their necessity in a developing country, critics highlight their detrimental long-term economic effects and political motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

## Defining Freebies

Freebies are defined as giveaways or subsidies provided by political parties, such as free electricity, free water, or free trips for senior citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.

## The Welfare State Argument

For a country like India, a government needs to operate as a welfare state to prevent widespread hardship and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government provided two meals a day to 800 million people, a welfare measure that has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. Other essential welfare provisions include free education and free health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>.

However, the funding for such a welfare state should ideally be generated through [[economic_policies_and_the_future_of_india | capitalism]], not socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. This means encouraging businesses and taxing them appropriately, similar to systems in countries like America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>.

## Criticisms of Government Involvement in Business

A major criticism of government policies in India is the state's involvement in running businesses. The speaker argues that a government "has no business to be in business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. This stance was explicitly stated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself in 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

The reasons for this criticism include:
*   **Lack of Accountability:** Inability to dismiss non-contributing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Competitiveness:** Government-run entities struggle to compete with private businesses, often relying on government funding to survive (e.g., Doordarshan vs. private channels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Corruption:** The system enables individuals to earn money without contributing or being profit-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:21]</a>.
*   **Outdated Operations:** Some public sector units (PSUs) continue to operate even when their purpose is obsolete, like a PSU funded to make chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) years after they were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Drain:** India has approximately 1,830 public sector units (central and state), with about 400 being non-functional but still receiving government money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. Even profitable PSUs are seen as underperforming compared to what they would achieve in private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Old Pension Scheme

The old pension scheme (OPS) is cited as a significant example of a policy driven by political expediency that has long-term negative economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.
*   Originally, the Congress government under Dr. Manmohan Singh, along with Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, introduced the new pension scheme (NPS) because the OPS was projected to bankrupt states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. The OPS unfairly burdened younger taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.
*   By 2018-2019, most states had transitioned to NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.
*   However, in Himachal Pradesh, the Congress party reverted to the OPS to appease a voter base of retired individuals, winning the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.
*   This decision was called the "biggest freebie" by Montek Singh Ahluwalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.
*   The repercussions include other states (like Chhattisgarh and Punjab) also considering or reverting to OPS, leading to potential financial disasters where 80% of state revenue could go towards propping up the pension scheme instead of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Farm Bills

The three farm bills introduced by the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] aimed to be significant [[economic_reforms_in_india | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>:
1.  **Farmer Choice:** Allowed farmers to sell produce anywhere, not just government-controlled *mandis* (APMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Storage Freedom:** Eliminated the Essential Commodities Act that prevented farmers from storing produce, enabling them to store it for longer periods and sell when prices were favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Contract Farming:** Allowed business organizations to contract farmers to grow specific crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.

These reforms were projected to catapult India into a middle-income economy with a per capita GDP of $15,000 within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>. Ironically, these very reforms were in the manifestos of opposition parties, including the Congress, which had even started contract farming in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. However, when the Modi government introduced them, the opposition called them "black laws," leading to protests that lasted over a year, causing immense economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>. The repeal of these laws by the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] is seen as an "anti-national decision" because it prevented potential prosperity without clear reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>.

## Political Motivation and Strategy

Politicians often prioritize winning elections over implementing policies that benefit the country in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. Offering freebies is a common strategy to secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. For example, the BJP has given more freebies than many other parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

The speaker highlights the political calculation: if a government were to shut down loss-making public sector units, the employees and their families would not vote for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. This reflects [[the_impact_of_leadership_and_politics_on_economy | political expediency]] and the desire to placate voter bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

There is also a perception that while some politicians apologize for their failures, they may not be genuinely remorseful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. However, it is suggested that an honest politician admitting to shortcomings and vulnerabilities could significantly benefit their public relations and voter trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.

### Polarized Opinions

The discourse around government policies, including freebies, is often highly polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Opposition parties tend to highlight government mistakes, while ruling parties focus on achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. For instance, the speaker notes that the opposition has not commended the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] on initiatives like Fit India or Swachh Bharat (which built more toilets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Similarly, the BJP in opposition did not often commend the UPA government's achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This leads to a "black or white" view, making it difficult for the public to find common ground or acknowledge nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

## Impact on National Development

The missed opportunities due to political expediency and [[corruption_in_indian_politics | corruption]] are a major source of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Policies driven by political gain, rather than national interest, hinder India's progress. India is seen as having the potential to "leapfrog" development through technology and decisive policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>. For example, the widespread adoption of mobile phones in India was a "leapfrog" driven by technology, bypassing the need for extensive landline infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>. However, other non-technology-driven but decision-driven projects, like river linking, remain stagnant despite their potential to address massive droughts and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>.

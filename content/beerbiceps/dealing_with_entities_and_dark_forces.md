The ability to perceive beyond the physical realm, often associated with the activation of the [[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | third eye]], can open an individual to a wide spectrum of spiritual beings and forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. This expanded perception includes both benevolent and malevolent [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

## Perceiving the Unseen
The activation of the third eye is described as powerful, enabling sight beyond physical vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. This "eye" is scientifically and biologically considered the seat for all sensesâ€”eyes, ears, and the emotional self, or seat of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. It connects to the pituitary gland and the pineal gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. The ability to see (clairvoyance) or hear (clairaudience) information forms part of psychic abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

The speaker, a psychic and healer, had her third eye opened at age nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This opening meant she could see more people and [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>, even with her eyes shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. This included experiencing [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | psychic attacks]] and [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | tantric attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.

## Types of Entities and Their Influence
The spiritual realm encompasses various [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | entities]]:
*   **Spirits, Ghosts, and [[yakinis_and_paranormal_entities | Demonic Entities]]**: These are often low vibrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. They are present in the same physical space as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:20">[01:47:20]</a>. While some may appear scary, they typically do not harm unless provoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. They seek "light" and a release from pain and difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. The speaker, a powerful psychic, has only seen a few truly "scary ghosts" in over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>. One experience involved a female entity with blue-gray eyes and open hair, resembling Samara from *The Ring*, sitting on a closed toilet in her London house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.
*   **Walk-ins**: These are positive [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | entities]] that temporarily inhabit a human body when the authentic soul is absent (e.g., during astral travel) and leave when the soul returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. They can download powerful information, such as messages from higher masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Possessions**: Unlike walk-ins, [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | entities]] in a possession continue to stay in the body even after the soul returns, draining the individual's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Tantrics and Villainous Occultists**: These are powerful [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | beings]] who use spiritual knowledge for negative purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:36">[01:51:36]</a>. They may try to capture souls or use their power for their own material growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:47">[01:49:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>. This concept aligns with the "deal with the Devil" or Illuminati narratives, where individuals trade a part of themselves (health, relationships) for fame or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. Such deals are irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:53">[01:58:53]</a>.

## Protection and Energetic Management
To deal with [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | negative entities]] and [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | dark forces]], protective measures are essential:
*   **Energy Protection**: Techniques include placing energy scanners at doors, protecting rooms, invoking Divine Light, cutting energetic cords, and ensuring the authentic spirit is within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.
*   **Non-Harmful Approach**: When encountering malevolent [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | tantrics]], the approach is not to destroy them but to reduce their power, for example, by placing them in an "energetic bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>. This process can be energetically draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:45">[01:56:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>.
*   **Setting Boundaries**: Individuals with healing gifts should set boundaries to ensure they attract "whole and complete souls" in their personal lives, channeling the healing energy primarily through professional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
*   **Karma and Choices**: While individuals might encounter suffering, it does not necessarily mean they are dealing with [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | black magic]] or external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. Many challenges are related to [[karma]], which can only be balanced or released, not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:42">[02:29:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>. Low vibrational souls, such as murderers or those who commit suicide, are stuck in the astral realm and must be sent back to learn lessons, indicating a lack of choice in their reincarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:46">[02:23:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:48">[02:23:48]</a>. However, even these souls can evolve through subsequent lifetimes to balance negative [[karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:43">[02:28:43]</a>.
*   **Spirit Guides**: Deceased family members, also referred to as [[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | spirit guides]], can choose to remain in the spiritual realm to guide and protect their living relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. They can be present with multiple family members simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. They may communicate through dreams or by influencing others to deliver messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

In essence, while the expansion of perception can reveal [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | frightening entities]], understanding their nature, implementing energetic protection, and managing personal [[karma]] allows individuals to navigate these experiences safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

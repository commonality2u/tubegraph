## Early Struggles and Motivation
Tanmay Bhat's journey with weight loss began when the host, who would become his first mentor in the media industry, helped him with his [[weight_loss_without_exercise | weight loss journeys]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This training was a reciprocal arrangement, with Tanmay mentoring the host in media in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Tanmay recalls being a "fat kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> and seeking to own other qualities when he felt he "didn't have looks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This led him to focus on academics, extracurriculars, and eventually a career in media, constantly seeking validation and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. He views the "need to hustle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> not as entirely positive, but as an attempt to fill a void by sacrificing everything for a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Training and Diet Approach
The host remembers training Tanmay at his house at 9 AM, often finding him "regretting [his] whole life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, and even jumping on him to wake him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Despite initial struggles, Tanmay "had got into some sexy ass shape back in the day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Tanmay learned to be self-sufficient in his [[exercise_diet_and_lifestyle_advice_for_weight_loss_and_general_health | fitness journey]] after this period, understanding that fitness is not rocket science and can be achieved with discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. He considered this experience akin to getting a "diploma in Fitness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> and views it as a life skill everyone should possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

He noted that previously his diet mindset involved "binge cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>, meaning if he was off keto or a diet, he would eat excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. Now, his mindset has changed; even when "cheating," he still cuts out sugar and aims for normal, healthier meals like *Dal chawal* or *Roti sabzi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. He prioritizes "small changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a> and a long-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

### Current Fitness Habits
Tanmay has set a goal to have a jawline in the next year, aiming to drop 8 kilos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. His current approach to [[exercise_diet_and_lifestyle_advice_for_weight_loss_and_general_health | physical fitness]] involves daily walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a> and playing badminton two to three times a week for cardio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. He prefers a slower, steady pace, losing about 4 kilos a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>, rather than burning out by doing too much too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. He's also vlogging about his journey for public accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Health Complications
Tanmay experienced a life-threatening health crisis due to his weight. He weighed 245 kilos, his heaviest ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He suffered from acute sleep apnea, where his body weight in certain sleeping positions would prevent enough oxygen from reaching his brain, causing seizures and waking him up to four times a night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

During a medical check-up, his neck muscles collapsed, and he stopped breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. Doctors had to resuscitate him, and his body went into involuntary thrusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. He was in the ICU for six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. This incident occurred shortly after the AIB roast, during which he had been sedentary, eating ten ice creams a day, and "eating [his] anxiety away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He ate "nonstop," with every meal being a "buffet meal," and no distinct breakfast, lunch, or dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. The need for constant oral stimulation, like smoking, also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

## Mental and Emotional Aspects
Tanmay emphasizes that [[exercise_diet_and_lifestyle_advice_for_weight_loss_and_general_health | losing weight]] is not just a physical exercise, but also a "painful mental exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>. He realized that much of his unhealthy eating stemmed from his mind being bored or undisciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

He acknowledges that his body might "want to be fat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a> because "deep down I don't think I deserve happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. This feeling, he believes, is rooted in the trauma of being bullied as a child, leading to a suppressed belief that he doesn't deserve happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. He advises overweight children who are bullied to "sit down and cry it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>, as men often lack the skills to emotionally vent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

His weight loss journey significantly impacted his thought process, leading to increased confidence and a belief in his own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. He highlights that [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | emotional processing]] is crucial for mastering one's brain and achieving long-term weight management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

This [[tanmay_bhats_reinvention_and_mental_health | personal reinvention]] has led him to a happier and more self-aware state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. He has learned to embrace patience and play "long-term games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a> in life, rather than expecting immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

Tanmay Bhat's journey with weight loss has been a significant aspect of his life, deeply intertwined with his career and personal growth. His initial engagement with fitness began when he sought the help of Ranveer Allahbadia (BeerBiceps) as a personal coaching client for weight loss, back when YouTube revenue was minimal and Ranveer funded his startup by helping people with their weight loss journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This mutual training relationship involved Ranveer coaching Tanmay on physical fitness, while Tanmay mentored Ranveer in the media industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Early Life and Motivation
Tanmay grew up as a "fat kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, which instilled in him a constant need to prove his worth beyond appearance. He describes a progression: from focusing on academics because he felt he "didn't have looks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, to excelling in extracurriculars, and then entering media and comedy to seek attention and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. He views his "hustle" not as inherently good, but as an attempt to fill a void by sacrificing everything else for his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This drive also stemmed from his "daddy issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, which he identifies as a strong motivation to succeed in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Health Crisis and Transformation
At his heaviest, Tanmay weighed 245 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, suffering from acute sleep apnea where insufficient oxygen reached his brain during sleep, causing seizures that would wake him up four times a night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. This condition led to a near-death experience where his neck muscles collapsed, causing him to stop breathing, and he had to be resuscitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. He spent six days in the ICU, with pipes in his nose, and the memory of his mother's smile upon waking up remains vivid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. This incident occurred just two days after the AIB Roast, a period where he was eating around 10 ice creams a day, consuming his feelings and anxiety away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. This health scare was a turning point, prompting him to get his life in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

## [[Dietbased weight loss strategies | Diet and Fitness Approach]]
His past eating habits included non-stop consumption, primarily from restaurants, where every meal was a "buffet meal" with no distinction between breakfast, lunch, or dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. He ate until he felt like sleeping and often ate out of boredom or stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

Under Ranveer's guidance, Tanmay experienced a period where he learned that "fitness is not rocket science" and primarily requires discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. This training provided him with a "diploma in Fitness" and basic health knowledge, which he considers a life skill everyone should have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

Currently, Tanmay is prioritizing a long-term, steady approach to weight loss rather than intense sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. He focuses on [[Impact of cutting sugar and junk food on weight loss | diet]] and walking every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, aiming to lose about 4 kilograms a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. He also plays badminton two to three times a week, which he finds to be an enjoyable form of cardio where you don't realize you're working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. He emphasizes consistency, choosing not to burn out early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. A significant mindset shift for him is that even when "cheating" on his diet, he now avoids sugar and consumes regular meals like dal, chawal, roti, and sabzi instead of binge-eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. He views weight loss as both a physical and a mental exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

## Mental and Emotional Aspects
Tanmay's weight loss journey is deeply connected to his mental state and self-perception:
*   **Self-worth and Insecurity:** He admits that his self-worth was once tied to productivity and external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He struggled with insecurity, believing himself to be an "idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, which he attributes to childhood bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.
*   **Impact of Bullying:** He recalls traumatic childhood experiences of being body-shamed and bullied by slum kids who would pull his pants down to inspect him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. He advises other overweight kids to process this trauma, as many adults haven't forgiven themselves for such experiences, leading to a belief that they don't deserve happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Thought Process Change:** Losing weight significantly changed his thought process, leading to increased confidence and a belief in his capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Therapy and Self-Awareness:** He underwent intense therapy, which helped him realize his dependence on external validation and the need to overcome it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. He sees therapy as a "gym for your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>, offering a detached space for self-reflection that friends cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.
*   **Meditation and Patience:** He has embraced meditation (using Headspace) to create "no stimulation time" and observe his thoughts, recognizing the importance of just sitting quietly in a generation that has forgotten how to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. This has helped him develop patience and the realization that life is long, encouraging him to play long-term games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

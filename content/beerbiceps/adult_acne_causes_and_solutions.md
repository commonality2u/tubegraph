Dermatology, unfortunately, is a field that has become somewhat trivialized and diluted, with many individuals claiming expertise without proper qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A truly great dermatologist is a legitimate, board-certified specialist who prioritizes accurate diagnosis and aims to empower patients to manage their skin independently, rather than fostering dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Adult acne is a widespread concern, especially in metropolitan areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In fact, Singapore once declared acne a pandemic due to its prevalence and antibiotic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

## Causes of Adult Acne

Adult acne is a complex condition with multiple contributing factors:

*   **Dietary Habits**
    *   [[Importance of Diet and Lifestyle for Skin Health | Excessive protein supplements]], particularly without adequate carbohydrates, can lead to inflammation in the body, manifesting as acne on the face and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Extreme dieting practices such as zero-fat, zero-carb, keto, or intermittent fasting can disrupt natural hormone cycles, leading to acne outbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   Dairy and dairy products are often inflammatory, with the exception of curd (yogurt), buttermilk, and ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
    *   Processed foods, including cheese and packaged protein powders, should be avoided due to hidden inflammatory ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
    *   All forms of sugar, including artificial sweeteners and even "fruit sugar" in packaged foods, cause insulin spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. Chronic insulin surges can lead to insulin resistance, which promotes inflammation and hormonal disruptions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Factors**
    *   [[Role of Stress in Skin Problems | Stress]], including the "stress of looking good," is a significant contributor to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. When stress levels are high, the body releases hormones that can lead to breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
    *   Lack of sleep can also trigger acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
    *   Alcohol consumption and smoking are known aggressors that can worsen skin conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Poor scalp hygiene, such as not washing the scalp well, can contribute to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Imbalances**
    *   Acne in males and females differs due to varying sebaceous (oil) gland sizes and densities, which are highly influenced by hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
    *   Testosterone is a primary hormone that stimulates oil gland activity, leading to increased oil production and larger pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
    *   In women, hormonal acne can be linked to conditions like PCOS, adrenal excess of male hormones (androgens), or elevated prolactin levels, which can cause red, angry acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
    *   Blood tests for hormonal imbalances are typically ordered only after a detailed clinical examination reveals specific signs and symptoms, rather than as a random first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Environmental Factors**
    *   Pollution, while not the sole cause, can contribute to skin issues like eczema and allergies, and it also plays a role in skin inflammation, which can aggravate acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Genetics**
    *   Genetics can predispose individuals to certain skin types, such as larger oil glands, making them more prone to acne regardless of lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Microbiome Imbalance**
    *   The gut-skin axis highlights the connection between gut health and skin conditions like acne and eczema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. An inflamed gut can manifest on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   Disruption of the skin microbiome (the balance of microorganisms on the skin) can also lead to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

## Solutions for Adult Acne

### Lifestyle and Diet Adjustments
Addressing the root cause is paramount. Simple lifestyle changes like sleeping well and maintaining scalp hygiene can significantly reduce acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Keeping a food or activity diary can help identify personal triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

*   **Personalized Diet:** Everyone's body is different, and foods that suit one person may not suit another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It is crucial to identify which foods work for your body and which cause discomfort, bloating, or acne flare-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   [[Importance of Diet and Lifestyle for Skin Health | Whole Foods]]: Prioritize eating whole, unprocessed foods.
*   **Mindful Eating:** Be aware of how your body reacts to different foods; if a diet causes disruption (acne, hairfall, eczema flare-ups, period disruption in women), it's not the right diet for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Gut Health:** Incorporate traditional, fermented foods like curd or rice ganji (over-boiled, de-starched, often fermented rice) which serve as natural probiotics to heal and soothe the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.
*   [[Role of Stress in Skin Problems | Stress Management]]: Practices like yoga can balance hormones, calm the mind, and improve circulation and lymphatic drainage, leading to healthier, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.

### Medical Treatments

Medical treatments for acne often involve a multi-specialty approach, sometimes in conjunction with gynecologists or endocrinologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

*   **Antibiotics**: While traditionally used, long-term antibiotic use is discouraged due to its detrimental effect on gut flora and potential for resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Short-term, targeted courses (7-10 days) may be prescribed for severe infection and inflammation, often alongside good gut bacteria supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   [[Science Behind Acne Treatments | Accutane/Isotretinoin]]:
    *   This is an oral form of retinoid (a vitamin A derivative) that effectively dries out all glands in the body, including oil glands, tear glands, and vaginal glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.
    *   It is highly effective for almost everyone with acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.
    *   **Precautions:** It is teratogenic (can cause harm to a baby) in women, so it should not be used when trying to conceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. Potential side effects include dry skin, dry lips, hair loss, and in rare cases, liver toxicity or deranged lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>.
    *   Low-dose, long-term use (e.g., 5mg daily) has been explored for anti-aging benefits and can help maintain results, but should only be done under strict medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.
*   [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | Micro-needling Radiofrequency]]: This procedure involves tiny needles that deliver radiofrequency energy at specific depths to shrink oil glands permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. As a side effect, it also helps reduce scars by increasing collagen production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>. The cost can vary widely depending on the clinic, city, doctor's expertise, and machine quality, with typical costs ranging from ₹20,000-₹25,000 per session, requiring multiple sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.
*   **Chemical Peels**: Peels use various acids to gently loosen and remove the top dead layer of skin, improving complexion, fading scars, and evening skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">[01:47:55]</a>.
    *   **Types:** They range from very superficial (no downtime, immediate glow) to superficial (slight redness/irritation), medium depth (rough, shedding skin), and deep peels (significant downtime, not suitable for brown skin due to high pigmentation risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:13">[01:48:13]</a>.
    *   **Acne-specific peels:** Salicylic and mandelic acid peels are commonly used for acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>.
*   **Steroid Abuse Acne**: Long-term, improper use of topical steroids (creams like Ovalo, Desal, Elal) can cause "sterile acne" or acneiform eruptions, which are difficult to treat because they are not typical infections but rather steroid-induced reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.
*   **Intralesional Steroids**: For immediate relief of a single, inflamed pimple, a qualified dermatologist may inject a tiny amount of steroid directly into the lesion to suppress inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This should only be done by an expert to avoid side effects like skin atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

## General Skincare Principles for Acne-Prone Skin

A comprehensive skincare routine should follow three core principles: **cleanse, protect, and nourish** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.

*   **Cleansing:**
    *   Choosing the correct cleanser is crucial; a brightening face wash with acids can irritate and dry out dry skin, leading to pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.
    *   For oily, acne-prone skin, avoid over-drying cleansers as the body may overproduce oil in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.
    *   If exposed to pollution or heavy makeup, consider a pre-cleanse (oil-based or micellar water) to remove dust and makeup before washing with a regular cleanser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.
*   **Protection:**
    *   [[Moisturizers and Their Effects on Acne and Bacteria | Sunscreen]] is essential for everyone, protecting against UV rays, visible light, and infrared rays that cause inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. Sunscreen formulations are advanced and offer broad protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. While sun is good for Vitamin D in early morning or late evening, modern environmental factors and skin-abusing products make consistent sunscreen use necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.
    *   Moisturizers also offer protection against dust and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Nourishment:**
    *   Nourishment means providing what your skin needs to quench and calm itself, which can include good ingredients like licorice, calendula, or certain mists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
    *   **Exfoliation**: Exfoliate gently once a week to remove dead skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which damages the skin barrier and microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. Opt for gentle physical exfoliants (like fine rice or sugar powders) or chemical exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs like lactic or salicylic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
    *   **Makeup**: Makeup itself does not inherently harm skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. The primary issues arise from unclean applicators (sponges, brushes) which can transfer bacteria and irritate skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. Disposable sponges and regular cleaning of makeup products and brushes are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. Always remove makeup thoroughly and use good quality, non-heavy products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
    *   [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | Retinol]]: This is a potent vitamin A derivative, an older but well-researched anti-aging ingredient that increases cell turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. It works best for thicker, acne-prone, oily skin types and can help with acne by reducing oil glands and clogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:46">[01:35:46]</a>. However, it's not for everyone, especially those with thin, dry, or sensitive skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a>. Strict sun protection is vital when using retinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>.
    *   [[Moisturizers and Their Effects on Acne and Bacteria | Hyaluronic Acid]]: This ingredient provides hydration to the skin, but it is an acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>. It's ideal for normal, oily, or calm skin that needs hydration. For dry, sensitive, or irritated skin, it can cause further irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

## Seeking Professional Help

Skin, hair, and nails serve as diagnostic tools, reflecting internal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Consulting a qualified dermatologist is vital, as self-treating or relying on non-experts can lead to worsening conditions or serious complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Medical treatments are an investment, and choosing based on low cost rather than expertise can lead to ineffective or even damaging results, especially in cosmetic procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding your body, addressing root causes, and seeking informed medical advice when needed are key to managing adult acne and maintaining overall skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>. While acne can be a source of psychological distress, it's a solvable problem, and a doctor's role extends beyond saving lives to enhancing the quality of life through improved confidence and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:16">[02:07:16]</a>.

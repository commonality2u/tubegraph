## Introduction to Nagas

In [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Indian mythology]], Nagas are commonly understood as snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. However, ancient texts describe them as a distinct species, neither entirely snake nor fully human, but rather humanoids with the ability to shapeshift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. They are believed to reside in subterranean realms, often referred to as Patala Loka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Carvings at sites like Mahabalipuram depict Nagas transforming from snake-like forms to human-like figures emerging from underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

## Global Presence and Comparative Mythology

The speaker observes that Nagas, or similar serpent-like entities, are found in various ancient civilizations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>, suggesting a common, shared narrative across cultures. This aligns with themes in [[comparative_mythology_between_indian_texts_and_other_ancient_cultures | comparative mythology]].

Examples include:
*   **Peru:** Figures known as *amaru*, which is similar to the Sanskrit word *amar* meaning "immortal God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.
*   **Colombia:** In locations like San Agust√≠n, a lingam is depicted as being guarded by a Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
*   **Mayan Civilization:** Naga-like figures are also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Israel:** Nagas are referred to as *nakash*, a term similar to the Indian *sarpa*, with both meaning "serpent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

### The "Oldest God" Theory

The speaker proposes that Nagas could be considered the "oldest gods" or significant figures across various ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. This theory is based on their ubiquitous presence in ancient structures and [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | temples]]:
*   While other deities like Kartikeya or Ganesha might not appear in every temple, Nagas are consistently carved into ancient structures and temples by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>.
*   This widespread depiction suggests their enduring presence and potential seniority within these ancient belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

## Nagas as Civilizers and Rulers

A recurring theme in various ancient civilizations' narratives, including those of India and Cambodia, is that the first rulers or ancestors were Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.
*   In Cambodia, the very first ruler, Soma (a Hindu name), is said to have descended from the Nagas and married a human, Kaundinya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   Evidence of Nagas founding empires is seen in places like Angkor Bore, Cambodia, where ruins dating back 2,000 to possibly 4,000 years show extensive carvings of Nagas, suggesting their foundational role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
*   Local accounts from remote areas in India suggest that short beings from the sky, perceived as deities, civilized early humans by teaching them construction technology and fire-making before vanishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. These "alien species" are linked to the Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## Speculative Theories and Paranormal Connections

The speaker explores speculative theories regarding Nagas and their origins, linking them to concepts often discussed in [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | paranormal theories and entities in Indian culture]]:

*   **Dinosaur Evolution:** A "fanfiction theory" suggests that some dinosaurs may have survived the extinction event and evolved into Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. This is supported by carvings of what appear to be dinosaurs, like a Stegosaurus in the Hindu temple of Ta Prohm in Cambodia, which dates back 1,000 to 2,000 years, long after dinosaurs are believed to have become extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. Similar carvings of extinct species, such as a four-tusked elephant (ancestor of the mammoth), are also found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Reptilian Species/Aliens:** In modern terms, Nagas are likened to "reptilians" or alien species capable of shapeshifting and living in different dimensions, such as underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. This aligns with radical thought processes about [[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | reptilian control over humans]], as put forth by figures like David Icke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.
    *   [!NOTE] The speaker clarifies that he is merely "entertaining" such radical theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

This perspective challenges conventional [[indian_mythology_versus_history | historical narratives]] by suggesting that ancient civilizations possessed knowledge of beings and technologies beyond what is currently accepted by mainstream archaeology and history books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>.

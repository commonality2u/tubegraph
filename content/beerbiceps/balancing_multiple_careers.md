Gorov Taneja, known as Flying Beast on YouTube, exemplifies a successful individual [[Balancing multiple careers | balancing multiple careers]] through sheer passion and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He manages two YouTube channels, Flying Beast (vlogging) and Fit Muscle TV (fitness), while also working as a pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Fuelled by Passion

Taneja attributes his ability to manage multiple demanding roles to his deep passion for all his endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He describes his work as something he loves so much that "everything revolves around" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He likens it to children's love for playing cricket, where they are driven by enjoyment rather than obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This passion is evident in his videos, where viewers can "see the love" he puts into his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Career Transitions and [[Pursuing passion despite challenges | Pursuing Passion]]

Taneja's career path demonstrates a willingness to pivot and pursue his true interests:

*   **From IIT to Pilot:** Despite the difficulty of gaining admission to IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, Taneja chose not to pursue a career directly from his engineering degree. His initial aspiration after 12th grade was to become a pilot, but financial constraints prevented it at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While studying for engineering exams, he found a passion for physics and math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Eventually, his "old passion somewhere revived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, leading him to become a pilot. He convinced his father, who initially wanted him to pursue a Master's in the US, to [[Career choices and parental support | trust his feeling]] and allow him to pursue flying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This decision has led to immense satisfaction, as he states he is "very happy" and doesn't "feel like [he's] working" when he goes to his pilot job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

*   **From Pilot/Fitness to YouTuber:** Taneja's journey into YouTube began with his fitness background and competing in fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He initially shared fitness advice on Facebook, realizing there was a demand for professional guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A friend suggested YouTube was a better platform for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. He casually uploaded videos until he noticed he had accumulated 600 subscribers, prompting him to focus on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Launching a Second Channel:** The creation of his vlogging channel, Flying Beast, was a strategic move. While documenting a fitness transformation on his existing channel, he realized the content might become repetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. To avoid being stuck in just the fitness category and reach a different audience, he decided to "bring in a different content element of vlogging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This was a risk, especially with his wife's concerns about his already busy schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, he trusted it was a "better move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, and it proved successful within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Advice for [[Overcoming challenges in early career | Aspiring Professionals]]

Taneja offers several pieces of advice for young people, particularly those in engineering college who might be dissatisfied with their current path:

*   **Take Action and Trust Your Gut:** If you are "very sure about your idea," take the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Don't be influenced by others; if you truly feel you can do something, "just go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Planning is not enough; "unless you take your step, put your foot down and take some action," it will not be fruitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Discover Your Hidden Talent:** Everyone possesses a unique talent, and if your "heart is in that thing, it'll become good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Self-Care:** Despite a busy life, it's crucial to "take some time out" for personal fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The hardest part is getting out of your comfort zone, but once you start, like going to the gym, it becomes easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Connect with Family:** In an increasingly online world, it's important to "give some time to your family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[work_life_balance_and_self_care | balancing personal life]] amidst a busy professional life.

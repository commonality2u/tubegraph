The speaker shares [[personal_ghost_stories | personal ghost stories]] and [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings]] from their life, particularly focusing on encounters with sleep paralysis and perceived supernatural entities. These experiences led to a deep-seated fear of the dark and a later embrace of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Childhood Fears and Early Encounters
From a young age, the speaker questioned if there was "some deeper layer that we can't see" beyond human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Horror movies further solidified this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The house where the speaker grew up had a family-owned hospital on the ground floor, and the speaker lived on the third floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A persistent fear of the dark plagued the speaker, who felt "someone staring" in corridors and experienced a sense of presence in dark rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This phase of fear was longer than typical, making it impossible for the speaker to sleep alone until around 19 or 20 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Nature of Sleep Paralysis
At age 11, the speaker began experiencing frequent sleep paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Sleep paralysis is described as a scientific phenomenon where an individual half-wakes up, unable to move or scream, while their vision remains conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> "When you're sleeping your brain signals to your muscular system not to move at all. It's a way for the body to protect itself, basically means your body becomes paralyzed because of your mind, so that if something's happening in your dreams you don't move your body in reaction to that dream. It's your body's protection mechanism." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

In severe cases of sleep paralysis, nightmares can blend into the experience as the brain confuses dreams and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The speaker's sleep paralysis often involved waking up to see a shadowy figure in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The only defense mechanism was to close one's eyes and hope to fall back asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## The Scariest Sleep Paralysis Experience
During one particularly terrifying episode at age 11, while sleeping next to their mother, the speaker felt "little shadowy creatures" chaining them down to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. These creatures seemed to welcome a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The speaker then saw a woman sitting on top of them, described as having:
*   Pale, achy, torn skin with blisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   Untidy hair covering one eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   A single pale red eye staring down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   A heavy weight on the chest and fingers on the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

Unable to move or scream, the speaker, who grew up in a spiritual family, remembered a mantra shared by their mother to ward off bad spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Closing their eyes, the speaker repeated "Om Namah Shivaya" until falling asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Upon waking, the entity was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Cultural Connections and Confirmations
Two years later, at age 13, the speaker watched a National Geographic show about alien abductions that depicted a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | cultural phenomenon]] involved sleep paralysis accompanied by a witch sitting on top of the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The show theorized that aliens might simulate such experiences for experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The visual representation of the woman in the show was "exactly what I saw" â€“ the same single eye, hair, burnt skin, and pale, dead eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This terrifying realization led to an emotional outburst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, and the speaker continued to struggle with sleeping alone for another 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear Through Spirituality
Eventually, the speaker's phobia diminished with the discovery of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Spirituality, beyond meditation and karma, addresses the spirit world, astral world, dark energies, and demons, offering ways to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. A key principle learned was from "Autobiography of a Yogi": "when you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This approach involved strengthening a "spiritual muscle" through meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Around age 22 or 23, the speaker frequently meditated with co-founder Rajas in a garage within their building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. During one night meditation session, both felt a "dark energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Applying the mantra (Om Namah Shivaya) again, they felt they pushed out a negative energy from the room and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Psychic Confirmation and Historical Accounts
Later, a psychic friend visited the speaker's office, located in the same building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Without prior knowledge, the psychic immediately went to a specific room at the end of the corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This room was directly below the speaker's childhood bedroom where the "witch incident" had occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The psychic stated, "This room has a lot of dark energy... has had some kind of a [[demonic_possession_and_exorcism | demon]] or a [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | ghost]] within it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, suggesting that the meditations had likely pushed it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Seeking further validation, the speaker consulted their grandfather, the building owner, who had run the hospital since the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The grandfather confirmed that over 50 years, patients in those exact rooms had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Some even reported being pushed off their hospital beds by a flash of a "really scary looking woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Resolution and Continued Belief
The hospital is now defunct, and the negative presence is no longer felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Following the psychic's examination, pujas, havens, and candle-lighting rituals were performed to make the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that their intense fear of the dark was not just a lack of light but a fear of an entity constantly staring at them from childhood into teenage years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This profound experience is a primary reason for embracing spirituality so strongly, as spiritual practices helped to face and push out these dark energies through positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Having had many [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | occult experiences]], the speaker believes that spiritual practices effectively combat the [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

When it comes to men's clothing, women often find shirts to be the sexiest item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While many men make mistakes when wearing shirts, building a perfect wardrobe doesn't require a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Essential Trio

Every man needs three basic shirt colors in his wardrobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:

*   **White** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Black** - described as versatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Light Blue** - considered super versatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

## Versatility of Basic Shirts

These three colors are highly versatile, serving multiple purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
*   They can be tucked in or left out for a casual look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   They pair well with jeans, chinos, or shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   They function as both formal and casual shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Quality and Investment

When purchasing shirts, especially for [[fashion_tips_for_indian_men | men from India]], it's crucial to invest in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:
*   Buy shirts priced at a minimum of 1500 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Shirts below this price often lack quality and may degrade after only three or four washes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Opt for slightly more expensive shirts that are designed to last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

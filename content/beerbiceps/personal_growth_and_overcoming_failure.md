Actor R. Madhavan and the podcast host discuss the profound impact of [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | personal growth and self-discovery]] and the critical role of [[learning_from_failures | overcoming failure]] in shaping one's life.

## The Journey of Personal Growth

R. Madhavan believes in continuous [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | personal growth]], stating that he is "still growing" with a "childlike enthusiasm and inquisitiveness" in his career and life [04:15]. He finds excitement in learning new things, even if he can't fully apply them [04:26].

### Embracing Resistance and Challenges
Madhavan intentionally seeks out paths of "most resistance" because he is "not ready to retire" [09:19]. Conquering large problems makes smaller ones seem irrelevant [09:28]. He compares this to a doctor tapping a patient before an injection to distract from the smaller prick [09:36]. This approach allows him to "do this all the time to every part of my mind" so that "small pricks are irrelevant" [09:42].

### Childhood and the Role of Stress
Madhavan describes his childhood as "most blessed" despite its challenges and "trauma" [09:48]. He considers childhood stress "very very important" [09:57]. His early "traumas" included not having a bicycle like his friends or waiting for his mother to feed him after school [10:02]. He was also judged and called "shaitan" (devil) for not being good at studies and for unconventional behaviors like petting street dogs [10:31].

He asserts that stress "is going to be there like it or lump it and you have to you really have to hug it" [11:02]. He cautions against avoiding stress, as it often leads to bigger problems [11:15]. He agrees with Rohit Shetty's observation that young people often confuse the feeling of stress with hard work [11:20]. To achieve something significant, one must break out of their [[utilizing_criticism_and_challenges_for_selfimprovement | comfort zone]], which Madhavan considers a "killer" and something to be "removed from everybody's life till you're in a point where you want to retire from life" [11:41]. He believes creativity and survival instincts are not generated in a comfort zone [11:57].

### Humility and Middle-Class Values
Madhavan credits the middle-class attitude and humility, particularly observed in Tamil and Malayali cultures, for fostering success [20:11]. This attitude discourages dwelling on small achievements, keeping individuals grounded and focused on continued progress [20:39]. He notes that many successful, influential Indians born in the 70s and 80s exemplify this approach [22:34].

The "middle-class attitude" is seen as the "best attitude for survival" [21:20], promoting the understanding that everything is transient and maintaining "situational awareness" to tackle changes [21:28].

### Daily Practices for Growth
Madhavan has specific criteria for a "good day":
*   Experiencing something new [17:17]
*   Helping someone else experience something new (e.g., a new food taste) [17:20]
*   Meeting someone he wants to keep in touch with [17:39]

If one of these criteria is met, he considers it a "very very good day" and feels grateful [17:42]. He is "constantly looking for opportunities" to learn and experience new things [17:52].

## Overcoming Failure

Both R. Madhavan and the host share personal stories of [[learning_from_failures | overcoming failure]] and how these experiences contributed significantly to their [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | purpose in life]].

### The Ordeal of *Rocketry*
Madhavan recounts the "horrifying" challenge of directing *Rocketry*, a role he never expected [06:49]. He was solely responsible for writing, producing, directing, and acting in three languages, with live sound across eight global locations, having never directed before [06:14]. Standing on set, with 150 people ready to "pass judgment" and believing he was making the "biggest mistake of your career" [06:54], caused immense stress.

He recalls feeling like Arjuna before Krishna, overwhelmed and ready to give up [07:21]. A friend's timely call advised him to take "one step at a time, one shot at a time" [08:00]. This experience taught him the greatest lesson in stress management: "Look right in front of your step. Just take that one step and the next step" [08:50]. This approach enabled him to complete the film [08:53]. He emphasizes that stress is a constant monster, even at his career stage [09:08].

### Early Academic Setbacks
Madhavan flunked in the eighth standard, getting 39% in mathematics, which devastated his parents who envisioned him joining Tata Steel [00:59:58]. This was a significant "failure situation" [00:59:44]. He later refused an engineering college admission, leading to a tearful conversation with his father who asked, "What have I done wrong with you?" [01:00:53]. Madhavan asserted that he didn't want a 9-to-5 job and asked for the "liberty to try and follow the line that I want to" [01:01:31].

### The Host's College Experience
The host shares his own experience of being a top student until college, where "a combination of alcohol, heartbreak and unaccountability" led him to fail exams and hit "the bottom" of his class [01:09:50]. This "fall from grace" exposed him to the "humiliation" and "resentment" that comes with failure [01:10:00]. He even experienced a "flash of a thought" about suicide due to the treatment he received, but the thought of his loved ones prevented him [01:10:50].

Madhavan advises the host that this difficult period was "life's way of preparing you for where you had to go" [01:10:50]. He views such experiences as tools that teach resilience: "The next time you faced a similar situation brother, the next time you faced this much of a downfall, you know that you can you've gone to the pits of it and have come back. So this is nothing" [01:10:50]. The humiliation and ego-swallowing learned in college are crucial for future challenges [01:10:50].

> "Life can throw a spanner now and you can still go that do go lose everything come to that point and still know that you can come back to where you are because you've done it before."<br><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>

The host reflects that what felt like a "cut" at the time was actually a "sword" he was given [01:10:50]. Madhavan agrees, stating, "Most important weapon is being able to deal with failure. That's the one thing that's going to be your best friend all your life" [01:10:50].

### *Saala Khadoos* and Learning from Setbacks
Madhavan recounts a similar situation with his film *Saala Khadoos*, where after 1.5 years of preparation, the producer backed out due to it being "women oriented" [01:10:50]. He was "disgusted" and ready to drop the project [01:10:50]. A friend from Los Angeles advised him against giving up, warning that giving up early sets a precedent for future challenges, leading to smaller successes [01:10:50]. This motivated him to "push through it" and make the film [01:10:50].

> "I love the failures, man. I love all that it teaches me. It teaches me what I'm capable of rising from. It's it's not it's not being preachy here. I'm telling you, that's one of the biggest uh biggest tools and successes I've had in my life is to overcome my failures."<br><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>

### Navigating Online Negativity
Madhavan acknowledges the challenge of dealing with online negativity, noting that people tend to focus on a few bad comments over many good ones [01:07:44]. He advises that "only a fool... will change his way of working because of those two comments" [01:08:31]. He trains his mother to understand that negativity is the "price" of celebrity, rather than changing his actions [01:09:03].

In conclusion, both individuals emphasize that challenges and setbacks are not hindrances but rather essential catalysts for [[utilizing_criticism_and_challenges_for_selfimprovement | self-improvement]] and greater achievements.

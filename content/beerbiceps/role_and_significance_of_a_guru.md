A Guru is a central figure in the journey of [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth_and_societal_evolution | spiritual]] growth, serving as a guide, teacher, and catalyst for profound inner transformation. The role extends beyond conventional teaching, often involving the transmission of knowledge and experiences that transcend ordinary understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Defining the Guru
The Sanskrit word 'Darshan' (Das) means "face to face," implying that any school of philosophy (dasas) ultimately aims to bring one face to face with the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:54">[02:24:54]</a>. Similarly, a Guru facilitates a direct encounter with deeper realities.

## Shri M's Encounter with his Guru
Shri M's personal journey highlights the profound impact of a Guru:
*   **The First Meeting**
    At nine years old, Shri M encountered a tall, fair man with matted hair, carrying a kamandal and a rudraksha garland, in his backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This individual, later identified as his Guru Maheswar Babaji, placed a hand on Shri M's head and told him, "When the time comes, you will remember everything. Everything will be fine. Go back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
    *   This physical contact left a lasting sensation of warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Awakening and Memories**
    After this encounter, Shri M's life began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. He started to have memories of being an embryo, powerless yet flooded with past memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. These pre-birth memories disappeared upon birth, but were later rediscovered through deep introspection into his layers of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This phenomenon aligns with Krishna's teaching in the [[life_lessons_from_the_bhagavad_gita | Bhagavad Gita]] that "I am the one who gives memories, I am also the one who wipes it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Beginning of Sadhana**
    From that day, Shri M began to meditate without prior instruction, experiencing a warm feeling and a spinning light in his navel, spreading bliss throughout his body every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This led him to read about the Upanishads and other texts, deepening his meditative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

## Guidance from Gurus and Holy Men
During his youth, Shri M providentially met numerous [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth_and_societal_evolution | spiritual]] persons, holy men, Yogis, and Swamis who offered blessings and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

*   **Verbal Instructions**
    *   Swami Abhedananda, living in the Fort area of Thiruvananthapuram, advised him to focus on chanting the name of God instead of complex Kundalini practices, insisting he share meals with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
    *   A Vaishnava Sadhu advised caution before renouncing the world, warning that failure after significant progress could be more devastating than at the beginning of the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. He gave the example of Adi Shankara's guru sending him back to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Verbal Instructions**
    *   Gopala Swami, an advanced Yogi disguised as a clerk, placed his hand on Shri M's head, changing his perception and making him realize the existence of things beyond the three-dimensional world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

## Seeking the Ultimate Guru
At age 19, Shri M felt a strong urge for a tangible spiritual experience and believed a Guru was waiting for him in the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

> "If you are at a place where you say if I don't get a proper guide, I will I'm going to die, definitely there's a teacher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

Despite initial discouragement from the Raol (head priest) of Badrinath Temple, who advised him to return home, Shri M persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. On the verge of suicide due to disillusionment, he returned to Vyas Gufa, where he found his Guru, Maheswar Babaji, waiting by a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. This reunion was a profound moment, affirming the Guru's presence even after a period of wandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

## Life with the Guru in the Himalayas
Shri M spent three and a half years with Maheswar Babaji, wandering and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. This period was a "crash course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>:
*   **Telepathic Understanding**: The Guru often knew Shri M's thoughts before he spoke them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Maheswar Babaji taught Shri M all five *Darshanas* (schools of philosophy) – Sankhya, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Vedanta, and Yoga – without books, drawing knowledge from his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.
*   **Practical Training**: The Guru prepared Shri M for future teaching assignments, ensuring he understood various fields of [[influence_of_ancient_hindu_teachings_on_modern_spirituality | ancient Hindu teachings]] to engage with diverse individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>.
*   **[[role_and_practice_of_tantra_and_sadhana | Kriya Yoga]] Practice**: Shri M's primary practice under his Guru was [[role_and_practice_of_tantra_and_sadhana | Kriya Yoga]], taught from the lineage of Sri Guru Babaji (Mahavatar Babaji) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. This practice is a systematic way of raising awareness from the gross to the subtle, focusing on the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mahavatar Babaji is considered the eternal Guru, known by many names like Sri Guru Babaji and the 'Deathless Guru' mentioned by Gorakhnath, existing until the end of the Kali Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. His purpose was to revive [[role_and_practice_of_tantra_and_sadhana | Kriya Yoga]] as a methodical way of spiritual transcendence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>.

## The Guru's Mandate
After his training, Maheswar Babaji instructed Shri M to return to the world, get married, settle down, and teach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. The Guru emphasized that to teach ordinary human beings, one must experience their life first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Shri M was also instructed not to teach until he received a "green signal" from his Guru, which he followed until the age of 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>.

## Importance of a Stable Guru
Shri M stresses the necessity of a "stable, experienced Guru" to teach spiritual techniques like [[role_and_practice_of_tantra_and_sadhana | Kundalini]] awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Without proper preparation and guidance, the powerful energy released can overwhelm the mind and body, potentially leading to mental instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Shri M expresses concern about teachers who impart techniques without adequately preparing the student or remaining reachable for guidance, as the spiritual journey involves unexplored territory with potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

## The Guru's Ever-present Role
A Guru's role is not static. If their function is complete, they may depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. However, the influence and guidance can continue, as demonstrated by Shri M's continuous internal re-learning of his Guru's teachings in preparation for his mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. The ultimate purpose of a Guru is to help individuals recognize the divine element within themselves and transcend the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>.

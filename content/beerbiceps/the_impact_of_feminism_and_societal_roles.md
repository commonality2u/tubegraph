Nora Fatehi and the interviewer discuss the evolving landscape of feminism and its [[cultural_observations_and_societal_changes | societal impact]], advocating for a return to traditional gender roles for a more balanced society.

## Views on Feminism
Nora Fatehi expresses a strong disbelief in the current wave of feminism, stating, "I don't believe in this at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. She contends that feminism has "fucked up our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. She feels that the concept of women being "inherently completely independent" and not pursuing marriage or children, or rejecting traditional male and female dynamics, is misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. While acknowledging that "feminism inherently on the base level is great," especially regarding [[empowerment_and_gender_equality | women's rights]] and education, she believes it has become "radicalized" and "dangerous for the society" in the last 15 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

She argues that this radicalization has led to suffering in families, for children, and women's mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>. She also notes a recent shift where people are questioning these extremes, seeking a "soft girl era" and "feminine energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

### Hormonal Cycles and Societal Design
The discussion also touches upon the biological differences between men and women, particularly concerning hormonal cycles. A video clip highlights that female physiology, operating on a 28-day hormonal cycle, is not designed for the traditional 8-to-5 corporate grind, which is suited for men's 24-hour testosterone cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. Women experience different hormonal patterns daily and need more sleep, creativity, and schedule variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. The modern societal structure, largely built during the Industrial Revolution, is tailored for men, leading to burnout for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Nora Fatehi "totally agree[s]" with this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

## Traditional Gender Roles
Nora Fatehi champions the idea that societal equilibrium comes from both men and women fulfilling their respective traditional roles. She believes women are naturally "nurturers" who should "go to work and have their own life and be independent but to a certain extent they should also be ready to take on the role of being a mother and a wife and a nurturer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. Similarly, men should be ready to be "a provider and a breadwinner and a father and a husband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. She refers to this as the "normal way of thinking," contrasting it with radical feminism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

### Men's Masculine Energy
She expresses concern that modern society has caused men to lose their "masculine energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>. She defines masculine energy as being ready to be a "provider," "supporter," and "protective role in the society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Many men now, influenced by feminism, want "equality in everything," including protection and providing, which Nora deems "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>. She feels that if men embrace their roles as providers and protectors, women can then focus on being nurturers and supporters, creating balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>.

## Modern Challenges and Relationships
The conversation touches on the difficulties of dating in the modern age, especially within the industry. Nora Fatehi observes that many people in the industry engage in marriages for "clout," networking, money, or relevancy, rather than love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. She finds it "crazy" to sacrifice personal life and mental health for professional gains, equating it to a "predatory" act if done without the partner's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

She admits to having built a barrier around herself due to a "terrible experience" in a past relationship, which was "something deeper, darker, scarier" than mere cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>. This experience has made her guarded, filtering people and prioritizing her career to "prove so many people wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Despite this, she affirms her belief in love and God, but notes her distrust in "humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. She also asserts that "girls are not sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>, describing many women as "crazy," "conniving," "great actors in real life," and capable of emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Growth
Nora Fatehi describes herself as a "workaholic" constantly balancing her career in India and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. She aims for lead roles in films, reflecting a decade-long struggle of "climbing up those stairs" from special features and small roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Her self-made journey, leaving her home country to establish a flourishing career, has added "layers and layers of personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

She acknowledges her "sharpened up" personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a> and directness, which can be intimidating to others, especially those who prefer "someone quiet, submissive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. She has learned to cope with constant public scrutiny and online negativity, choosing to speak freely on podcasts because people "are okay to talk about me all the time" without considering her feelings or mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. She notes that her success, evidenced by billions of views and millions of followers, contradicts the negative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

She reveals missing many significant family moments, including her brother's wedding and the birth of his sons, due to chasing her dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Despite her success, she feels a constant need to prove herself, which stems from the immense sacrifices she has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

### Ambition and Balance
Nora is currently working towards an international career after signing a global record deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. She acknowledges that this ambition requires her "full undivided attention," leading her to abstain from dating, vacations, or partying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. She expresses a desire for both career success and a personal life, wanting to be a mother and wife while also taking over the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
The discussion concludes with the idea that self-awareness, maturity, and life experiences are crucial for navigating societal pressures and personal relationships. Nora Fatehi believes that people are currently experiencing immense anxiety and depression because they have been forced into a "dog race" they are not meant for, advocating for a return to moderation and balance in societal ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>. She hopes that her unfiltered perspective will help others understand themselves better and find light in their own journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

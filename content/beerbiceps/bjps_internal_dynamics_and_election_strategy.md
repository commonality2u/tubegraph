The internal workings and electoral strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are discussed, highlighting concerns about leadership, decision-making, and the party's future direction.

## Internal Party Structure and Leadership
Historically, the BJP (and its predecessors like Jan Sangh and Janata Party) maintained a robust internal democratic process, including regular elections for leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. This system, described as "one of the finest" since Jan Sangh days, has been "thoroughly disrupted" by [[Prime Minister Modis leadership style | Prime Minister Modi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

Currently, the party's internal structure is described as "broken up," with "everything is nominated by Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. The internal dynamics are characterized by a lack of healthy team spirit, where it's essentially "Modi and then Sano Panza," with others like Amit Shah simply obeying orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

Ministers in the current cabinet are generally perceived as lacking independence, being "picked up because they would be a cat" and "won't have a spine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. They are expected to always align with Modi's wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. However, some exceptions, like Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, are noted for their ability to "stand up" and "speak up frankly" when they believe something is wrong, though their views are often not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Criticism of Current BJP Leadership
Concerns are raised regarding [[Prime Minister Modis leadership style | Prime Minister Modi's]] conduct, including:
*   **Dishonesty and False Claims** He is accused of telling lies, such as claiming no Chinese intrusion into Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, and taking credit for achievements he had no part in, like the Supreme Court's clearance of the Ram Mandir project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency** There is a perceived absence of transparency within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Intolerance and Expulsions** Modi is described as intolerant, having removed many from the party, including figures like Jethmalani and Kirti Azad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, some individuals with strong roots in the Hindu nationalist movement, like Dr. Subramanian Swamy, remain difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Economic Mismanagement**
    *   Economic growth figures, such as the 8-9% GDP growth, are deemed "bogus" and manipulated, as they include inflation and the real growth rate is closer to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
    *   Policies like high income tax rates and hiking interest rates are criticized for discouraging the public and not addressing the demand side of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.
    *   High income taxes are seen as not contributing to national development but rather to personal pockets of officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Issues** [[Indias foreign policy | India's foreign policy]] under Modi is questioned for lacking clarity on alliances (e.g., being non-aligned yet buying junk from Russia) and for perceived weakness in dealing with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. It is asserted that Modi is "blackmailed" by the Chinese, explaining the lack of strong action regarding [[Chinas political dynamics | Chinese occupation]] of Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

> "He tells lies he claims credit for gamand he had no contribution in doing anything about getting the Supreme Court to clear the ram the project it was I who did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>
> "that money is not used for our development essentially the country is losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
> "yes it will be a 19 30 of United States we'll be in a massive depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
> "what's the difficulty with PM Modi he tells lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>

## Election Season Outlook
With the upcoming election season, it is suggested that the BJP should fight without [[Prime Minister Modis leadership style | Mr. Modi]] to leverage the "Hindutva issue" fully, as his presence might dilute it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. It is argued that Modi should either not contest or lose the election, as he is "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" due to a perceived belief in "dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. This concern draws parallels to historical figures like Hitler and Putin, who started as perceived democrats but became authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

It is predicted that if Modi is reinstated after the elections, he might seek to postpone future elections, believing the country is "totally with him" and he can do "what he likes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

Despite these criticisms, a BJP victory is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## Outlook on the Future of Indian Politics
The [[Indian political landscape | Indian political landscape]] is evolving, with a growing number of educated individuals and PhDs entering politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. There is a sense that India is "shaping up very well" and is no longer as subservient as during Jawaharlal Nehru's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. There is hope for more entrepreneurs to enter politics, bringing financial independence that could foster greater independence from party leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

For a nation to become a "first factor" globally, it needs robust economic policy changes, including sustained 10% annual growth, and the ability to militarily defeat nations like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

On the issue of [[Corruption and financial issues in Indian politics | corruption]], it is stressed that while corruption has always existed, the current situation is one of "plunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This money is often not reinvested within India but deposited in foreign banks, leading to the country's loss of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The electoral bond scandal is cited as a "mighty scandal" with ongoing revelations about companies receiving government contracts despite being bankrupt or having "dirty money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

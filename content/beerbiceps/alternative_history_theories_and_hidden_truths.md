## Uncovering Forgotten Truths with Praveen Mohan

Praveen Mohan, a highly requested guest, dedicates his time to exploring ancient sites in India and globally to uncover truths about the past that may have been forgotten or downplayed in a world that often shuns alternative history theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He conducts these archaeological missions independently, documenting a small portion (10%) on his YouTube channel, which has captivated a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Mohan believes that history taught in schools, especially in India, is outdated, written decades ago, and contains a calculated bias designed to spread misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The globalized nature of information dissemination today allows individuals like Mohan to share findings that challenge traditional narratives, quickly exposing inaccuracies in history books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Challenges to Mainstream Historical Narratives

Praveen Mohan notes that while much of North and Central India's ancient temples have been demolished due to centuries of invasions, South India retains many intact temples and ancient secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. He states that the narrative of Indian history often suggests that significant civilization only began after the Mughal and European arrivals, portraying earlier periods as primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. He questions why Indians are more familiar with Mughal kings than ancient Indian dynasties like the Cholas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Mohan suggests a "calculated plan" behind this misinformation, preventing a full understanding of the true nature of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>.

## Evidence of Advanced Ancient Technologies

Mohan, an engineer by background, identifies instances of advanced technology in ancient Indian temples that contradict the idea that they were built solely with primitive tools like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.

*   **Lathe Technology**: Pillars in temples like Hoysaleswara and Chennakesava in Karnataka exhibit perfect circular shapes and "turn marks," indicating they were made using lathe machines. Archaeologists confirm this, despite the implication that massive, perhaps 300-400 meter long, lathe machines would have been required for 20-ton pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>. The existence of such technology, and its apparent disappearance, poses a significant historical puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
*   **Hollow Stone Carvings**: In a dark temple, Mohan found a stone carving of a "dwar palika" (doorkeeper) with a crown studded with 1-inch hollow stone skulls. A thread could be passed through the ear, eye, and mouth, demonstrating an intricate hollow structure impossible to create with basic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.
*   **Earthquake-Proof Construction**: The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, dating back 800-900 years, gained UNESCO World Heritage status due to its unique construction. Its bricks are unusually light and float in water, similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. This lightweight material allowed the temple to largely withstand a massive earthquake that destroyed all other structures in the area, indicating ancient Indian builders possessed early forms of earthquake-proofing technology, akin to techniques used by modern Japanese builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. This challenges the notion of primitive tools and suggests an advanced understanding of engineering and [[impact_of_geological_events_on_historical_narratives | geological events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>.

## The Enigma of Architectural Evolution

Mohan highlights a key inconsistency in historical understanding: the absence of a clear evolutionary pattern in ancient Indian architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. Unlike modern construction where buildings evolve (Eiffel Tower to CN Tower to Burj Khalifa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, India's largest and oldest cave temple (Ajanta Caves) and dam (Kallanai Dam, 2,000 years old) are the same structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. The Kailasa Temple, carved out of a single mountain 1,300 years ago, also stands alone without a precursor or successor in terms of complexity and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. This lack of an evolutionary pattern suggests either a sudden, unexplained leap in technology or the existence of a prior, more advanced civilization whose knowledge was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.

## The True Purpose of Ancient Temples

Praveen Mohan, having grown up in temples and spending hours inside them when closed, gained a unique perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. He argues that ancient temples were not merely places of worship but functioned as "Wikipedia in stone" or "town museums" designed to transmit knowledge across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

*   **Multi-layered Education**: Temples feature carvings at different eye-levels corresponding to age groups.
    *   **Ages 0-5**: Lowest levels depict animals, functioning as an "Animal Planet" or "Discovery Channel" in stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.
    *   **Ages 6-10**: Mid-levels show music and dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.
    *   **Ages 11-15**: Carvings related to science and technology, such as a sundial in the Konark Temple accurate to the minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
    *   **Ages 16-20**: Depictions of war, administration, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.
    *   **Ages 21-25**: Extensive erotica and depictions of love-making, normalizing human sexuality in a "free Indian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.
    *   **Beyond 25**: Only at the highest levels are the Gods depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.
*   **Medical and Social Practices**: Temples also documented ancient medical practices, such as women giving birth while standing (now a recommended practice for gravity assistance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>, and post-birth disinfection methods using smoke from specific herbs, still practiced by tribes like the Bonda in Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

The use of stone ensured these messages would endure, even through destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

## The Naga Mystery and Ancient Civilizations

Mohan connects the widespread worship of Nagas (serpent deities) across ancient cultures globally to a shared, hidden history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

*   **Nagas as a Distinct Species**: In Hindu texts like the Mahabharata, Nagas are not merely snakes or humans but a distinct species or race of humanoids capable of shapeshifting and living in subterranean levels ("Paatalaloka") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Carvings in Mahabalipuram reportedly show Nagas transforming from snake-like forms to human-like forms emerging from underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
*   **Global Presence and Terminology**: Naga-like entities are found in Peru (Amaru), Colombia (guarding Lingams), Israel (Nakash, a term similar to Naga), and biblical serpents (Saraf, similar to Hindu Sarpa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. This global commonality of names and worship suggests a shared ancient narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **First Rulers**: Ancient civilizations, such as Cambodia, describe their first rulers as Naga kings or queens, like Soma, a Naga woman who married a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. This suggests that Nagas were perceived as the original ancestors or civilizers of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   **Dinosaur/Extinct Animal Carvings**: Mohan points to carvings like a Stegosaurus in the Ta Prohm temple in Cambodia and a four-tusked elephant (an ancestor of mammoths) in Angkor Wat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>. Since dinosaurs and such elephants are believed to have been extinct for millions or hundreds of thousands of years before these temples were built, their accurate depiction raises questions about the sculptors' knowledge sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>. The prevalence of dragon-like carvings in Hindu temples also prompts the question of whether they depict actual dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.
*   **"Beings from the Sky"**: Local villagers near ancient stone huts (like in K. Bellino, Karnataka) describe short "beings that came from the sky" who civilized humans, taught them construction technology, and then vanished. These beings are associated with Nagas and are often found near ancient temples where Nagas are worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. Mohan suggests this indicates that [[speculations_on_ancient_advanced_civilizations_and_lost_history | ancient advanced civilizations]] or even extraterrestrial contact may be a part of [[lost history | lost history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

## Confronting Censorship and Bias in Modern Platforms

Mohan shares that platforms like YouTube have demonetized or banned his videos for challenging mainstream narratives, often citing "nudity" in carvings of Hindu gods, even male Jain gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. He argues this is a form of censorship that discourages creators from covering Hindu temples, creating a "racist angle" as similar nude carvings of Greek gods in Western museums are not banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. This deliberate action, he believes, consciously programs people away from exploring and promoting Hindu temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.

## A Call to Critical Thinking

Praveen Mohan encourages listeners to approach history with an open mind and critical thinking, rather than accepting information at face value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. He emphasizes that there are serious holes in traditional history and archaeology books, and that humanity is likely not the most advanced civilization to have existed on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. His work, like that of Graham Hancock, aims to uncover this [[conspiracy_theories_and_untold_narratives | Real History]] which is currently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>.

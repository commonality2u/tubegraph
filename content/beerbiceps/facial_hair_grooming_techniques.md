[[basic_male_grooming_tips_for_indian_men | Male grooming]] is essential for looking handsome, especially for young Indian men who often deal with issues like acne and oily skin in high humidity environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Looking handsome is more about appearing neat and tidy than what one is born with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Grooming Facial Hair

Getting one's facial hair game correct is crucial for young men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. There are three primary approaches to facial hair:
1.  **Growing out a beard entirely** and maintaining it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Stylizing a beard**, such as opting for a goatee or a soul patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Going clean shaven** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Mustaches

It is advised not to sport a mustache, especially for young men, as it can make them look like a "child molester" rather than older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Mustaches are considered very "historic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Clean Shaving

Being clean shaven is the "golden way" or "evergreen way" of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Nothing conveys cleanliness and tidiness as much as a clean-shaven face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Shaving Gear

The quality of shaving gear is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For instance, the Gillette Mach3 Turbo is noted for its:
*   **Strong and durable blades**, which means less frequent replacement and cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Excellent grip**, which helps prevent cuts, especially when shaving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Spring-mounted blades**, allowing for a precision shave and easier navigation around pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Grooming Secondary Facial Hair

Secondary facial hair includes hair that people often notice if not taken care of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Ear Hair

Many Indian men experience hair growing out of their ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. A regular razor can be used to shave it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Nose Hair

For nose hair, a super narrow and sharp pair of small scissors should be used to trim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Unibrow

A unibrow (hair growing in the middle of the eyebrows) can significantly detract from one's "handsome game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Every guy should own a pair of tweezers for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Tweezers Selection and Use
*   **Quality:** A good quality pair of tweezers will cost around 100-200 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Sharpness Check:** To ensure sharpness, the two ends of the tweezers should match exactly when joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Technique:** Focus on tweezing only the super thick hairs between the eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Natural Look:** Do not entirely clean shave the area. Leave a few strands of hair to ensure it looks natural and like there are two distinct eyebrows, not one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

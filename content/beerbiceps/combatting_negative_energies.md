The topic of [[demonic_and_negative_energies | ghosts]] and unseen presences has been a significant part of the speaker's life since childhood. Growing up, the speaker often questioned whether human presence was "all that there is" or if there was a deeper, unseen layer to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Horror movies further fueled this curiosity, suggesting the existence of phenomena beyond normal perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Childhood Fears and Sleep Paralysis

The speaker's childhood home, which had a family-owned hospital on the ground floor and living quarters on the third, was a place where fear of the dark was pervasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Even in his own house, a feeling of being watched or the presence of "some kind of energy" was constant in dark, solitary rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This extended into a prolonged period where the speaker couldn't sleep alone until the age of 19 or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Around age 11, the speaker began experiencing sleep paralysis, a scientific phenomenon where one partially wakes up during sleep but the brain signals the muscular system not to move, resulting in temporary paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This is a body's protection mechanism to prevent physical reaction to dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. In severe cases, nightmares can blend with reality, making the experience terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The speaker's sleep paralysis often involved waking up to see a shadowy figure in the room, with the only escape being to close his eyes and hope for sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### The Terrifying Encounter

One particular experience at age 11, while sleeping next to his mother, stands out as the most terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The speaker felt "shadowy creatures" or a "shadowy power" chaining him down to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. These creatures screamed, seemingly welcoming a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. A woman with pale, torn, blistered skin, untidy hair, and one pale red eye then appeared, sitting on top of him and staring down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Despite feeling her weight and fingers on his chest, the speaker was unable to move or scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

Due to growing up in a [[spirituality_meditation_and_maintaining_a_positive_aura | spiritual]] family, his mother had taught him a specific mantra to ward off [[demonic_and_negative_energies | bad spirits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The speaker closed his eyes and began chanting "Om Namah Shivaya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. He continued chanting while feeling the weight, and upon opening his eyes later, the woman was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

### Post-Encounter Confirmation

Two years later, at age 13, the speaker watched a National Geographic show about alien abductions, which featured a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon where sleep paralysis is accompanied by a witch sitting on top of the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The visual representation of this "witch" on the show was an exact match to what the speaker had seen: the same single eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, untidy clothes, and pale, dead eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This unnerving confirmation led to him struggling to sleep alone for another 7 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear Through Spirituality and Meditation

The speaker eventually overcame this phobia by embracing [[spirituality_meditation_and_maintaining_a_positive_aura | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | Spirituality]], beyond meditation and good karma, also delves into the [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | spirit world]], the astral world, and how to tackle [[demonic_and_negative_energies | dark energies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. A key teaching, from the autobiography of a yogi, states that "when you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

The speaker actively worked on strengthening his "spiritual muscle of [his] mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. He started meditating extensively around age 22 or 23, often with his co-founder, Rajas, in their garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

### Shared Meditation Experience

During one particular late-night meditation session in darkness, both the speaker and Rajas felt an extremely "dark" presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Recognizing the shared energy during meditation, the speaker recalled the advice to face fear and chanted the "Om Namah Shivaya" mantra again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. They both felt that they successfully "pushed out some kind of a [[demonic_and_negative_energies | negative energy]]" from the room and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. After the meditation, Rajas immediately confirmed the shared feeling by asking, "Did you feel that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## Psychic Confirmation and Building History

Further validation came from a psychic friend who visited their office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. The psychic friend, without being told anything, went directly to the end of the corridor, to a room located exactly below the speaker's childhood bedroom where the sleep paralysis incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. The friend stated that this specific room had "a lot of [[demonic_and_negative_energies | dark energy]]" and had likely housed "some kind of a [[demonic_and_negative_energies | demon]] or a [[demonic_and_negative_energies | ghost]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. They also confirmed that the regular meditation practices had likely pushed out this entity by making the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

Upon consulting his grandfather, who had run the hospital in the building since the 1960s, the speaker learned about similar experiences reported by patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. Over 50 years, patients in those same rooms would report feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night, or even being pushed off their hospital beds by a "flash of a really scary looking woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

Currently, the hospital is defunct, and the [[demonic_and_negative_energies | negative presence]] is no longer felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Since the psychic's examination, pujas, Havens, and candle lighting have been performed to create a more positive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

The speaker's deep-seated fear of the dark was rooted in the perception of an entity staring at him from childhood into his teenage years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. This fear was overcome by facing it and pushing it out through the positivity cultivated by [[protection_through_meditation_and_spirituality | spiritual practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that while he is not an advisor for [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | occult experiences]], he believes that [[protection_through_meditation_and_spirituality | spiritual practices]] are helpful in combating the [[demonic_and_negative_energies | occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

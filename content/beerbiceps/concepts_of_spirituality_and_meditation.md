This article explores various concepts within [[spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality and meditation]], drawing insights from Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. The discussion covers topics ranging from personal spiritual journeys to the nature of consciousness, higher beings, and the practice of Kriya Yoga.

## The Purpose of Spirituality and Meditation

The purpose of [[spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]] and [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] is to help individuals understand the meaning of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It addresses how spiritual entities fit into the world of spiritualism and aims to expand the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. The ultimate aim of life is to expand spiritually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>. Shri M emphasizes that in every living being, especially humans who can recognize it, there is a divine element at the essence of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. The goal is to turn the mind around and find this divine element, moving from the ordinary to that which is beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>.

## Shri M's Early Spiritual Journey

Shri M's spiritual journey began early in life. Krishna in the Gita states that he is the one who gives memories and also wipes them out, a process that happens to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Shri M recounts that until age nine, his memories were normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. However, after his Guru, Maheshwar Babaji, laid a hand on his head, he started having memories from "before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, including being an embryo, powerless and unable to move, yet flooded with past memories that later disappeared upon birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

At nine years old, while playing in his backyard, Shri M encountered a tall, matted-haired person (his Guru) standing under a jackfruit tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This person asked if he remembered anything, to which Shri M replied no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. The Guru then placed his hand on Shri M's head, saying in Hindi, "When the time comes, you will remember everything; everything will be fine," and told him to go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. This encounter marked the beginning of a profound change in Shri M's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

From that day, Shri M's [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] practice began spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Each night around midnight, he would awaken to a warm, swirling light in his navel area that spread throughout his body, bringing a feeling of blissfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This became a daily occurrence, deepening his understanding of many things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. He developed a desire to read about the Upanishads and other scriptures, with books often coming to him unasked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. He also began meeting various spiritual persons, holy men, Yogis, and Swamis in his area, receiving blessings and instructions, both verbal and non-verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. These interactions led him to realize that the world was not merely three-dimensional and that his calling was to seek ultimate happiness and the infinite Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

## The Himalayan Journey and Guru's Teachings

At the age of 19, Shri M felt a strong desire for a tangible spiritual experience and believed someone was waiting for him in the Himalayas to teach him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. Despite the lack of modern navigation tools, he embarked on a month-long journey to Badrinath, facing hardships like cold and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. Along the way, he met various people, including wise and simple yogis, as well as those who might lead one astray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. He received warnings about the dangers of renouncing the world without being truly ready, likening it to falling from a great height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

Upon reaching Badrinath, he sought a Guru but received discouraging responses from the local priest who suggested he return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. Feeling disillusioned and contemplating suicide at the edge of the Alaknanda river, he decided to meditate first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. He returned to a nearby cave and found his Guru, Maheshwar Babaji, waiting by a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Shri M pledged never to leave him, and he stayed with his Guru for nearly three and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>. During this period, he learned extensively, describing it as a "crash course" that covered what would take 10 years in a university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. His Guru carried no books but taught from his own knowledge, covering various Indian philosophical schools (darshanas) like Samkhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, Vedanta, and Yoga, all aimed at reaching the truth face-to-face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.

## Understanding Kriya Yoga

While learning various philosophical schools, Shri M's primary practice was Kriya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. The word "Kriya" in yoga shastras simply means "practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:30]</a>. The specific set of Kriya teachings he received came from the lineage of Sri Guru Babaji, who has been known for thousands of years and is believed to exist until the end of the Kali Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.

Kriya Yoga is described as a very systematic and methodical way of transcending the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. It is considered one of the fastest forms of [[spirituality_and_meditation | spiritual advancement]], provided one follows its rules, practices diligently, and with care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. Kriya primarily involves raising one's awareness from the gross to the subtle, with attention to the spine (Sushumna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>. The mind, usually caught in gross forms of energy, is guided to subtler levels by moving awareness through different parts of the spine, becoming finer until it understands the origin of the human substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

For Shri M, after years of practice, Kriya is now an enjoyable activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. It has opened many dimensions of his mind, allowing him to shift his mind from lower to higher levels of consciousness at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. In the Indian system of thought, when the mind is free, it reflects Divinity, which is not an external God but the divine spark existing within us, the core of one's own consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.

## Kundalini Energy

Shri M prefers to avoid the term "Kundalini" due to its exploitation, but he explains it as the entire energy of the universe, complete and depicted as feminine creative energy (Parashakti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>. This energy first operates as sex, being the same energy but expressed differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>. Kundalini, also known as "Serpent Power" because it is coiled like a snake at the base of the spine (Muladhara chakra), awakens to create another human being through sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>.

A Yogi, instead of allowing this energy to primarily express sexually, controls it and makes it ascend the spine, transforming it into a spiritually creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:00">[53:43:00]</a>. Kriya is one of the practices meant to turn this energy around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:11:00">[54:11:00]</a>. While some also use mantra chanting (Mantra Tantra) to awaken it, the best approach is a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:00">[54:24:00]</a>.

The time it takes for Kundalini to awaken and mature varies based on an individual's stage of growth and past life factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:43:00">[54:43:00]</a>. Shri M advises that it is better for the process to happen slowly and maturely rather than suddenly, as the energy is powerful and can overwhelm the mind and body, potentially leading to mental instability if unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:27:00">[55:27:00]</a>. He expresses concern about teachers who provide techniques without proper preparation and follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:00">[56:18:00]</a>.

Kundalini rising to the Sahasrara (crown chakra) is generally associated with Moksha or Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>. However, illumination can also occur without systematic Kriya practice in individuals whose minds are purified over many lives, sometimes opening in other centers like the Heart Center (Anahata), bringing bliss without formal understanding of Kundalini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:00">[57:58:00]</a>.

## Dimensions and Consciousness

Shri M discusses dimensions beyond the typical three (X, Y, Z) and the fourth dimension of time. He states that "Shiva" is an abstract concept, not a physical deity, but the ultimate essence of all dimensions put together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. It symbolizes Bliss, auspiciousness, and the Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. The concept of the "third eye," often depicted with Shiva, represents a special faculty needed to understand concepts beyond ordinary dimensions, implying that our current senses are limited to the third dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Only when other sensory perceptions open up can one begin to grasp the next dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.

To illustrate, Shri M uses the analogy of two-dimensional wafer-thin beings in a transparent box, unable to conceive of moving vertically to cross a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. Similarly, humans are accustomed to three dimensions. One way to reach out to higher dimensions is to sit quietly and still, to [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditate]] more deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. When stillness happens, one is lifted from the ordinary dimension to something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. This means working on one's perception to be at a higher place, as the truth is everywhere and not linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

### Time and the Pineal Gland

Time is a psychological concept, based on change; if there were no change, there would be no time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. It is relative; an hour can feel long or short depending on interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. For a mosquito, two days is an entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. Going "beyond time" means understanding time, which leads to its disappearance and the realization that life is not just birth and death but a continuous process without a known origin, which can only be stopped by realizing its endless and useless nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

The human race needs to evolve further spiritually, beyond its current frontal lobe civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. The pineal gland, often associated with the third eye, is linked to the circadian rhythm (sleep and waking cycle) and produces melatonin, which contributes to feelings of bliss in deep [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>. Through yoga, one can consciously control the release of hormones like melatonin from the pineal gland through thought, visualization, one-pointed attention, calming the mind, and equalizing the breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. This practice, when attention is fixed between the eyebrows, can help one transcend from deep sleep into Turiya, a state of unceasing bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. The oldest reference to Kriya in the Gita (sixth chapter, Dhyana Yoga) advises sitting straight, keeping the spine and head steady, fixing attention in the Bhrumadhya (between eyebrows), balancing breath, and being free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Higher Beings and Other Realms

Shri M confirms the existence of higher beings, stating, "I don't believe in higher beings, I know that higher beings exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. He finds it limited to think that only human beings exist on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. These beings exist but are not always seen because their frequency of vibration is different from ours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. While some can see us, others are unconsciously present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

Ghosts, as commonly referenced, are generally products of imagination or lingering electrical charges from bodies that died suddenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. These charges take the shape of the body but have no intelligence and cannot hurt you directly, only through fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Possession, 90% of the time, is a psychological disease, though in rare cases, other beings (not necessarily demonic) can occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. There are both good and bad invisible beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. Good beings can encourage and help during [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Negative beings can influence by increasing desires, which can be dangerous for a spiritual seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. These influences often manifest as thoughts that seem like one's own but might be infused by external entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. This is why protective circles are drawn during [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] to keep away extraneous thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

Angels or Farishtas are different species of beings belonging to different dimensions, not merely "God's soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. They interpenetrate our world and can also come from other realms or even other universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. Shri M's Guru taught him about these beings because they are facts of existence, sometimes helpful, and understanding them allows one to avoid negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

Shri M recounts an encounter with a Yeti during an unsuccessful attempt to go to Kailash, where a furry, human-like being gave him a herbal medicine that saved him from a mountain fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. His Guru confirmed it was a Yeti, stating they are "good people" and not to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This experience confirmed the existence of such living creatures in remote mountain and forest areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

The Nagas, or hooded serpents, were once a species of beings that lived in another realm called Nagaloka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. In ancient times, they were teachers of humans and are still worshipped as symbols of wisdom, with Kundalini also being considered a Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. The cobras seen today are considered "decadent leftovers" of that species, as the original Nagas were recalled after forming relationships with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. While not as intelligent as their ancestors, cobras are more intelligent than common snakes and can recognize individuals in whom Kundalini is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>.

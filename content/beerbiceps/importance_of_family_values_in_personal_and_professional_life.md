The Chanchlani family exemplifies how strong family values, instilled from childhood, can significantly influence both personal character and professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The host of the interview expressed inspiration from Ashish and Muskan, attributing their success and positive influence in the industry to the [[parental_influence_and_support_in_career_choices | correct values]] given by their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Core Values and Their Impact

### Humility and Equality
A cornerstone of the family's teachings is [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | humility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Both Ashish and Muskan are described as very humble, treating everyone equally, including their household staff, with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This extends to having positive feelings for the success of others, rather than jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The family believes that true success is maintaining humility, staying "down to earth" regardless of achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Ashish learned from his mother the importance of acceptance and treating everyone equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Work Ethic and Independence
The family emphasizes the importance of hard work and earning one's own identity. Ashish's father shared that many "rich kids are sheltered," getting everything easy, but Ashish was working alongside him from a young age, starting around 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This early exposure to work, including regularly handling banking and contributing to the multiplex business, shaped a significant part of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Ashish's father, despite being the son of a wealthy man, felt pressure to establish himself, learning to "become a man on his own feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This lesson was passed on to Ashish, who never wanted to flaunt his family's money but instead desired to "be on my own feet, independent, earn on my own self and have my own identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Passion Over Immediate Riches
Initially, Ashish started his video work as a passion project, not driven by the desire to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. His mindset was to act, which he had wanted for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This passion-first approach, rather than focusing on immediate earnings, is seen as a key factor in his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Importance of Education and Long-Term Vision
When Ashish wanted to pursue acting, his father encouraged him to finish his engineering degree, emphasizing that passion is good, but education is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This highlights a balanced approach to career choices, valuing both academic qualifications and vocational pursuits.

### Resilience and Optimism
The children have learned the value of never giving up and maintaining a positive outlook. Muskan notes her mother's consistent positivity and optimism, always finding something good in every situation and never taking anything negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. From their father, they learned to "never give up" and to always love and respect everyone, regardless of how they are treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Parental Guidance and Support

### Mother's Support and Understanding
Ashish's mother initially struggled to understand his videos but eventually provided unwavering support, ensuring he had everything he needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. She learned to differentiate between his content and the abusive videos, showing a willingness to understand and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Her advice to other mothers is to allow their children to pursue their passions, giving them at least a year to see if they can succeed, without restriction, letting them "fly like a bird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Father's Mentorship and Life [[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | Lessons]]
Ashish's father shared his experience of interacting with film stars like Aamir Khan, teaching his children that fame is often tied to success, and that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. He noted that the "hunger for success makes you humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. His final advice to his children is to love what they do, take care of their health, and live a disciplined life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Balancing Career and Family Life
The family openly discusses their son's passion for content creation, even if it leads to him being in his "own world" or saying dialogues in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This acceptance and understanding from the parents is crucial for a creative career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, demonstrating how [[balancing_family_responsibilities_and_career | parental support]] can foster unique professional paths.

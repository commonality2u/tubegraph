Focus is a crucial factor for success in various aspects of life, including school, college, and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Maintaining maximum focus in minimal time is key to achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The ability to be focused directly correlates with achieving good marks or financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Being focused means staying in one place, switching off distractions, and remaining "glued" to one spot, thought, or work task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Factors that break focus include pains and worries like breakups, bad marks, insults, insecurities, performance pressure, and future anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These "enemies of focus" keep individuals "ungrounded," while being more grounded enhances the ability to stay focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Improving grounding is essential for better focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The human body is a culmination of everything consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Humans evolved from "cavemen" who spent centuries eating clean, fresh food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, in the last 100 to 200 years, eating habits have drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Impact of Modern Diet on Mental Clarity

Currently, many people fill their bodies with "packaged poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The more additives and processed sugar present in one's diet, the more "ungrounded" they will feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

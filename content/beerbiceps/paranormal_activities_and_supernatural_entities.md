The realm of [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal investigations and beliefs]], [[interaction with spirits and entities | interaction with spirits and entities]], and [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences and belief in ghosts]] is a complex and often frightening subject, explored through spiritual beliefs, personal [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings]], and even scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The podcast features horror writer Neil D'Silva, who shares insights from his research and work with [[Paranormal investigation techniques | paranormal investigators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This discussion delves into the nature of ghosts, various supernatural entities from Indian folklore, and the methods used by those who investigate these phenomena.

## The Nature of Ghosts and Entities

The general belief regarding the nature of a ghost's existence suggests that when a person experiences an unnatural death before their destined time, they may remain in this realm as a ghost, often in a state of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Categories of Ghosts and Spirits

Not all ghosts are considered evil; the majority are believed to be good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Evil ghosts are typically those with unfulfilled desires or who suffered an unjust or violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Specific entities from Indian folklore include:
*   **Chudel and Dian** – These entities share a similar origin theory: a woman who dies during childbirth or pregnancy, if not properly cremated with rituals, turns into a chudel due to latent desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As a chudel, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women, making her a vengeful entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Dian are similar in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Yakshini** – Described as demigoddesses, yakshinis are believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven, in Alkapuri, governed by Kubar, the brother of Ravana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. When they visit Earth, they often appear in evil forms, beautiful and voluptuous, but after their seductive allure fades, they reveal their true, malevolent nature, with men usually being their victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Pishach** – In Hindu mythology, a pishach (ghoul) is created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Unlike poltergeists, pishachs can kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Poltergeist** – These are described as noisy ghosts that are mischievous and naughty, aiming to disorient and sap energies, but they rarely kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Betal** – A hanging ghost, often formless, associated with banyan or peepal trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A betal is believed to be a man who died with unfulfilled wishes and remains attached to a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. They are said to haunt passersby, travel to their homes, and create havoc in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Perspectives on Hauntings

### Paranormal Investigators' Views
Neil D'Silva has studied the [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal world]] and met with [[Paranormal investigation techniques | paranormal investigators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He notes that no two [[Paranormal investigation techniques | paranormal investigators]] have the exact same theory for ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Jay Alani** – A rationalist who believes a significant part of the [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal world]] in India is commercially propagated blind faith and superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He seeks to distinguish real [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]] from fabricated ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He often finds that the root cause of hauntings is human mischief or an object carrying a spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Sarbajit M** – Believes that [[interaction with spirits and entities | paranormal energies]] are ubiquitous, existing as another dimension in our environment that can perceive us though we cannot interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. His team includes [[psychic_abilities and paranormal investigations | psychics]] who can visualize and sense these energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### Personal Accounts and Experiences
The host and Neil D'Silva, both horror writers, believe that a strong fear of the dark or childhood [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | experiences with the paranormal]] often leads one to write horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> "my own fears my own phobias that I had growing up they have landed in my books but in a different form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> - Neil D'Silva

Neil D'Silva has experienced [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | paranormal phenomena]] while writing horror, including feeling a cold presence and lights flickering in his room in Goa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The host has also had [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]], including a strong sleep paralysis experience that a psychic confirmed as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

A particularly scary story shared by Neil D'Silva involved a village near Baneswar where young men would mysteriously walk out of their homes at night, cross a highway, and hang themselves from a specific tree in a forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Sarbajit M and his team, including a psychic, investigated and found a "huge mass of black energy" around the tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. They encountered a mini-tornado and heard voices, seeing tall black shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Villagers attempting to cut the tree would fall sick, suggesting the tree itself resisted being cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## [[Cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | Cultural Perceptions]] and Folklore

India is rich in [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | spiritual wisdom]], but also has an underbelly of [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | occult sciences]] and black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Trees and Spirits
There is a common belief that trees can house spirits and serve as a safe haven for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. It is advised not to walk under banian or peepal trees at night due to the belief that a "betal" (hanging ghost) might reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Witchcraft and Black Magic
The host shares a personal [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | experience]] with a woman who claimed to be involved in [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | witchcraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. This encounter involved meeting at locations known for [[Experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings | ghost encounters]] and the host feeling dizzy, later confirmed by a psychic friend who sensed a "dark aura" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

Mayong, a village in Assam, is believed to be the birthplace of black magic in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Practitioners there are said to use black magic for healing, with tantrics and ojas performing mantras for spiritual cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

## Countering Paranormal Influence

Methods to counter dark energies and cleanse environments include:
*   **Chanting and Meditation** – The host found personal success in overcoming sleep paralysis and potential [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | occult experiences]] through mantra chanting and deep meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Salt Water Baths** – Believed to wash off negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying the Epicenter** – [[Paranormal investigation techniques | Investigators]] like Jay Alani focus on finding the source of a haunting, which can sometimes be an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Protective Fields** – A psychic friend of the host demonstrated a technique of rubbing hands and clapping to create a protective field and send away entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## The Science of the Paranormal

While science, particularly organic chemistry, relies on proof and formulas, the world of the [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal]] lacks direct evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### Limitations of Current Technology
*   **K2 Meters (EMF Detectors)** – These devices measure electromagnetic fields (EMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. A simple K2 meter has five lights, with one always blinking due to ambient EMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. In certain places, all five lights may illuminate without a known reason, leading to the inference of a ghostly entity, but a direct visual proof of the ghost is still lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

Despite technological advancements, such as the ability to record and play back dreams in Japan, direct visual or physical proof of ghosts remains elusive to the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. However, it's suggested that as technology advances, there might be breakthroughs in this field if there's enough drive for research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

The discussion highlights the ongoing mystery and intrigue surrounding [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal activities and supernatural entities]], often blurring the lines between [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences]], personal belief, and the limits of scientific understanding.

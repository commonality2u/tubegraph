Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, describes bodybuilding as "probably the hardest sport in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, requiring immense dedication and sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Despite the difficulty, the journey has brought him immense satisfaction and a deep sense of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

## The Challenges of Professional Bodybuilding

### Unrewarding Aspects
Coleman states that bodybuilding is "not rewarding at all" in some respects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, particularly considering the prize money ($100,000 per Olympia win) versus the extreme demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Dietary Extremes
One of the most significant challenges for Coleman was the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. He emphasizes the necessity of eating vast amounts of food to gain size, noting that an "ordinary person could have done that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. His regimen included six meals a day, with a pound of chicken in every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. He often had to wake up in the middle of the night to eat, regardless of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. It took a "long time before my body got used to eating that much food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, eventually consuming 600 grams of protein daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

### Social Isolation
During his competitive years, Coleman experienced "real real dark times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, including significant social isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. His life revolved entirely around bodybuilding, meaning he couldn't go out to eat, go to movies, attend parties, or simply "hang out with friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This intensive focus was a 24/7, 365-day commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>, as he constantly had to prevent competitors from taking his title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Physical Demands & Injuries
Coleman's [[training_and_diet_for_bodybuilding_success | training regimen]] involved extremely heavy weights, including 800 lb squats and deadlifts, and 2300 lb leg presses for reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This intensity contributed to his "thick muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> and unique density, but also led to multiple surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. He has undergone 14 surgeries, including eight on his back, three on his hip, and three on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. He admits that he got "weaker after every last one of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a> physically.

### Steroid Use and Health Management
Coleman began using steroids at 30 years old, after much hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He received advice from Flex Wheeler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a> and prioritized safety by having everything "doctor prescribed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a> and undergoing checkups every four months to monitor his liver, kidneys, and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of medical guidance, stating that most people "don't understand about using steroids that you need a doctor to write you a whole plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. He noted that his health remained good because he "prioritized your health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a> and that his body always functioned properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.

## The Rewards of Bodybuilding Success

### The Thrill of Victory
Winning his first Mr. Olympia was "the most amazing thing that will ever happen to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. The overwhelming excitement caused him to black out for 10-15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. He now finds enjoyment in reflecting on his eight consecutive victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Respect and Recognition
Coleman's primary motivation to be a World Champion was to be "the best" and earn respect for his hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. He feels "extremely happy for the rest of my life" due to the unique gift he received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### Inner Invincibility
At his peak, Coleman admits he "did feel invincible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> during his heaviest lifts, believing there was "nothing I can't do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This powerful mindset contributed to his [[role_of_genetics_and_mentality_in_bodybuilding | competitive edge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Family Support
A crucial "reward" for Coleman has been the unwavering support of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. His entire family supported him, attending his first contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, traveling internationally to watch him compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, and even helping with fan mail and cooking his meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. His mother cooked all his six daily meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, highlighting the integral role of his family in his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | Mentality and Perseverance]]
Coleman attributes his success to his strong [[role_of_genetics_and_mentality_in_bodybuilding | mindset]], determination, focus, motivation, dedication, and ability to "persevere through just about anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. He visualizes his lifts, having already "done it a million times in my mind" before physically executing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. His time as a police officer also contributed to his strong mind, allowing him to rationalize difficult situations and maintain a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

### Humility and Acceptance
Despite his legendary status, Coleman remains incredibly humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He doesn't let criticism or injuries affect him, choosing to focus on his blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. He believes that "everything happens for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a> and that aging, though difficult, brings "gifts of Aging" like relaxation and family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. He always finds ways to be happy and joyous, even during challenging times, because he believes "everything's going to be all right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>.

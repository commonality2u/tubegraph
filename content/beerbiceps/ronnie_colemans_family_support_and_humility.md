Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, attributes much of his success and grounded nature to the unwavering support of his family and his inherent humility. His journey through bodybuilding, law enforcement, and life has been shaped by these core principles.

## The Foundation of Family Support

Ronnie Coleman emphasizes the profound role his family played throughout his career and life. He considers himself fortunate to have always had his family close by, preventing feelings of loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

Right from the beginning, his entire family, including his mother, brother, and sister, attended his very first contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This support continued as they would travel to other countries to watch him compete, including every Mr. Olympia competition he entered and won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

During his reign as Mr. Olympia, his family was instrumental in managing various aspects of his life:
*   His mother cooked all six of his daily meals, each containing a pound of chicken, ensuring his rigorous dietary needs were met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. He even had to wake up in the middle of the night to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.
*   His brother assisted with tasks like car maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   His sister helped with household chores, including cleaning and laundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   His family also helped him manage fan mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

Coleman notes that everyone in his family "had a job and they all helped out" through his entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This collective effort contributed significantly to his eight consecutive Mr. Olympia titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Even when he graduated college and moved to Texas from Louisiana, his entire family eventually followed, reinforcing their close-knit bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

Ronnie Coleman's mother instilled in him the lesson to "whatever you want to do, go out there and do it but do it joyfully and do it with some passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:00]</a>. This teaching seems to underpin his positive outlook on life and career, even during challenging times. He plans to offer the same 100% support to his own children if they choose to pursue bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:47:00">[55:47:00]</a>.

## An Embodiment of Humility

Despite his unparalleled success and worldwide fame, Ronnie Coleman maintains a remarkably humble and even-keeled demeanor. He expresses how "even killed and so humble" he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, striving not to let his achievements "get to my head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

His humility is evident in several aspects of his life:
*   **Fame and Recognition:** When asked about being loved in India, he acknowledges it but quickly brings it back to his humble nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. He doesn't read or hear about critics and their negative comments, stating they "don't affect me at all" because he's been a positive person his "whole entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>. He considers himself "one of the luckiest guys in the whole wide world" because God gave him a unique gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.
*   **Early Career Motivation:** He initially got into bodybuilding just for a free gym membership, never aiming to win the Olympia title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. He admits he was often overlooked early in his career because he turned pro quickly and in another country, without the "fan fair" of U.S.-based pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Perception of His Body:** He states he is "not a mirror person" and "never ever done that" (flexed or looked in the mirror to admire his physique). He always relied on others to tell him how he looked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:00">[48:17:00]</a>. He didn't even notice the changes from steroids until he saw himself in a magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:09:00">[48:09:00]</a>. Even at his peak, he describes his massive size as "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Perspective on Difficult Experiences:** His past experience as a police officer contributed to his humility. He witnessed "crazy stuff" like murders, suicides, and domestic violence, which he rationalized by believing "things happen for a reason" and that violence is "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>. He explicitly states his humility comes from this exposure to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a>.
*   **Absence of Arrogance:** Coleman asserts he never had a phase of becoming arrogant, maintaining an "open" mind to everything that happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. He believes "bad things are going to happen to good people, bad things going to happen to bad people," seeing it as the "cycle of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>.
*   **Acceptance and Forward Movement:** The end of his Mr. Olympia winning streak took him only "a couple hours" to process, shifting from sadness and disbelief to acceptance that "everything comes to an end" and it was "time to move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. He doesn't objectively analyze what went wrong, simply believing "everything happens for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. He embraces aging as a time to relax and enjoy life's benefits, like spending time with family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.
*   **Joyful Disposition:** He describes himself as "a happy guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a> and "a positive person my whole entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>. He maintains there's "no sadness in my heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>, viewing happiness as a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. Even when working menial jobs like delivering pizzas after college, he found ways to be happy and joyous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>.

> "I've always been even killed about just about everything you know like I said my faith has taught me that bad things are going to happen uh to good people bad things going to happen to bad people uh it's just evident it's just cycle of living pretty much you know and ain't nothing I can do to stop it it just just just just part of life for the most part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>

The [[the_evolution_of_stardom_and_bollywood_industry_changes | Indian film industry]] is undergoing a rapid transformation, with significant differences between its state pre-pandemic and today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This shift impacts everything from how films are made and financed to how they are received by audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Rapid Transformation
The industry has seen a profound change in its fundamental operations and audience engagement since the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This includes adjustments in film production, financing models, and the way audiences consume and react to content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Impact on Stars and Artists
Upcoming stars and artists, such as [[challenges_and_perceptions_of_nepotism_in_the_film_industry | Janhvi Kapoor]], often find it challenging to express their true selves in traditional public forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. They are frequently asked the same repetitive questions, limiting their ability to truly speak their heart out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Role of Podcasts
Podcasts have emerged as a significant platform, offering a space for artists to open up authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For instance, [[challenges_and_perceptions_of_nepotism_in_the_film_industry | Janhvi Kapoor]] opened up extensively on [[growth_and_impact_of_the_ranveer_show_in_india | The Ranveer Show]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The podcast is also noted for its personal approach to content creation, which is described as refreshing in a commercialized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Evolving Audience Preferences
There's a growing demand for dark and twisted content globally, and the Indian film industry is also looking to pivot in this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This shift is partly driven by a generational change in audience attention spans, particularly among Gen Z (born after 2000), who require very gripping content to stay engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. Short-form content like reels and shorts can strengthen the brain's tendency to exhibit characteristics similar to clinically diagnosed ADHD, or weaken the ability to maintain attention for longer than 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. This influences the success of shows like Euphoria, which feature constant camera movement and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

The pandemic has also influenced a widespread realignment of personal and professional priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

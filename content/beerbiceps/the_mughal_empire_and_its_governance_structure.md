Before the formation of [[the_socioeconomic_conditions_of_india_before_shivajis_empire | Shivaji Maharaj's Empire]], the Mughal Empire dominated a significant portion of India, particularly the North, encompassing 22 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:51">[03:32:51]</a>. Understanding the [[cultural_and_systemic_challenges_in_indian_governance | governance]] and nature of the Mughal rule is crucial to grasp the historical context of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

## Administrative Structure

The Mughal Empire's administration relied heavily on a decentralized system where land was granted to warriors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### Jagirdars and Mansabdars
*   **Jagirdar**: A warrior granted land by the King or Sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Their responsibilities included being in charge of cultivators, collecting taxes from them, and maintaining a cavalry force for the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This system effectively outsourced the army, as it was not directly under the king's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Mansabdar**: A warrior to whom land is granted, responsible for looking after cultivators, collecting taxes (as agriculture was the primary industry), and maintaining cavalry for the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Approximately 80% of the Mughal Empire's land was granted to mansabdars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. These mansabdars often lived like "mini-kings," exerting significant power and control over their regions, which impacted the justice received by common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

### Imperial Hierarchy
While the Mughal emperor held ultimate authority, regional rulers like Adil Shah, Qutb Shah, and Najam Shah were considered kings, not emperors, and were vassals who paid tribute to the Mughal Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. The emperor alone was allowed to use specific symbols like the sun, moon, fish, or swastika <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. Akbar, for instance, sought to dissolve these southern kingdoms into the empire rather than just having them as vassals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>.

## Wealth and Military Power

The Mughal Empire was one of the largest and richest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue**: The empire collected vast sums, approximately 1.20 crore rupees in silver coins, which was equivalent to 93,000 kilograms of gold or roughly $3.5 billion in modern value, primarily extracted from cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. About 20% of this revenue went directly into the emperor's coffers, with the rest used by mansabdars to maintain their cavalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.
*   **Military Force**: The Mughal army was formidable, numbering half a million people, including 200,000 heavy-duty cavalry, 40,000 artillerymen, and 100,000 foot soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.
    *   **Composition**: Soldiers came from various regions, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkomans, and Russians from the Volga region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. Indian Hindus, Rajputs, and Marathas also served in the Mughal army, though they often faced racial discrimination, being paid less than lighter-skinned foreign soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>.
    *   **Equipment**: The army was equipped with javelins, heavy-duty swords, shields, and lightweight cannons (trained by the Portuguese) that could be moved quickly on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. They also used expert artillerymen skilled in firing cannonballs and explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.
    *   **Tactics**: During battles for succession, emperors like Shah Jahan employed elephants given "post" (opium seeds) to make them wild, tying chains with spiked iron balls to their trunks to create chaos in enemy ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## Nature of Mughal Rule and Succession

The period from the 12th century until [[the_socioeconomic_conditions_of_india_before_shivajis_empire | Shivaji Maharaj's birth]] in the 17th century was marked by significant fear and suffering for the average Indian, especially in the North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. Terms like "Sultani Calamity" (raiders) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disaster) were common, reflecting the vulnerability and insecurity of the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>. People were often killed, and women and children were taken as chattel property or sex slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

### Succession Struggles and Cruelty
A defining characteristic of the Mughal dynasty was the brutal [[conflict_and_politics_during_the_time_of_aurangzeb_and_shivaji | power struggle]] for the throne. There was no rule that the first son would become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Instead, it was a ruthless "throne or the grave" scenario, where brothers and kinsmen killed each other to seize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

*   **Salim (Jahangir)**: Extremely cruel, he tortured and blinded his own handsome and secular son, Khusrau, who was favored by Akbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Salt water was poured into the eye sockets for excruciating pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Khusrau was later killed by Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Shah Jahan**: Killed 36 individuals, including Khusrau, to secure the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **[[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]**: A master of military tactics and a shrewd politician, [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]] skillfully used [[hindu_muslim_relations_and_indian_political_history | religion]] to his advantage to gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. He imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, and eliminated his brothers Dara Shikoh, Murad, and Shah Shuja through various means, including poisoning (opium seeds), execution, and driving them into dangerous territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. Even his own son, Muhammad Sultan, died of depression after being imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

### Portrayal in History and Media
While films often romanticize historical figures like Akbar, historical accounts suggest they were often cruel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Akbar, for instance, killed subordinates to take their women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This selective portrayal, often hiding negative aspects, leads to a skewed understanding of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Many historical characters are morally "grey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

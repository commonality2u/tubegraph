In the Indian context, a Yuga is broadly defined as a "period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. However, there are multiple definitions and interpretations of Yugas within [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Indian texts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. One researcher, Arun Upadhyay, has collected over 26 different definitions of a Yuga, to which the speaker has added more than 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Interpretations of Yugas

### Yugas Based on Action (Acharana Brahman)
One interpretation, found in a Brahman text connected to the [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Rigveda]], defines Yugas based on one's actions and state of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>:
*   **Kaliyuga:** When one is sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   **Dwapara Yuga:** When one wakes up and sits up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
*   **Treta Yuga:** When one stands up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Satya Yuga:** When one gets into action and starts walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
    *   This definition suggests staying in the Satya Yuga by continuously walking and taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. This interpretation has no direct relation to chronological time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

### Yugas Based on Emotional State
Another understanding relates Yugas to subjective emotional states, similar to Einstein's theory of relativity concerning the perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. For example, the great Saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stated that a moment of separation from Govinda (Krishna) can feel like a Yuga, illustrating an emotional state's impact on time perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

### Mathematical/Astronomical Formulations
A common misconception associates specific, very long durations with Yugas (e.g., 432,000 years for Kali Yuga, doubled for Dwapara, tripled for Treta, four times for Satya Yuga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. These figures, however, "have absolutely nothing to do with the chronological yugas of [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Ramayana]] and [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Instead, they relate to mathematical computation formulations in [[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | astronomy]] used to determine "absolutely precise and accurate orbital periods of planets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

### Calendrical Yuga (Panchanga Yuga)
A calendrical Yuga, also known as the Panchanga Yuga, is a period of five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. This was utilized in conjunction with [[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | astronomical evidence]] to discuss specific time periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

## Chronological Dating of Epics and Yugas

Based on the speaker's research and [[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | astronomical evidence]], the major Indian epics are dated as follows:
*   [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]] War: More than 7,000 years ago, specifically 5561 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Ramayana]]: More than 14,000 years ago, specifically 12,209 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Rigveda]]: More than 21,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

A curious observation notes that the current time is roughly 7,000 years from the [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]], and the [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]] was roughly 7,000 years from the [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This "multiplication of seven" or "mystical cycle of 7,000 years" is noted as a fascinating numerological pattern, but the speaker does not read further into its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

The speaker also notes that the passing of Krishna marked the beginning of the Kali Yuga, the [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]] occurred in the Dwapara Yuga, and the [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Ramayana]] in the Treta Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## Kalachakra and Yuga Transformation

The [[Significance and mythology of Yadava and Pandava clans | Mahabharata]] provides a definition related to *Kalachakra* (the wheel of time), stating: "**Raja Kalasya Karanam**" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. This means that a specific type of Yuga emerges based on how a king or administrator governs the kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. Extending this, the speaker proposes "**Praja Kalasya Karanam**," suggesting that when the populace develops civic sense, a different Yuga can also arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

Anand Ranganathan, a respected political commentator, discusses the pervasive issue of corruption in [[indias_political_landscape | modern-day India]], attributing it primarily to "missed opportunities" stemming from political expediency and self-serving strategies rather than a genuine focus on national progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Government Businesses and Corruption
Ranganathan argues that the government's involvement in running businesses is a major source of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He quotes Prime Minister Modi's past statement, "a government has no business to be in business," a principle that has not been upheld by the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. The government has continued to be involved in running businesses, including public sector units (PSUs), rather than focusing on taxation of private enterprises to fund welfare initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### Issues with Public Sector Units (PSUs)
India has approximately 1,830 public sector units (central and state), with about 400 of them being non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. These PSUs are often characterized by:
*   Lack of ability to dismiss non-contributing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   Non-competitiveness, leading to reliance on government funding rather than market performance (e.g., Doordarshan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   Continued existence of outdated or obsolete operations, such as a PSU funded to make chlorofluorocarbons (banned in the late 1980s) until as late as two years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

This system enables corruption and fosters an environment where individuals can earn money without contributing or being profit-making, which Ranganathan describes as the "antithesis of Darwinian Evolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## Political Expediency and Freebies
The primary intention behind the government's continued involvement in businesses and distribution of "freebies" is to win elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Freebies include initiatives like free electricity, free water, and free trips for senior citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. While India, as a welfare state, needs to provide essential services like food, education, and health insurance, the money for these initiatives should be generated through capitalism (taxing private businesses) rather than government-run enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

An example of political expediency is the reversal to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) in states like Himachal Pradesh by the Congress party, despite expert advice against it, purely to appease a specific vote bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This decision, while winning elections, is considered disastrous for future generations and state finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This highlights the "dark truth" of political careers: decisions are often made to gain power, even if they are detrimental to the country in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

## Hindrance to India's Progress
Ranganathan laments the "missed opportunities" for India to "leapfrog" into a middle-income economy due to political decisions. He highlights the example of the Farm Bills, which would have transformed India's agricultural sector by:
1.  Allowing farmers to sell produce anywhere, not just government *mandis* (APMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
2.  Abolishing the Essential Commodities Act, which prevented farmers from storing produce and forced immediate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
3.  Introducing contract farming between businesses and farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

These reforms, paradoxically present in the manifestos of opposition parties, were repealed by the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] due to protests, a decision Ranganathan calls "anti-national" as it severely hampered India's economic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. He believes a farmer, like any other businessperson, should have the freedom to sell their produce wherever they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Criticisms of PM Modi and BJP
Ranganathan, despite being perceived by some as right-wing, offers specific criticisms of the [[modi_governments_policies | Modi government]] and BJP:
*   **Economic Policies**: He describes the Modi *sarcar* as "communist" in terms of economic outlook, advocating for more state control and minimal reforms, which is contrary to Modi's earlier statements about government not being in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Corruption**: He cites instances of corruption within the BJP, openly challenging the narrative that the party is not corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Farm Bill Repeal**: He considers the repeal of the farm laws a "spectacular failure" that was not adequately explained to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>.
*   **Failure to Dispel False Narratives**: Ranganathan criticizes the BJP for not actively dispelling false narratives, such as the perception of being anti-Muslim or anti-Christian, because it serves their "vote bank" interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>.

## The Role of Honesty in Politics
Ranganathan believes that while politicians should admit their mistakes, the concept of an "honest politician" is almost an oxymoron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>. He gives the example of Arvind Kejriwal, who has apologized "hundreds of times" but is perceived as insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. He suggests that if a reasonably honest politician were to show genuine remorse, they might gain public trust, but this is a master strategy yet to be truly attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:23">[01:49:23]</a>. He highlights that in [[indias_political_landscape | Indian politics]], actions are often dictated by the need to win elections and secure vote banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.

When following a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet|ketogenic diet]], it is crucial to continually adjust caloric intake to ensure progress towards fitness goals, particularly fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The diet plan is not fixed; calories must be progressively reduced in subsequent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Initial Phase of Keto

Initially, during the [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet|ketogenic diet]], there's some flexibility regarding fat intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It's acceptable to consume "super greasy food" as long as the total daily carbohydrate intake remains below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Later Stages and Fat Reduction

To ensure continued fat loss and achieve a [[understanding_the_caloric_deficit_principle|caloric deficit]], it becomes necessary to reduce fat intake as the diet progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The goal is to stay below maintenance calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The example [[meal_planning_for_ketogenic_diet|diet plan]] provided is representative of the "end of Keto," when calories are intentionally kept very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. At this stage, while some oily food is acceptable, it should not be "extra greasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Calorie Consideration in Meal Choices

Specific food choices should reflect the need for calorie management:

*   **Protein Shakes**: Using an isolate protein supplement mixed with water is recommended over milk, as isolates are lower in carbohydrates and calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Eggs**: When preparing meals like an omelette, it's important not to overdo the added oil, as egg yolks themselves contribute significant fat. Excessive oil could lead to exceeding maintenance calories and hindering fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Red Meat**: While red meat can be consumed on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet|ketogenic diet]] due to its fat content, it should not be eaten daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. However, it can be included as a late-night meal, particularly when extra fat intake is permissible within the diet's framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Takeaway
> The principle of [[understanding_the_caloric_deficit_principle|caloric deficit]] is paramount for fat loss on keto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While the diet allows for higher fat initially, strategic fat reduction and careful calorie counting become necessary to continue seeing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

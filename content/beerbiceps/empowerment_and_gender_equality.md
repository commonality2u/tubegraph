Priyanka Chopra Jonas discusses the evolution of societal expectations for women, advocating for personal empowerment and challenging traditional gender roles. She emphasizes the importance of making self-defined choices and creating a legacy for future generations.

## Challenging Traditional Molds
The current generation of girls is characterized as fearless, actively taking charge of their lives and refusing to conform to the "cookie-cutter mold" that previous generations, such as their mothers or grandmothers, might have had to fit into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Many young women have significantly altered their family's trajectory through their independent choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The Influence of Past Generations
Priyanka Chopra acknowledges that her generation of women played a crucial role in changing the trajectory for subsequent generations. Female co-actors fought for lead roles and agency in films, which were not readily available to women before them, thereby "opening the doors" for those who came after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Redefining Success and Agency
Chopra emphasizes that her choices are now her own and are not defined by the need for validation from others, a stark contrast to her younger self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. She reflects on the privilege of having agency in her own life, noting that many women globally do not have the freedom to make their own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Her parents instilled in her the importance of having an opinion, which she considers a significant blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Battling Gendered Narratives and Expectations
Chopra speaks out against societal narratives that dictate how women should behave. She recalls being taught in school that "women should be seen not heard," and receiving instructions on how to sit or the length of their skirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. She passionately states that "Good Girls Don't Make History," advocating instead for "Bold Girls" who make history by taking choices that may be contrary to what they've been told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. True [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | empowerment]] comes from within, from one's own "gut," especially if external encouragement is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Gender Disparity in the Entertainment Industry
Chopra highlights the persistent issue of gender bias in the film industry:
*   **Ageism:** She recounts her mother's advice at age 30 that her "shelf life" in Bollywood was over, as older male actors preferred working with younger women. This reflects an industry that tells women they are "too old" when they reach their thirties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Pay Parity:** Despite decades of work, Chopra only received the same remuneration as her male co-actors in a Hollywood film in 2020, after 21 years in the industry. She notes that in Bollywood, she never received equal pay, even if her role was as significant as a man's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
*   **Gendered Labeling of Films:** Chopra argues that calling films "female-led films" while male-led films are simply referred to by their title perpetuates an unnecessary distinction. She calls for a change in vocabulary, questioning why terms like "female athlete" or "female politician" are still used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Supporting Women Through Innovation
Chopra's involvement with Bumble, bringing it to India, was driven by the platform's mission to create a safe space where women could take the first step in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. She recognized its particular importance in India due to safety concerns for girls, and is proud that the app is now used in even tier three and four cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Legacy and Purpose
Chopra views her career not just as personal success, but as a legacy for her children and future generations, demonstrating the potential for women to achieve what was once unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. She believes the meaning of life is defined by one's purpose and the legacy created between birth and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

Praveen Mohan, a highly requested guest since 2019, dedicates his time to exploring [[preservation_and_exploration_of_archaeological_sites_in_india | ancient sites]] in India and globally, aiming to uncover forgotten truths about the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. He documents his findings, sharing about 10% on his YouTube channel, which has captivated a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Mohan is an engineer and YouTuber with a strong fascination for [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Challenging Mainstream Historical Narratives

Praveen Mohan highlights that history, as taught in the Indian education system, often feels confined to discoveries made in the 1980s or early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. He suggests that current history books, many written 100-200 years ago, contain a calculated bias and misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. With increasing globalization and the spread of information via social media, it's becoming evident that many historical accounts are "full of misinformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

A key point of contention is the concept of technological and architectural evolution. In modern times, structures like the Eiffel Tower, CN Tower, and Burj Khalifa show a clear progression of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. However, this evolutionary pattern is not consistently observed in [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | ancient Indian structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>:
*   **Ajanta Caves**: Both the largest and the oldest cave temple structure in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.
*   **Kallanai Dam**: The largest and oldest ancient dam in India, dating back 2,000 years, capable of changing the flow of a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.
*   **Kailasa Temple**: Carved from a single mountain 1,300 years ago, starting from the Mountaintop and scooping out rocks, leaving the temple as what remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. It features bridges, chambers, and pillars, all from one stone, without metal or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

These structures do not show a progression from smaller, less complex designs to larger, more advanced ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. This suggests either a lost period of building or that advanced technologies were suddenly present and then disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.

## Advanced Technologies in Temple Construction

Archaeologists and historians often claim [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | ancient Indian temples]] were built with primitive tools like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>. However, Praveen Mohan presents evidence of advanced technology:

*   **Lathe Machines**: Pillars in temples like Hoysaleswara Temple and Chennakesava Temple in Karnataka were made using lathe machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. These machines create perfectly circular shapes, leaving visible turn marks similar to those seen on a potter's wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. For pillars weighing 20 tons, a lathe machine of 300-400 meters long would have been required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>. Archaeologists are reportedly embarrassed to admit this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. The knowledge of these massive lathe machines disappeared without continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>.
*   **Hollow Stone Skulls**: A "dwarpalika" (doorkeeper) sculpture in a dark temple features a crown studded with stone skulls, each about 1 inch wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. These skulls are completely hollow, with threads able to pass through the ears, eyes, and mouth, indicating impossible precision for primitive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.
*   **Earthquake-Proofing (Ramappa Temple)**: The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, recently recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, is built with lightweight bricks that float in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. This technology, similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), was used 800-900 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. This allowed the temple to withstand a massive earthquake that destroyed all other nearby buildings, demonstrating an early form of earthquake-proof technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. The builders likely predicted earthquakes in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>.

## Temples as Repositories of Knowledge

Temples were not merely places of worship but served as "Wikipedia in stone" or "town museums in stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:27">[1:25:27]</a>. Their stone carvings ensured the longevity of knowledge, unlike fragile mediums like leaves or paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:35">[1:25:35]</a>.

Temples were designed with different levels of information catering to various age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:09">[1:20:09]</a>:
*   **Ages 0-5**: The lowest level depicts animals, like baby elephants drinking milk or monkeys riding goats, acting as an ancient "Animal Planet" or "Discovery Channel" for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:18">[1:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:51">[1:20:51]</a>.
*   **Ages 6-10**: This level showcases music and dance carvings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:23">[1:21:23]</a>.
*   **Ages 11-15**: Features science and technology, including a sun dial in Konark Temple that can tell time down to the minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:42">[1:21:42]</a>.
*   **Ages 16-20**: Depicts war, administration, politics, and wrestling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:16">[1:22:16]</a>.
*   **Ages 21-25**: This level contains erotica and depictions of love-making, reflecting the ancient Indian society's liberal approach to these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:34">[1:22:34]</a>. It also includes carvings showing women giving birth while standing, a practice now recommended for its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:23:18">[1:23:18]</a>, and post-birth disinfecting practices using fire and herbs, observed in tribes like the Bond tribe in Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:06">[1:24:06]</a>.

Only above these levels are the Gods depicted, signifying a structured educational journey within the temple itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:15">[1:25:15]</a>.

## Global Parallels and Controversial Theories

Praveen Mohan notes striking similarities between [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Hindu sites]] and those in Peru, Colombia, Cambodia, and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. For instance, in Peru, popular gods are Nagas, and a Shivling guarded by a Naga is found in San Agust√≠n, Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>.

A fascinating theory revolves around **Nagas**:
*   In [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Hindu texts]] like the Mahabharata, Nagas are not merely snakes but shapeshifting humanoids who lived in subterranean levels (Patala Loka) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:44:00">[50:44:00]</a>.
*   Carvings in Mahabalipuram show Nagas transforming from snake-like forms to humans emerging from underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a>.
*   Mohan suggests that in modern terms, Nagas could be "reptilians" or an "alien species" capable of changing form and residing in a different dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>.
*   The term "Naga" has linguistic parallels globally: "Amaru" in Peru, "Nakash" in Israel, and "Saraf" (Serpents) in the Bible, similar to the Sanskrit "Sarpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:42:00">[59:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:43">[1:00:43]</a>.
*   Across ancient civilizations, a common story suggests that the very first rulers were Naga Kings/Queens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:38">[1:01:38]</a>. The first ruler of Cambodia, Soma, a Naga woman, married a human, Kaundinya, founding the civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:46">[1:12:46]</a>.
*   Nagas are consistently carved in all [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | Hindu temples]] and ancient structures worldwide, leading to the theory that they are the oldest and most fundamental "gods" or beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:45">[1:15:45]</a>.

Mohan also points to the discovery of extinct animals carved into ancient temples:
*   At Ta Prohm Temple in Cambodia (an ancient [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | Hindu site]]), a carving accurately depicts a Stegosaurus, an animal believed to be extinct for 65 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>.
*   In Angkor Wat, an elephant with four tusks is carved, a species thought to have become extinct 100,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:39:00">[48:39:00]</a>. These carvings raise questions about how ancient sculptors could have depicted these animals accurately without direct observation or comprehensive records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08:00">[49:08:00]</a>.

He also mentions local villagers' stories of short beings from the sky civilizing humans and teaching them construction technology in places like Koodal Kava in Tamil Nadu and Kote Bano in Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:34">[1:04:34]</a>. These beings, feared at first, vanished after building magnificent structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:02">[1:05:02]</a>. Mohan links these accounts to the Naga figures found in nearby temples, suggesting they represent these "alien species" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:24">[1:06:24]</a>.

Mohan faces challenges with platforms like YouTube demonetizing or banning his videos, citing "nudity" or "violence" in [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | Hindu temple]] carvings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>. He argues this is a form of censorship, as similar nude Greek sculptures in museums are not banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:04:00">[57:04:00]</a>. He views this as a "calculated plan" to prevent people from understanding the "true nature of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Praveen Mohan encourages critical thinking about history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:01">[1:27:01]</a>. He believes there are serious gaps in conventional history and archaeology books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:24">[1:27:24]</a>. His message is to remain open to the wonders of the world and history, as humanity may not be the most advanced civilization, and more advanced civilizations may have existed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:38">[1:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:00">[1:28:00]</a>. He emphasizes that uncovering these hidden truths can help advance modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:42">[1:28:42]</a>.

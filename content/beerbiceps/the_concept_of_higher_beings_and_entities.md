Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader, posits that [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | higher beings]] and other entities exist in the earthly realm, a concept he states as knowledge rather than belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11]">[00:36:11]</a>. He emphasizes that assuming only human beings exist on Earth is a limited way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25]">[00:36:25]</a>. Just as air exists though unseen, so do these other beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30]">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Types of Beings

### Higher Beings
These entities are described as being present around us, sometimes encouraging and helping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48]">[00:36:48]</a>. Their frequency of vibration is different from humans, meaning we generally don't feel or perceive them, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05]">[00:41:05]</a>. Some, but not all, of these beings can perceive humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22]">[00:41:22]</a>. For spiritual seekers, it's advised not to get "stuck" with these beings, but to continue on the path to absolute freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55]">[00:40:55]</a>.

Angels (or 'Farish' in some traditions) are categorized as [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | good higher beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09]">[00:42:09]</a>. They are not merely "God's soldiers" as depicted in Semitic narratives, but beings belonging to a different dimension, distinct from human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13]">[00:42:13]</a>. There are many species of such beings on Earth, interpenetrating this world, and some even originate from other realms or universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30]">[00:42:30]</a>.

### Ghosts
Shri M suggests that what people typically refer to as "ghosts" are often products of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09]">[00:38:09]</a>. He explains that when a person dies suddenly, the electric charges that have acquired a certain shape within the body are released and can wander around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32]">[00:38:32]</a>. These charges may temporarily be visible and retain the human form, but they lack intelligence and cannot cause physical harm, only fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12]">[00:39:12]</a>. Over time, these charges dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06]">[00:39:06]</a>. The soul is separate and departs at the moment of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29]">[00:39:29]</a>.

### Demonic Entities and Possession
While 90% of perceived possessions are psychological diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37]">[00:39:37]</a>, Shri M acknowledges rare cases where other beings can occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53]">[00:39:53]</a>. These are not necessarily ghosts or explicitly "demonic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00]">[00:40:00]</a>; some can even be good entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03]">[00:40:03]</a>.

Certain non-physical beings might influence humans by increasing desires, which can be a "dangerous thing" for a spiritual practitioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39]">[00:44:39]</a>. For example, some beings thrive on and encourage sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01]">[00:45:01]</a>. These "naughty elements" can infuse thoughts into the human mind, often dismissed as one's own thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28]">[00:45:28]</a>.

### Yetis
Shri M recounted a personal experience in the Himalayas where he encountered a "furry kind of person" which his Guru later identified as a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07]">[01:20:07]</a>. This Yeti provided him with a herbal medicine, which his Guru stated saved him from a potentially fatal mountain fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26]">[01:21:26]</a>. His Guru affirmed that Yetis are "good people," not to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20]">[01:21:20]</a>. This experience solidified his understanding that such living creatures exist in remote mountain and forest areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35]">[01:22:35]</a>.

### Nagas
Nagas, specifically the hooded serpents like cobras, are discussed as "decadent leftovers" of a species of beings that once lived in another realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02]">[01:24:02]</a>. In ancient times, these original Nagas were teachers to humans and are symbolized as wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15]">[01:24:15]</a>. They were recalled to their realm, called Nagaloka, because they began having relationships with human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59]">[01:24:59]</a>. While the current cobras are not as intelligent as their forefathers, they are more intelligent than common snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20]">[01:25:20]</a>. Cobras are said to only bite if threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41]">[01:25:41]</a> and can recognize individuals in whom the Kundalini (also symbolically linked to the Naga) is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09]">[01:26:09]</a>.

## Interaction and Protection

To interact with or protect oneself from these beings, especially negative influences, one should invoke positive forces. For instance, chanting mantras like "Gurur Brahma Gurur Vishnu..." can invite helpful [[the_influence_of_higher_and_lower_beings_in_the_earthly_realm | higher beings]] to influence minds and free them from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50]">[00:43:50]</a>. In cases of negative influence, invoking positive energies can negate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12]">[00:44:12]</a>.

During meditation, it's traditional to draw a "mind circle" or protective barrier to keep away external thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39]">[00:46:39]</a>. Similarly, the grotesque figures (Dwarapalas) at temple gates are believed to ward off evil influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51]">[00:46:51]</a>.

Shri M's Guru taught him about the existence of these beings not as a matter of [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | belief]], but as facts that are important to know. Understanding them, whether for help or avoidance, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22]">[00:43:22]</a>.

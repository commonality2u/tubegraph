Sarvesh Shashi, a prominent young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success and personal growth to his nine-year practice of celibacy, which includes the [[nofap_movement_and_its_psychological_impact | NoFap]] rule and abstaining from sex [00:00:08]. He believes this practice has granted him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams [00:00:16].

## Sarvesh Shashi's Journey into Celibacy
Sarvesh's [[sarvesh_shashis_journey_with_celibacy_and_nofap | journey with celibacy]] began at age 18, after his father encouraged him to complete a yoga class [00:04:04]. His teacher introduced him to the concept of *sadas* (disciplines) [00:05:28], which involved commitments like being silent for 40 days or meditating for nine hours daily [00:05:53]. Completing these sadas consistently led to personal advancements, such as becoming captain of his college cricket team during a challenging year [00:06:47].

His teacher then introduced five precepts, which Sarvesh committed to follow:
1.  **No intoxicants and non-vegetarian food** [00:08:08]
2.  **Non-violence** (through actions, thoughts, and words) [00:08:08]
3.  **No mental or physical stealing** [00:08:38]
4.  **No lying** (even white lies) [00:08:08]
5.  **Celibacy** (no sex, no masturbation, no ejaculation) [00:08:08]

While initially only committing for 40 days, his teacher revealed the celibacy commitment was for seven years [00:08:43]. Despite the initial difficulty, especially at his age and with social accessibility [00:08:07], Sarvesh continued. After about a year and a half, at 19-and-a-half, it became a way of life [00:09:39]. He has not broken any of the five precepts since he started [00:09:46].

## Benefits of Semen Retention and NoFap

### Enhanced Energy and Creativity
Sarvesh emphasizes that [[semen_composition_and_its_role_in_mental_clarity | semen retention]] involves channeling energy upwards to the brain instead of releasing it [00:11:55]. This process opens up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process" and activates the right brain [00:12:06]. He notes that this creative energy benefits his profession, cricket performance (watching the ball, bowling, overall performance) [00:12:43], and even simple tasks like being confident in front of people [00:13:27].

### Increased Stamina and Performance
Sarvesh directly links semen retention to higher stamina and feeling more energetic [00:11:49]. He states that [[mens_sexual_health_and_performance_anxiety | semen retention]] is "hugely also linked to Performance," leading to a peak performance level [00:12:50]. The common observation of tiredness after ejaculation highlights the energy drain that retention aims to prevent [00:13:47].

### Magnetic Attraction and Changed Perception
Sarvesh has been told that semen retention makes a person more attractive, perhaps due to an energetic magnetism rather than purely physical changes [00:20:47]. He observes that women often feel drawn to and safe around him, attributing it to a sense of trust [00:20:00] and his own internal energy [00:20:24].

He also notes a significant shift in his definition of attraction [00:21:35]. When practicing semen retention, one tends to look beyond superficial physical attributes [00:21:40]. Instead of immediate sexual thoughts, the practice encourages questions about compassion, love, and empathy for another person [00:23:04]. The focus shifts from fleeting physical pleasure to a deeper, more profound connection or understanding of the individual [00:23:51].

### Enhanced Intuition and Focus
Sarvesh's spiritual practices, including [[the_benefits_of_semen_retention_and_celibacy | celibacy]], have significantly increased his intuition, or "Sixth Sense" [00:34:52]. This allows him to sense things before they happen, understand a person's vibe, or know the right action at a crossroads [00:34:15]. He shares instances where his non-lying precept led to events unfolding as he spoke them, such as a friend's dress burning or another friend receiving a visa on the exact date he predicted [00:31:06]. While he doesn't consciously use intuition for career, it automatically manifests in daily life [00:35:22].

The practice of focusing on the natural breath (Anapana) in meditation helps keep one in the present moment [00:39:35]. This meditation technique trains the mind to observe thoughts without getting involved, increasing one's focus levels in waking life [00:40:07].

### Practical Advice for NoFap
For those starting [[nofap_movement_and_its_psychological_impact | NoFap]], a simple yoga exercise is suggested to manage lustful feelings [00:14:53]:
1.  Sit calmly.
2.  Take a deep breath in.
3.  Visualize the energy flowing from the sex organs upwards to the spine and into the brain [00:15:17].
4.  Breathe out and imagine that energy spreading through the brain [00:15:24].

This visualization helps channel sexual energy into creative energy [00:16:13]. While initial cravings can be difficult, consistent practice makes it easier to overcome them [00:16:32].

### Broader Life Learnings
Sarvesh shares three key life learnings that complement the [[the_benefits_of_semen_retention_and_celibacy | benefits of semen retention]] and his yogic lifestyle:
1.  **Authenticity and Truth:** Be true and authentic to yourself, even when it's difficult [00:41:17].
2.  **Self-Care:** Prioritize both physical and mental self-care [00:41:53]. This includes practices like gym and yoga, functional training, and mindful breathing to believe in yourself and improve daily [00:42:37].
3.  **Being a People Person:** Effective people management is crucial for success, whether as an entrepreneur or an employee [00:43:09]. Employees often leave employers, not companies, emphasizing the importance of being a good leader [00:43:29].

Sarvesh's own experience of profound personal changes motivated him to spread the message of self-care and these practices, leading to the formation of his yoga company [00:44:01]. These collective practices, he believes, lead to becoming a more compassionate person [00:44:16].

The way history is taught and presented in India has become a significant point of contention, particularly among younger generations. Many feel that the current education system has provided an incomplete, biased, and often irrelevant account of the past, leading to a widespread desire for a more truthful and comprehensive understanding of historical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>.

## Biased Historical Narratives

There is a growing dissatisfaction with the existing historical narratives, which are often criticized for being selective and promoting a particular viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>.

### Delhi-Centric Focus
A major critique is that Indian history textbooks are excessively "Delhi-centric," disproportionately focusing on dynasties and events in and around Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. For instance, NCERT books feature three chapters on the Mughal dynasty and numerous references to obscure Delhi dynasties like the Lodis, Khaljis, and Tughlaqs, whose contributions to the nation are deemed minimal apart from some architectural structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. In contrast, powerful and long-ruling empires like the Cholas (who ruled for a thousand years), the Vijayanagara Empire, and various other dynasties such as the Shahans, Rashtrakutas, Palas, Kadambas, Gangas, Chalukyas, and Wodeyars, receive little to no attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. The history of Northeast India, including the Ahom rulers who governed for 600 years, is almost entirely neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This selective focus creates a distorted view, making it seem as though India has been a nation of "losers" rather than acknowledging periods of valor and courage that allowed the civilization to persist as the only pre-Bronze Era civilization still in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Linear View of the Freedom Struggle
The portrayal of the Indian Freedom Movement is often described as linear, simplistic, and monochromatic, emphasizing only the non-violent, mass movement led by Gandhi and the Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This narrative frequently overlooks the significant role of armed resistance, which formed an "unending chain" from the 1857 Uprising all the way to the 1946 Naval Mutiny in Bombay (Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The 1857 Uprising was initially called the "sepoy mutiny" by the British in a disparaging manner, a term later challenged by V. D. Savarkar, who referred to it as the "first war of Indian independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Similarly, the 1946 Naval Mutiny, which many argue should be called the "last war of Indian independence," is still referred to as a "mutiny" against perceived rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

The role of revolutionaries and their sacrifices, such as those made by the Indian National Army (INA) under Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, which inspired widespread mutinies in the British Indian army and navy, is often minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Prime Minister Clement Attlee of Britain, in 1952 or 1953, reportedly stated that the heroics of the INA and the subsequent naval mutinies were the primary reasons for Britain's swift departure from India, while the impact of the non-violent Quit India Movement was "minimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

### Disparaging Terminology
Even decades after independence, some Delhi University textbooks continue to use terms like "revolutionary terrorist" for figures such as Bhagat Singh, Batukeshwar Dutt, and Chandra Shekhar Azad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This term, originally coined by Colonial masters, is still perpetuated in educational materials, leading to protests from the descendants of these freedom fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This use of language can create misleading connotations, especially for young readers who associate "terrorist" with modern-day terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Suppression of Alternate Views
The suppression of alternative historical viewpoints is a significant challenge. After independence, the political establishment sought to highlight a specific view of the freedom struggle, ensuring that anyone outside the "mainstream" non-violent movement did not receive due recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:12]</a>. For example, historian R.C. Majumdar was initially commissioned to write an official history of the freedom struggle but was removed when he insisted on being critical of figures like Mahatma Gandhi and highlighting their failures, asserting that India might have gained independence much earlier without certain "flip-flop policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. Instead, a bureaucrat with no background in modern Indian history was tasked with the project, sending a clear message to other historians about the preferred narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

This led to a culture where towing the official line was necessary for academics to secure jobs, patronage, and awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. The lack of platforms for alternative voices, unlike today's social media, further solidified this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

## External and Internal Influences

The interpretation of historical events is not just shaped by internal politics but also by external geopolitical forces.

### Geopolitical Branding
There's a belief that global geopolitical powers, particularly the Western bloc (Britain and later America), have influenced the narrative of Indian history, especially regarding the branding of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. This "intense branding" is seen as a reason why many people primarily visualize Mahatma Gandhi when thinking of the Indian Freedom Struggle, even though other figures like V. D. Savarkar and Bhagat Singh also played significant roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. The classification of historical documents, such as the Mountbatten papers, further fuels speculation about undisclosed agreements or influences that shaped India's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>.

### Post-Independence Collaborators
A significant challenge comes from individuals who were part of the "collaborator gang" under the British Raj and subsequently rose to positions of power in the new Indian government, bureaucracy, and intellectual circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. These individuals or their descendants, who became historians, bureaucrats, and intellectuals, ensured that a lot of truth was "suppressed and kept under the carpet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

An example is Yashpal, an individual clearly identified in British intelligence reports as "our man" and who allegedly betrayed revolutionaries like Chandra Shekhar Azad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. Despite this, after independence, Yashpal became a celebrated intellectual, winning awards and writing books that glorified his own role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. This highlights how the narrative of free India was choreographed to exclude, demonize, or eulogize certain figures, often to present the British in a favorable light â€“ implying independence was granted peacefully rather than achieved through struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Unveiling Truth

The current "information age" presents an opportunity to unveil hidden historical truths, as "light is the best disinfectant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. Young people, in particular, are curious about what has been hidden from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.

### Consequences of Suppressing Truth
The suppression of historical facts can have long-lasting, negative consequences. When a nation covers up or fabricates its history, especially concerning atrocities, genocides, or murders, the "unhealed energy" continues to affect future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. For example, the 1948 anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin carnage in Maharashtra, following Gandhi's murder, saw widespread killings, property loss, and ethnic cleansing in various villages, with perpetrators often linked to the Congress party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. This event, which saw no cases filed or justice served, illustrates how unaddressed historical injustices can set precedents for future conflicts, such as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Many victims' families still fear retribution from the powerful descendants of perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

### The Path Forward: Objectivity and Reconciliation
To move forward confidently, a nation needs to make peace with its past through "Truth and Reconciliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This means engaging in an honest assessment of history, rather than using it as a tool for "contemporary political correctness" or to construct a false edifice of national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The "divide and rule" strategy, employed by invaders for a thousand years and visible today in internal political divisions, can only be overcome by addressing historical truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

It is crucial for individuals to read diverse opinions, keeping an open mind, and form their own informed conclusions rather than relying on rhetoric, assumptions, or political propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. This critical engagement with history is essential for preventing past mistakes from recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.

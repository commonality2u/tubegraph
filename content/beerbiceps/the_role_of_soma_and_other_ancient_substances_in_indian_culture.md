## Understanding "Mythology" in Indian Context

The term "mythology" can be seen as offensive by some in India, as it was imposed by imperialist Europeans who dismissed Indian history and culture as untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, another perspective in India categorizes texts like the Ramayan, Mahabharat, Vishnu Puran, and Shiv Puran under "mythology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Personally, the speaker prefers to refer to these as [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian history]] and [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. There is a recognized need for youth and even older generations to learn more about this subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Soma: An Invigorating Plant

Soma is described as a very misunderstood and misrepresented substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Contrary to some interpretations, it was not a psychedelic but an invigorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The theory suggests Soma likely triggered the release of adrenaline in the body, providing an adrenaline rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. While some earlier research suggested it might have been a mushroom with psychedelic properties, the descriptions in ancient texts do not align with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

The entire ninth Mandala of the Rig Veda is dedicated to Soma, highlighting its significant role in [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient Hindu culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. It is speculated that Soma might have played a part in the "cognitive revolution" of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Preparation and Effects

Soma was prepared by pressing juice from stalks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>, indicating it was likely derived from a creeper or shrub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. The stems were crushed, and the extracted juice was filtered through a sheep's cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This juice was described as slightly bitter and was mixed with milk or curd before being offered to the gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

Indra, a prominent deity, was described as drinking "pots of Soma" when preparing for war, which supports the idea of it being an invigorating substance rather than an intoxicant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. An adrenaline rush causes dilated pupils, faster breathing, increased muscle oxygen, and dilated blood vessels, preparing the body for "fight or flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. Soma was likely a natural parallel to modern performance-enhancing substances like adrenaline-releasing chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

### Soma's Geographic Origin and Cultural Legacy

Soma is described as being found in mountain regions, specifically the Himalayan Mountains, with its range possibly extending from Tibet to Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. Its identification has been lost, but the plant likely still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

Interestingly, the Parsis in Mumbai have a "haa" ceremony, which is similar to the Soma ceremony of the Vedic people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. The Vedic and Iranian civilizations developed almost concurrently, possibly as antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. The Parsi "haa" ceremony also involves extracting juice from a plant stock, filtered using a specific apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. Until recent times, the stock for this ceremony was imported from Afghanistan, reinforcing the geographical connection of Soma's origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

The loss of access after partition and a lack of interest in exploring this aspect of [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] contributed to the discontinuity of Soma knowledge in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## Sanjivini and Lost Botanical Knowledge

The Ramayana mentions Sanjivini, one of four different herbs Hanuman was sent to retrieve, going twice to the mountains to get them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. The version of Ramayana commonly known is often Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, but Valmiki Ramayan, the original, describes these other herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

Much of [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient botany]] is now lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. There are many shrubs and plants, especially deep inside the Himalayas, possibly under snow, that have not been rediscovered by modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Local communities in these regions often possess some knowledge about these plants and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. This suggests that Soma, like Sanjivini, could be derived from one of these unknown plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

The exploration of Soma and other ancient substances reveals a rich, complex, and often scientifically advanced [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] whose knowledge has been significantly lost over time due to invasions and a shift towards Westernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Rediscovering this lost history requires an open mind and a scientific inquiry into texts written in Sanskrit and other regional languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

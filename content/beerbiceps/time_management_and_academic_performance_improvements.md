Balancing college life with the demands of running a successful YouTube channel like Slayy Point has provided valuable insights into [[the_importance_of_routine_and_productivity | time management]] and its unexpected positive impact on academic performance.

## The Challenge of Balancing Commitments

The founders of Slayy Point, two 21-year-olds, found that managing college attendance and maintaining consistency on YouTube was their toughest challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Their college required at least 75% attendance, meaning they couldn't miss more than one day a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This strict requirement forced them to complete all shoots within a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. After college, while others might chill, they would immediately rush home to script, ideate, or shoot content, sometimes working until late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. They sometimes couldn't even take a single day or half-day off in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Their upbringing instilled the belief that one must always [[selfdiscipline_and_studying | study]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Therefore, quitting studies for YouTube was never an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Their parents would not have allowed them to continue with YouTube if their academic performance suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Academic Performance Improvements

Despite the intense schedule, the Slayy Point founders observed a surprising outcome: their academic marks actually increased after they started doing YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

This improvement is attributed to several factors:
*   **Prioritization and Scheduling**: They learned to make a proper schedule and prioritize tasks, deciding what was most important to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Equal Importance**: Both studies and YouTube were treated with equal importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. They would stay up all night before exams and [[selfdiscipline_and_studying | study]] for as long as needed, never compromising on either commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Efficient Time Utilization**: They realized that many people do not make the best use of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. By balancing multiple demanding tasks, they developed a life skill of achieving much more in a shorter amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. For example, a chapter that took friends 6-7 hours could be completed in 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

They describe their approach as one of dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, ensuring they complete all assigned academic portions and know every point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This disciplined approach was honed by the necessity to maintain good grades to continue their YouTube pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

> "If this is the portion and I'm supposed to complete it then I'm supposed to complete it and I'm supposed to know each and every point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

## Applicability to Others

The Slayy Point founders believe that any college student can achieve similar results if they are interested and dedicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Their experience shows that skills like video creation and business management were learned over time simply by being interested in making content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This suggests that the improved [[the_importance_of_routine_and_productivity | time management]] and efficiency they gained are transferable skills, not unique talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

This article outlines a [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | basic skincare routine]] applicable to all skin types, including oily, dry, or regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Following this routine consistently is claimed to help prevent acne, blemishes, skin bumps, irritation, and other skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The recommendations prioritize natural and herbal products over chemically made alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Frequency
It is essential to wash your face at least twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up or arriving at work/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you engage in cardio or activities that cause significant sweating (like football or cricket), an additional wash in the middle of the day after your session is acceptable, but generally, twice a day is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Product Selection
While mild face washes were previously recommended, 100% herbal face washes are now preferred due to their nutritional benefits for the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Be cautious of large brands claiming to be Ayurvedic, as they may only contain Ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

**Recommended Brands:**
*   **Budget-friendly:** Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   **Premium:** Kama Ayurveda, Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

The speaker personally uses a rose water face wash and an Ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Application Technique
1.  **Preparation:** Wash your face after shaving or showering when pores are slightly opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The face wash helps close pores and clean the skin, while herbal options also provide nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
2.  **Amount:** Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  **Application:** Rub the product between your hands and apply it to three main regions of the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>:
    *   **Cheeks:** Apply in a circular motion for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck:** Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **T-area (forehead, nose, chin):** Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    Applying in a circular motion increases blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes growth, and cleans dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Be gentle but firm with your strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
4.  **Sitting Time (Herbal):** If using a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to work its magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
5.  **Rinsing:** Wash off with room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Avoid hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Moisturizers

Natural moisturizers are recommended over chemically made ones, as chemical options can clog pores, increase acne, and destroy beneficial bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Essential Items:
*   **Cotton Balls:** Use a clean jar of cotton balls to apply moisturizers, as hands can transfer dirt and bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Natural Moisturizers:
*   **Rose Water:** Acts as a disinfectant and can be applied twice a day, once before heading out and once before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Khadi is a recommended brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice:** Helps fight acne and reduce blemishes or black marks left by acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Frequency:** Apply no more than once or twice a week, as it is stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   **Application:** Squeeze half a lime into a bowl, soak a cotton swab, and apply it to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Caution:** Lime juice may cause a stinging sensation, which indicates it's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If it's too strong, mix it with a bit of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera:** A powerful medicinal plant, its pulp can be used as a moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Application:** Tear open an aloe vera leaf, scrape out the pulp with a nail, and apply the gel to the face, possibly mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Especially effective for extremely dry skin or bad acne, use once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It may also cause a slight stinging sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products

While the natural moisturizers listed above serve as long-term anti-acne solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, specific short-term products are useful when acne is active or pimples are fresh and painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Preferred Options: Herbal Oils
Natural herbal oils are recommended before turning to antibiotics, as antibiotics can destroy beneficial bacteria on the face with overuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Characteristics:** These are low-density skin oils, unlike dense oils such as coconut oil, which can clog pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** They reduce inflammation and redness of pimples by being absorbed by the skin, helping them heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Sweet almond oil, rosehip oil, tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Last Resort: Antibiotics
An antibiotic like Clinda (available at general stores) can be used if herbal oils are ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, avoid overuse to protect the good bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## [[diet_and_lifestyle_factors_affecting_skin_health | Diet and Lifestyle Factors Affecting Skin Health]]

Your [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | diet and lifestyle factors]] play a significant role in skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Diet
*   **Avoid:** Quit sugar, reduce junk food or restaurant food, and completely avoid packaged fried snacks (which often contain unhealthy oils and trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Include:** Incorporate more vegetables and fruits into your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Balance:** Do not overdo any single type of food, such as non-vegetarian proteins (eggs, meat) or particular vegetarian protein sources (paneer, soya chunks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Lifestyle
*   **Stress Reduction:** High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin quality, aging, and increases oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. To reduce cortisol long-term, focus on:
    *   **Sleep Hygiene:** Improve the quality of your sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Meditation:** Regular meditation can significantly reduce stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

These lifestyle factors are as crucial as diet and product application for improving skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

This article outlines a basic [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] applicable to various skin types, including oily, dry, or regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It focuses on an [[indian_skincare_recommendations_and_product_suggestions | Indian skincare routine]] that aims to prevent acne, blemishes, skin bumps, irritation, and other skin problems if followed consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The recommendations are presented as honest advice, prioritizing consumer knowledge over brand sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

The face washing routine follows a few golden rules:

### Frequency
*   Wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up or reaching your office/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   If you engage in cardio or activities that cause a lot of sweating (like football or cricket), you can wash your face a third time after your session in the middle of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Ideally, stick to twice a day and only go to thrice on occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Product Choice
*   Prioritize 100% [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | herbal face washes]] over mild or chemical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Be cautious of big brands claiming to be Ayurvedic, as they may only contain Ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Recommended Brands**:
    *   **Budget-friendly**: Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   **Premium**: K Aura and Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. These brands produce 100% natural Ayurvedic herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Personal preference: Rose water face wash and Ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Application [[methods_for_applying_skincare_products_properly | Method]]
*   It's preferred to wash your face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to clean and close them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | Ayurvedic face washes]] also provide nutrition to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   Rub it all over your hands before applying it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Apply to three main regions in a circular motion:
    1.  **Cheeks**: Rub for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    2.  **Chin and Neck**: Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    3.  **T-area (forehead, nose, and chin)**: Rub in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Circular Motion**: Increases blood flow, rejuvenates skin, promotes growth, and cleans dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Avoid rubbing up and down as it can damage skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Be gentle but firm with strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Dwell Time**: If using a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to let it work before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Water Temperature**: Do not use hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Use room temperature or tepid (slightly hotter than room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Moisturizers

This routine's moisturizers are suitable for dry, regular, and oily skin, as they are natural and do not clog pores or harm beneficial skin bacteria like some chemical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Chemical moisturizers can sometimes act as disinfectants, destroying both good and bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Essential Tools
*   **Cotton Balls**: Always use clean cotton balls to apply moisturizers to avoid transferring dirt or bacteria from your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Natural Moisturizers
*   **Rose Water**:
    *   Acts as a disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Apply twice a day: once before heading out and once at night before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Khadi is a recommended brand, though rose water products are widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice**:
    *   Squeeze half a lime into a bowl, dip a cotton swab, and apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Apply no more than once or twice a week due to its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Fights acne and helps fade blemishes or black marks left by acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   If it stings too much, mix it with a little water; stinging indicates it's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera**:
    *   Use the pulp from an aloe vera plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Tear open the skin, squeeze, or scrape out the pulp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   Can be mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Apply the gel with a cotton swab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   It may sting a little but is a powerful moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   For extremely dry skin or very bad acne, apply aloe vera with lime juice once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products (Short-term)

While the natural moisturizers serve as long-term anti-acne solutions, some products are specifically for active acne or fresh pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Natural Herbal Oils**:
    *   These are low-density skin oils, unlike dense oils like coconut oil, which can clog pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   They are absorbed by the pimple, reducing inflammation and redness, helping the pimple heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Sweet almond oil, rosehip oil, or tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Always try these first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Antibiotics**:
    *   An example is "Clinda" gel, available at general stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   **Caution**: Overuse of antibiotics can destroy the beneficial bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Only turn to them if natural oils don't work, and do not overuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## [[diet_lifestyle_and_stress_management_for_skincare | Diet and Lifestyle Factors]]

[[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | Diet and lifestyle]] play a significant role in skin health, particularly in managing acne.

*   **Diet**:
    *   Eliminate sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Reduce junk food, restaurant food, and packaged fried snacks (which often contain refined flour and unhealthy trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   Increase intake of vegetables and fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   Avoid overconsumption of any single food type, whether non-vegetarian, eggs, or vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Stress Management**:
    *   High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin, aging, and skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It can also cause sebaceous (oil) glands to secrete more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
    *   To reduce cortisol long-term:
        *   Improve **sleep hygiene** (quality of sleep) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
        *   **Meditate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   Both meditation and quality sleep can reduce stress and enhance skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

This basic [[skincare_routine_for_men_with_oily_skin | skincare routine]] is applicable whether you have oily skin, dry skin, or regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The advice is based on honesty and consumer knowledge, avoiding brand endorsements to provide genuine recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Following this routine can help prevent [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | acne]], blemishes, skin bumps, skin irritation, and other skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

### Frequency
It's recommended to wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before going to bed and once in the morning after waking up or arriving at your office/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you sweat a lot due to cardio activities like football or cricket, you can wash your face a third time after your session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Ideally, stick to twice a day, only going to thrice on occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Type of Face Wash
Always use a 100% herbal face wash, especially since more options are available in the Indian market now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Be cautious of big companies claiming "Ayurvedic" products, as they often contain only Ayurvedic ingredients, not fully herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

**Recommended Brands**:
*   **Budget-friendly**: Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   **Premium**: Kama Ayurveda, Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
These brands are known for making 100% natural, Ayurvedic, herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Application Technique
Washing your face after shaving or showering is preferred, as your pores are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to clean and close them more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Herbal face washes also provide nutrition to your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

1.  Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel (e.g., aloe vera gel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
2.  Rub it all over your hands and apply it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
3.  **Regions of Focus**:
    *   **Cheeks**: Apply in a circular motion for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck**: Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **T-area (forehead, nose, chin)**: Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    Circular motions increase blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes growth, and helps clean dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Be gentle but firm with your strokes to avoid damaging the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  **Sitting Time**: If using a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to work its magic before washing off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
5.  **Water Temperature**: Wash your face with room temperature or tepid (slightly hotter than room temperature, but not hot) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Avoid hot or freezing cold water as both can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Moisturizers

Natural moisturizers are preferred over chemically made ones, as chemical moisturizers can clog pores, increase acne, and destroy good bacteria on your face that fight bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

**Tools**: Use a clean jar of cotton balls to apply moisturizers, as hands can carry dirty bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Recommended Natural Moisturizers:

*   **Rose Water**: Acts as a disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Apply twice a day: once before heading out and once at night before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice**: Apply only once to twice a week as it's stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It helps fight [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | acne]] and fade blemishes or black marks left by acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If it stings too much, mix it with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera**: A powerful medicinal plant with pulp that provides significant moisturizing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. You can scrape the pulp from a plant or use an aloe vera gel product. It can be mixed with lime water for extremely dry skin or bad acne, applied once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

These [[natural_skincare_remedies_for_dry_and_oily_skin | natural moisturizers]] are suitable for all skin types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | Anti-Acne Products and Natural Solutions]]

While natural moisturizers offer long-term [[AntiAcne Products and Natural Solutions | anti-acne]] benefits, specific solutions are available for active pimples.

*   **Antibiotics (e.g., Clinda)**: Can be used for fresh, painful pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, overuse can destroy the good bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Low-Density Herbal Oils**: These are preferred as a first line of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Unlike dense oils (like coconut oil) that can clog pimples, low-density oils are absorbed and help reduce inflammation and redness, promoting faster healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Examples include sweet almond oil, rose hip oil, or tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Always try these oils first before resorting to antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## [[Impact of Diet on Skin Health | Impact of Diet on Skin Health]] and [[Importance of Diet and Lifestyle for Skin Health | Lifestyle Factors for Skin Health]]

[[dietary_advice_for_healthy_glowing_skin | Diet]] and lifestyle significantly impact skin health.

### Dietary Factors:
*   **Reduce Sugar**: Quit sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Limit Junk Food**: Reduce consumption of junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Avoid Packaged Fried Snacks**: Say no to packaged fried snacks, which are often full of bad oils and trans fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Increase Fruits and Vegetables**: Include a lot more vegetables and fruits in your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Balanced Protein Intake**: Avoid overdoing any single food type, such as non-vegetarian food, eggs, or specific vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Lifestyle Factors:
*   **Reduce Stress**: High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin, aging, skin quality, and can increase oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Improve Sleep Hygiene**: The quality of your sleep significantly impacts cortisol reduction and skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Meditate**: Meditation, along with good sleep, can reduce stress levels and improve skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

These lifestyle factors are as crucial as direct skincare practices for overall skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

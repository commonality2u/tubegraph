Dermatology, unfortunately, has become a field that is sometimes trivialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many people claim the realm of dermatology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, true differentiation between a good and great dermatologist lies in being a legitimate, qualified, board-certified dermatologist and understanding the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It's about being a pure clinician, getting to the diagnosis first, and starting with the simplest solutions, such as lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The goal is to make patients independent of their dermatologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Understanding Adult Acne

[[antiacne_products_and_remedies | Adult acne]] is a very common skin problem, especially in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In contrast, tier 2 and tier 3 cities tend to have less adult acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Singapore even declared acne a pandemic at one point due to its prevalence and antibiotic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

### [[role_of_stress_and_hormonal_imbalances_in_skin_issues | Causes of Adult Acne]]

Several factors contribute to adult acne:

*   **Diet and Lifestyle:**
    *   **Protein Supplements:** Excessive protein supplements that cannot be digested by the body, especially in the absence of carbs, can be inflammatory and lead to acne on the back and face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   **Excessive Dieting:** Zero-fat, zero-carb, keto diets, and intermittent fasting can disrupt hormone cycles, leading to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. If a diet causes disruption, acne, redness, irritated skin, chapped skin, hairfall, folliculitis, or exacerbates existing conditions like eczema or psoriasis, it's not the right diet for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Dairy:** Dairy and dairy products, except curd (yogurt), buttermilk, and ghee, are often recommended to be cut from the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Curd is considered a "broken dairy" with good bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
    *   **Processed Foods:** Cheese, chips, and anything that comes in a packet or contains hidden processed ingredients should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This also includes protein powders from packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Sugars and Artificial Sweeteners:** Any form of sugar, including fruit sugar (fructose) in pre-packed foods, can cause insulin spikes, leading to insulin resistance and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Excessive insulin can also cause other hormone disruptions and contribute to conditions like PCOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
    *   **Listen to Your Body:** What suits one person may not suit another due to individual physiological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. As you age, your body also accepts and rejects different foods, and it needs less food overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. Paying attention to what causes bloating, discomfort, or burping can indicate foods your gut isn't handling well, which can then manifest on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **Stress:** The stress of looking good can be a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Any form of stress, including lack of sleep, can cause acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Skin, hair, and nails are diagnostic tools for what's happening inside the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Imbalances:**
    *   **Testosterone:** Males generally have more sebaceous glands (oil glands) which are influenced by testosterone, leading to more oil secretion and larger pores, making them more prone to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.
    *   **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome):** This condition in women, often linked to insulin resistance and LH (Lutenizing Hormone) surge, can lead to increased male hormones (DHE, testosterone, DHT) and inflammatory female hormones (prolactin), causing angry, red acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Prolactin excess can also cause acne and breast tenderness in both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Pollution:** While pollution does affect skin health (leading to allergies and eczema), its direct impact on acne is considered less significant than stress, food, hormones, and hereditary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **External Factors:**
    *   **Steroid Abuse:** Long-term use of topical steroids (like Ovalo, Desal, Elal) can cause acneiform eruptions that resemble acne but are difficult to treat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. These are often used to treat acne in the first place, but used in the wrong way can cause nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
    *   **Wrong Products:** Applying certain creams or products can cause breakouts, indicating an inflammatory or allergic reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
    *   **Makeup Applicators:** Makeup itself doesn't harm the skin, but uncleaned applicators, sponges, and brushes can harbor bacteria and transfer infection, leading to irritation and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

## Diagnosis of Adult Acne

A detailed consultation is crucial to understand the patient's history, from childhood to present, including family skin history and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

### Blood Tests

Blood tests can indicate core problems, but they are not done randomly due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. They are ordered only if clinical examination and history suggest a hormonal driven acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. For example, if a man has [[causes_and_treatment_options_for_gynecomastia | gynecomastia]] and breast tenderness, prolactin levels might be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. For women with acne, hair loss, or facial hair growth, androgen levels might be checked to determine if the excess is adrenal or ovarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Insulin resistance can be suspected if there is dark, thick skin on the neck (acanthosis nigricans) and overweight status; in such cases, fasting insulin and HbA1c tests are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Clinical Examination

Dermatologists can often tell the type of acne by looking at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Different types include:
*   Pustules (little white bumps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>
*   Steroid abuse acne (looks like acne but is due to topical steroid use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>
*   Folliculitis (infected hair follicles, common in beard area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>
*   Inflamed/infected acne (red, angry, painful, with pus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>
*   Blackheads and whiteheads (initial stages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>
*   Painful, hard pimples and nodules (severe form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>

## [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | Treatment Options for Adult Acne]]

Treatment for acne ranges from lifestyle adjustments to medical procedures.

### Lifestyle and Diet Adjustments

*   **Sleep:** Sleeping well can help solve acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Scalp Hygiene:** Washing your scalp well can also help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Stress Management:** Managing stress can significantly improve skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Yoga, for example, balances hormones, calms the mind, and improves circulation and detoxification by moving muscles, which act as peripheral hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.
*   **Personalized Diet:** Everyone's body is different, so it's important to figure out which foods and diets work for your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This often involves trial and error to see what causes discomfort or skin issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>.

### Medical Treatments

*   **Antibiotics:** Short-term use (7-10 days, or pulse therapy for severe cases) of antibiotics can relieve pain by subsiding infection and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. To mitigate gut disruption, good gut bacteria (probiotics) are often given concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Long-term use of antibiotics is generally avoided as it can severely disrupt gut flora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **Topical Benzoyl Peroxide:** This chemical stops bacteria growth and reduces oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. It should be used cautiously as it can be very irritating to the skin, causing redness and dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Intralesional Steroids:** A tiny bit of steroid can be injected directly into a persistent acne lesion for quick inflammation suppression, often used for actors before shoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This must be done by a qualified dermatologist to avoid side effects like tissue damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Isotretinoin (Accutane):** This is an oral form of retinoid (a vitamin A derivative) that effectively dries out all glands, including oil glands, leading to dry skin, lips, eyes, and even hair brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. It is teratogenic (can cause harm to a baby) and thus contraindicated during pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. While effective for severe or hereditary cystic acne, it can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and derange lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. A very low dose (5mg) is sometimes used for anti-aging purposes, but this is a nascent study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.
*   **Microneedling Radiofrequency:** This procedure uses tiny needles to deliver radiofrequency at specific depths to shrink oil glands permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. As a side effect, it also treats scars by increasing collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>. It is an expensive treatment, but it is important not to compromise on quality in medical procedures, as improper execution (e.g., dull needles, wrong depth, reusing disposables) can cause skin damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Chemical Peels:**
    *   Peels involve applying chemicals to the skin to remove the top dead layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>.
    *   **Very Superficial Peels:** Take away the top dead layer, making skin look brighter, with no downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:13">[01:48:13]</a>.
    *   **Superficial Peels:** Go a little deeper, causing slight redness or irritation for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>.
    *   **Medium Depth Peels:** Cause a little rough and sloughing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:37">[01:48:37]</a>.
    *   **Deep Peels:** Literally remove a portion of the skin and require extensive downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>. These are not recommended for brown skin due to the high risk of severe pigmentation or scarring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
    *   Peels can clear complexion, brighten skin, fade acne scars, and blend uneven tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:43">[01:53:43]</a>. They are office procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>.
*   **Bio-Stimulatory Injections:** Injections of substances like hyaluronic acid under the skin can provide hydration, a dewy look, and stimulate collagen and elastin without changing facial contour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>. They can also work wonders for acne scars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

## General Skincare Principles

[[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | Skincare]] is not like fashion; using the wrong product, even once, can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. It's crucial to choose products based on individual skin type and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### Skincare Routine

A [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] involves three main steps:
1.  **Cleanse:** Choosing the correct cleanser is vital, as a wrong one can irritate and lead to pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. For oily or acne-prone skin, avoid over-drying, as the oil glands may produce even more oil in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. If exposed to pollution or heavy makeup, a pre-cleanse (e.g., oil-soluble cleanser or micellar water) may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
2.  **Protect:** Protect your skin from free radical damage, pollution, sun, and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
    *   **Sunscreen:** [[common_cosmetic_dermatology_procedures_and_their_effects | Sunscreen]] is a must for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. Modern formulations protect against UV, visible, and infrared light, which can be inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Not using sunscreen can lead to faster aging, more pigmentation, dehydration, and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. While early morning sun is good for vitamin D and happy hormones, the sun's intensity and increased skin abuse today make sunscreen essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.
    *   **Moisturizer:** A moisturizer itself acts as a form of protection against dust and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
3.  **Nourish:** Provide your skin with what it needs to quench and calm itself, which can include good moisturizers or ingredients like licorice and calendula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Aloe vera, despite its popularity, may not always be effective due to the short lifespan of its medicinal values after extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

### Exfoliation

Exfoliation is the gentle loosening of the top dead layer of skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. It can be done physically (with fine-grained products like rice powder or sugar) or chemically (with acids like AHAs, BHAs, lactic acid, salicylic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Rough scrubbing with thick granules is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. Gentle exfoliation can be done once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

### Popular Ingredients

*   **Vitamin C:** Can be harmful if skin is dry, chapped, sensitive, sunburned, or has eczema, as it is an acid that can cause sensitization and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** Provides hydration to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. It works best for normal, calm, oily skin needing moisture, but can irritate dry, sensitive, or red skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:02">[01:38:02]</a>.
*   **Retinol (Retinoic Acid):** An old, well-studied anti-aging ingredient that increases cell turnover and repairs cells, making skin look youthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. It is not for everyone; it works best for thicker, acne-prone, oily skin types but can irritate thin, dry, sensitive skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:46">[01:35:46]</a>. Retinol also helps acne by reducing oil glands and clogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. If using retinol, strict sun protection is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>.

### Lymphatic Drainage Massage

Lymphatic drainage massages can help reduce puffiness and inflammation by draining stagnated fluid and waste from tissues, improving circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. This can lead to clearer, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

## Psychological Impact of Skin Issues

Skin problems, such as acne, can cause significant psychological issues and impact confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:16">[02:07:16]</a>. Healthy skin is a reflection of internal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>. Seeking medical advice for skin conditions is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:49">[02:07:49]</a>. It's important not to look down on those seeking to improve their appearance, as it can significantly enhance their quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:43">[02:10:43]</a>.# Causes and Treatments for Adult Acne

    *   **Sugars and Artificial Sweeteners:** Any form of sugar, including fruit sugar (fructose) in pre-packed foods, can cause insulin spikes, leading to insulin resistance and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Excessive insulin can also cause other hormone disruptions and contribute to conditions like PCOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

As you age, your body also accepts and rejects different foods, and it needs less food overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. Paying attention to what causes bloating, discomfort, or burping can indicate foods your gut isn't handling well, which can then manifest on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **Stress:** The stress of looking good can be a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Any form of stress, including lack of sleep, can cause acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

    *   **Makeup Applicators:** Makeup itself doesn't harm the skin, but uncleaned applicators, sponges, and brushes can harbor bacteria and transfer infection, leading to irritation and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

## Diagnosis of Adult Acne

A detailed consultation is crucial to understand the patient's history, from childhood to present, including family skin history and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

### Blood Tests

Blood tests can indicate core problems, but they are not done randomly due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. They are ordered only if clinical examination and history suggest a hormonal driven acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. For example, if a man has [[causes_and_treatment_options_for_gynecomastia | gynecomastia]] and breast tenderness, prolactin levels might be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. For women with acne, hair loss, or facial hair growth, androgen levels might be checked to determine if the excess is adrenal or ovarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Insulin resistance can be suspected if there is dark, thick skin on the neck (acanthosis nigricans) and overweight status; in such cases, fasting insulin and HbA1c tests are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Clinical Examination

Dermatologists can often tell the type of acne by looking at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Different types include:
*   Pustules (little white bumps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>
*   Steroid abuse acne (looks like acne but is due to topical steroid use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>
*   Folliculitis (infected hair follicles, common in beard area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>
*   Inflamed/infected acne (red, angry, painful, with pus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>
*   Blackheads and whiteheads (initial stages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>
*   Painful, hard pimples and nodules (severe form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>

## [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | Treatment Options for Adult Acne]]

Treatment for acne ranges from lifestyle adjustments to medical procedures.

### [[diet_and_lifestyle_factors_affecting_skin_health | Lifestyle and Diet Adjustments]]

*   **Sleep:** Sleeping well can help solve acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Scalp Hygiene:** Washing your scalp well can also help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Stress Management:** Managing stress can significantly improve skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Yoga, for example, balances hormones, calms the mind, and improves circulation and detoxification by moving muscles, which act as peripheral hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.
*   **Personalized Diet:** Everyone's body is different, so it's important to figure out which foods and diets work for your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This often involves trial and error to see what causes discomfort or skin issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>.

### Medical Treatments

*   **Antibiotics:** Short-term use (7-10 days, or pulse therapy for severe cases) of antibiotics can relieve pain by subsiding infection and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. To mitigate gut disruption, good gut bacteria (probiotics) are often given concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Long-term use of antibiotics is generally avoided as it can severely disrupt gut flora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **Topical Benzoyl Peroxide:** This chemical stops bacteria growth and reduces oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. It should be used cautiously as it can be very irritating to the skin, causing redness and dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Intralesional Steroids:** A tiny bit of steroid can be injected directly into a persistent acne lesion for quick inflammation suppression, often used for actors before shoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This must be done by a qualified dermatologist to avoid side effects like tissue damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Isotretinoin (Accutane):** This is an oral form of retinoid (a vitamin A derivative) that effectively dries out all glands, including oil glands, leading to dry skin, lips, eyes, and even hair brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. It is teratogenic (can cause harm to a baby) and thus contraindicated during pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. While effective for severe or hereditary cystic acne, it can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and derange lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. A very low dose (5mg) is sometimes used for anti-aging purposes, but this is a nascent study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.
*   **Microneedling Radiofrequency:** This procedure uses tiny needles to deliver radiofrequency at specific depths to shrink oil glands permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. As a side effect, it also treats scars by increasing collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>. It is an expensive treatment, but it is important not to compromise on quality in medical procedures, as improper execution (e.g., dull needles, wrong depth, reusing disposables) can cause skin damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Chemical Peels:**
    *   Peels involve applying chemicals to the skin to remove the top dead layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>.
    *   **Very Superficial Peels:** Take away the top dead layer, making skin look brighter, with no downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:13">[01:48:13]</a>.
    *   **Superficial Peels:** Go a little deeper, causing slight redness or irritation for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>.
    *   **Medium Depth Peels:** Cause a little rough and sloughing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:37">[01:48:37]</a>.
    *   **Deep Peels:** Literally remove a portion of the skin and require extensive downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>. These are not recommended for brown skin due to the high risk of severe pigmentation or scarring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
    *   Peels can clear complexion, brighten skin, fade acne scars, and blend uneven tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:43">[01:53:43]</a>. They are office procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>.
*   **Bio-Stimulatory Injections:** Injections of substances like hyaluronic acid under the skin can provide hydration, a dewy look, and stimulate collagen and elastin without changing facial contour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>. They can also work wonders for acne scars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

## General Skincare Principles

[[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | Skincare]] is not like fashion; using the wrong product, even once, can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. It's crucial to choose products based on individual skin type and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### Skincare Routine

A [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] involves three main steps:
1.  **Cleanse:** Choosing the correct cleanser is vital, as a wrong one can irritate and lead to pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. For oily or [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | acne-prone skin]], avoid over-drying, as the oil glands may produce even more oil in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. If exposed to pollution or heavy makeup, a pre-cleanse (e.g., oil-soluble cleanser or micellar water) may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
2.  **Protect:** Protect your skin from free radical damage, pollution, sun, and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
    *   **Sunscreen:** [[common_cosmetic_dermatology_procedures_and_their_effects | Sunscreen]] is a must for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. Modern formulations protect against UV, visible, and infrared light, which can be inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Not using sunscreen can lead to faster aging, more pigmentation, dehydration, and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. While early morning sun is good for vitamin D and happy hormones, the sun's intensity and increased skin abuse today make sunscreen essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.
    *   **Moisturizer:** A moisturizer itself acts as a form of protection against dust and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
3.  **Nourish:** Provide your skin with what it needs to quench and calm itself, which can include good moisturizers or ingredients like licorice and calendula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Aloe vera, despite its popularity, may not always be effective due to the short lifespan of its medicinal values after extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

### Exfoliation

Exfoliation is the gentle loosening of the top dead layer of skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. It can be done physically (with fine-grained products like rice powder or sugar) or chemically (with acids like AHAs, BHAs, lactic acid, salicylic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Rough scrubbing with thick granules is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. Gentle exfoliation can be done once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

### Popular Ingredients

*   **Vitamin C:** Can be harmful if skin is dry, chapped, sensitive, sunburned, or has eczema, as it is an acid that can cause sensitization and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** Provides hydration to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. It works best for normal, calm, oily skin needing moisture, but can irritate dry, sensitive, or red skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:02">[01:38:02]</a>.
*   **Retinol (Retinoic Acid):** An old, well-studied anti-aging ingredient that increases cell turnover and repairs cells, making skin look youthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. It is not for everyone; it works best for thicker, acne-prone, oily skin types but can irritate thin, dry, sensitive skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:46">[01:35:46]</a>. Retinol also helps acne by reducing oil glands and clogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. If using retinol, strict sun protection is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>.

### Lymphatic Drainage Massage

Lymphatic drainage massages can help reduce puffiness and inflammation by draining stagnated fluid and waste from tissues, improving circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. This can lead to clearer, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

## Psychological Impact of Skin Issues

Skin problems, such as acne, can cause significant psychological issues and impact confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:16">[02:07:16]</a>. Healthy skin is a reflection of internal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>. Seeking medical advice for skin conditions is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:49">[02:07:49]</a>. It's important not to look down on those seeking to improve their appearance, as it can significantly enhance their quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:43">[02:10:43]</a>.

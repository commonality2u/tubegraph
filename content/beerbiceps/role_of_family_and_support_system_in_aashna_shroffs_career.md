[[aashna_shroffs_journey_from_a_difficult_family_situation_to_success | Aashna Shroff's journey from a difficult family situation to success]] and her current "dream life" as a prominent fashion blogger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> are deeply intertwined with her family background and the support system she built around herself. Her entire family situation has shaped her into the person she is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Humble Beginnings and Family Responsibility

Aashna Shroff was raised by a single parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Her mother divorced around the time Aashna was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. She grew up living with her maternal grandparents, her mother's masi (aunt), and her mother's older sister, who has Down syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

From a young age, Aashna understood the concept of responsibility due to her family's circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Her mother was the sole earner, supporting five people at home including Aashna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Aashna learned about their struggles by being at home with her grandparents while her mother worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. At one point during her college years, the family had only 1,500 rupees in their account with no clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Her mother was instrumental in overcoming this financial hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Fuelled by Family's Happiness

Aashna's drive and hard work are directly linked to her desire to provide for her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. She gives her earnings to her mother, wanting her to manage the household and enjoy a life she never had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

> "whatever I earn I give to her because I want her to run the house and I want her to enjoy her life because she never got to do that I want to take her on trips I want her to travel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

She still feels they have a long way to go, but her ambition is for her mother to experience luxuries like travel and designer bags, things her mother couldn't afford during her own upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The happiness of her mom and family is the primary fuel for her endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Business Support System

As a blogger and entrepreneur, Aashna has strategically built a support system to manage her business. Recognizing her weakness in negotiating finances, she has her mother's cousin (her masi) handle all monetary discussions with brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This allows her to focus on content creation and production, while her manager covers her weakness with her strength in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Overcoming Initial Skepticism

Despite her current success, Aashna faced skepticism from her family early in her blogging career. A year and a half into blogging, when payments weren't as high as hoped and she was investing significant time and effort, her mother asked her to close the blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Her mother wanted her to focus more on her online store, which was generating more income at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Aashna's "stubbornness," which she also identifies as her biggest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, led to a significant fight with her mother. She cried and insisted she would make time for both ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. She is now grateful that she didn't give up, attributing her current position to that perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

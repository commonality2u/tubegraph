Aggression in sports, particularly in high-stakes environments like international cricket, often plays a significant role in achieving success. For a public figure like Sourav Ganguly, his on-field "aggression" was a distinct characteristic perceived by fans and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Aggression as a Created Persona

Sourav Ganguly clarifies that the aggression displayed during his playing career was a deliberate "creation to be successful and get the team going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. In his personal life, he describes himself as a "very laid-back," "quiet soft" person who rarely gets angry or shouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The on-field aggressive persona emerged due to:
*   **Pressure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   **Expectations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   **The desire to succeed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   **The ambition to elevate the team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>

This strategic aggression was rooted in a specific "style of playing" and was also a factor in how he [[leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | picked players]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. He considered himself to have a "gambling mindset" as a captain, believing that it fostered the necessary attitudes within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

## Contrast with Personal Demeanor

Despite the perceived on-field aggression, Ganguly maintains that his true personality is calm and quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He attributes his current "chill and humble" demeanor to being "lazy to be not chilled" and the wisdom gained from experience, which teaches one to look beyond unnecessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. He believes that handling things "a lot better" comes with experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Players

When compared to [[leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | Virat Kohli]] regarding aggression, Ganguly believes the comparison should focus on skill rather than temperament. He humbly states that Kohli is "more skillful than I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

## Football Analogy: Maradona

Ganguly's admiration for Diego Maradona highlights a different facet of aggression â€“ a "Maverick" genius whose skill allowed him to be "mad" and "overkilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. He contrasts this with [[leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | Messi]], whom he describes as a "skillful gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. Ganguly notes that he could not adopt Maradona's mentality because he "didn't have the skill" to be that aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This suggests that the form and intensity of aggression in sport can be dictated by one's natural ability.

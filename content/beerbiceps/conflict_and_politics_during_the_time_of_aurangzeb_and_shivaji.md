The era preceding and during [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]'s rise to power was dominated by the immense and often brutal influence of the Mughal Empire. Understanding the political landscape, the nature of its rule, and the struggles for power, particularly involving [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]], is crucial to comprehending [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s vision and conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## The Mughal Empire: Power and Administration
The Mughal Empire was the largest empire in the world at the time, encompassing 22 provinces across North India, extending down to the border of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. The Deccan region was primarily under the rule of Sultanates like Nizam Shahi (Maharashtra), Adil Shahi (Karnataka), and Qutub Shahi (Hyderabad/Telangana/Andhra), who were considered vassals to the Mughal emperor, paying tribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. The Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in the south was largely vanishing by the time [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivrai]] was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### Governance Structure
The empire's administration relied heavily on "mansabdars" (or "jagirdars" in the Deccan), who were warriors granted land by the king or sultan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. These mansabdars were responsible for collecting taxes from cultivators (as agriculture was the primary industry) and maintaining a cavalry force for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This system meant that 80% of the Mughal Empire's land was granted to these military men, effectively outsourcing the army and making them powerful "mini-kings" in their areas, often ruling ruthlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

### Immense Wealth
The Mughal Empire's wealth was staggering, derived primarily from extracting resources from cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. For example, the Mughals collected an estimated 1.20 crore rupees (silver coins, each weighing about 10 grams) from 22 provinces, equivalent to 93,000 kilograms of gold, worth approximately $3.5 billion in modern terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. About 20% of this revenue went directly into the emperor's coffers, with the rest used by mansabdars to maintain their forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

### Military Might
The Mughal army was formidable, consisting of 200,000 heavy-duty cavalrymen and 40,000 artillerymen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. They had well-equipped soldiers with helmets, full armor, javelins, heavy-duty swords, and shields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Their artillery used lightweight cannons that could be moved on horseback, firing both explosives and large iron cannonballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. The army also included a "vanguard" with road cleaners and tree cutters, followed by camel cavalry and foot soldiers. The procession stretched for miles, creating an optical illusion of an even larger, more terrifying force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The forces included diverse groups from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkestan, and even some from the Volga region, with racial discrimination prevalent, as darker-skinned Indian Hindus were paid less than those from Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

## Mughal Cruelty and Succession Conflicts
The Mughal dynasty was marked by extreme cruelty, particularly in its succession struggles. There was no rule stating that the firstborn son would inherit the throne; instead, it was a brutal contest where survival often meant eliminating rivals, including close relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. The prevailing mentality was "the throne or the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

### Examples of Brutality
*   **Salim (Jahangir)**: Son of Akbar, Salim (later Emperor Jahangir) was known for his cruelty. When his own son, Khusrau, went against him, Salim tortured him by taking out his eyes and putting salt water into the sockets for "excruciating pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Khusrau, who was favored by Akbar, was later killed by his half-brother, Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Akbar**: Contrary to romanticized portrayals in films, Akbar was also described as cruel, having killed subordinates to take their women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Shah Jahan**: He was responsible for killing 36 potential claimants to the throne, including Khusrau, to secure his own position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

### [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]'s Ascent to Power
[[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]'s rise to power was a prime example of this brutal succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. As one of Shah Jahan's four sons, he engaged in a fierce power struggle with his brothers: Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, and Murad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Shah Jahan had strategically placed his sons in different provinces: Dara Shikoh in fertile Punjab, Shah Shuja in Bengal, and Murad in Gujarat. [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]], whom Shah Jahan saw as a threat, was sent to less fertile regions like the Deccan and the Kabul borders, reducing his financial and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. To gain strength, [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]] targeted the rich Deccan Sultanates (Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi) to seize their treasuries, despite Shah Jahan's orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Manipulation and Warfare**: [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]] cleverly leveraged religious orthodoxy and propaganda. He portrayed Dara Shikoh, who was an intellectual and had discussions with Hindu, Christian, and Muslim scholars, as an "idolater" and "non-believer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. He also manipulated his younger, drunken brother Murad into joining his forces by promising him the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
*   **Key Battles**: [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]] and Murad's forces marched towards Agra, defeating Rajput king Jaswant Singh Rathore, who was sent by Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. At Agra, Dara Shikoh's indecision and [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]'s use of religious lectures to motivate his army led to Dara's defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Fates of Brothers**:
    *   **Dara Shikoh**: After fleeing from Agra to Delhi, then towards Afghanistan and Iran, Dara Shikoh was eventually caught by Mirja Raja Jai ​​Singh (a former loyalist of Shah Jahan) and brought back to Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>. He was put on trial under Sharia law and beheaded for being a "murtad" (apostate), largely due to his book "Meeting of Two Oceans" which discussed different religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.
    *   **Shah Shuja**: He was driven by [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]'s forces deep into Bengal and then beyond into the Arakan region (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma border), where a strong hypothesis suggests he and his family were captured and eaten by cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
    *   **Murad**: [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]] later imprisoned his brother Murad, who died of an opium overdose, likely induced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
    *   **Muhammad Sultan**: Even [[aurangzeb_and_his_rule | Aurangzeb]]'s own eldest son, Muhammad Sultan, who sided with Shah Shuja, was imprisoned and died of depression at age 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### Torture Methods
Mughal rulers employed various brutal torture methods:
*   Blinding with salt water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   Forced consumption of opium-seed-based "post" drinks, leading to addiction and eventual death, as seen with Suleiman Shikho, Dara Shikho's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   Imprisonment with venomous snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   Attaching spiked iron balls to the trunks of opium-fed wild elephants and releasing them into enemy ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## [[the_socioeconomic_conditions_of_india_before_shivajis_empire | Socioeconomic Conditions and Public Sentiment]]
Before [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s empire began to form, India was largely living in fear and suffering, especially in the North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Invasions, looting of temples, mass killings, and the taking of women and children as chattel or sex slaves were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This long period of oppression (around 800 years) led to a loss of self-esteem and a "servitude mentality" among the Indian populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. People lived in constant insecurity, fearing unpredictable "Sultani calamity" (raids by invaders) and "Asmani calamity" (natural disasters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The Portuguese in Goa also inflicted similar brutalities, converting locals and torturing those who refused to change their religion, dress, or lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This pervasive fear and suffering created an environment where the common person had no vision beyond survival, unlike the powerful rulers who were focused on wealth and dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. It was into this complex and challenging environment that [[chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj_and_his_philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] was born, aiming to create his own 'Swaraj' (self-rule) against such a formidable and ruthless adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

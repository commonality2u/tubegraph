Discussions on [[relationships_and_the_idea_of_marriage | marriage and relationships]] highlight the complexities of partnership, influenced by evolving societal norms, individual growth, and communication styles. The conversation touches upon the reasons for marital breakdowns, the impact of changing [[expectations_in_relationships | expectations]], and the profound significance of genuine connection.

## Reasons for Marital Separation
After 25 years of marriage, couples might seek separation due to a "complete transformation" in one or both partners [01:36:04]. The influence of social media can lead to altered [[expectations_in_relationships | expectations]], where one partner might desire to live a certain way, such as celebrating a 40th birthday with a destination holiday, which the other didn't bargain for [01:30:34], [01:36:11]. This shift can make a person feel they "didn't marry this guy" or vice-versa, leading to the realization that they are married to the "wrong person" [01:36:22], [01:37:15]. Some marriages have reportedly broken because a spouse married the partner's best friend, who "has not changed" unlike their own spouse [01:36:28], [01:36:48].

One perspective suggests that getting married younger allows for greater flexibility to change before individual eccentricities become too deeply set [01:23:15], [01:23:22]. Marriage often requires losing "a lot of yourself" and compromising beliefs and lifestyle, which is easier when less "crusted in your eccentricities" [01:23:32], [01:23:52]. Older generations, by contrast, might have a very fixed idea of an appropriate partner based on career, friend circle, domestic life, and financial dreams, narrowing their options until everything seems like a compromise [01:25:00], [01:25:25].

Ultimately, [[relationships_and_the_idea_of_marriage | marriage]] cannot be merely a business deal or an opportunity; it must be the "union of two souls" [01:34:41], [01:34:46].

## The Impact of Social Media on Relationships
The post-social media era has brought about a new generation where "everybody's empowerment came" [00:30:21]. This shift, while positive in many ways, has also changed people's personalities [00:30:27]. This "game change in culture" through social media has overexposed individuals to information, cultural acceptances, and polarity, leading to situations where the person one married feels completely different [01:37:24], [01:37:33].

Older men, for instance, might find themselves feeling lonely because the "new age concepts are being driven in" and their conditioning is changing [01:31:34], [01:31:37]. They might find more relatability among male friends (bros) than with their families, as children are now aware of concepts like "child abuse" and may not tolerate traditional forms of discipline [01:31:49], [01:31:53], [01:32:05]. This forces them to change themselves at 40 [01:32:17], leading to feelings of being "completely out in the wind" [01:37:44].

## The Importance of Respect and Communication
A successful [[relationships_and_the_idea_of_marriage | marriage]], such as R. Madhavan's, is characterized by a "great amount of intrinsic respect" for each other [01:22:34]. The partner is seen as an "equal partner" rather than someone privileged to be with a celebrity [01:22:44]. Expressing appreciation for one's partner, not just on special occasions like Women's Day or Valentine's Day, but "out of the blue," makes it more impactful [01:26:28], [01:26:32], [01:26:35].

Emotional [[the_importance_of_communication_and_storytelling_in_intimacy | communication]] is crucial, especially when dealing with [[aging_parents | aging parents]] [01:16:55], [01:16:59]. Past generations may not have been taught to "emotionally overcommunicate" [01:16:59]. Madhavan made a conscious effort to "overcommunicate" and hug his parents, who were not used to public displays of affection [01:18:13], [01:18:15].

## The Power of Hugs and Intimacy
Hugging is described as a "very primal requirement" for every person, providing a sense of grounding [01:18:51], [01:18:56]. The best relationships, including romantic ones and close friendships, often form out of "great first hugs" because "you can feel the soul of a person" [01:20:21], [01:20:27], [01:20:44]. Silent, unprovoked, and agenda-free hugs are particularly impactful, representing a "body grounding" connection without words [01:20:58], [01:21:07].

The unique bond between a grandchild and grandparent is highlighted as the "only next close thing to blood that they can hug" publicly, as parents often stop hugging their own children once they become adolescents [01:19:32], [01:19:46]. This desire for physical affection plays a role in why grandparents often wish for their children to have grandchildren [01:19:56], [01:19:58].

## Loneliness and Adaptation in Adulthood
A common challenge is "loneliness in your 40s" [00:29:35]. The belief that life with family and friends will be nice might not align with reality [00:29:45]. This [[psychology_in_relationships | loneliness]] can stem from the pressure to adapt to new societal norms and information overload, making individuals feel that their familiar ways of life are now considered "wrong" [01:31:19], [01:31:40], [01:32:47]. The need to navigate a world where a casual compliment can be deemed offensive or where new "rules of the game" exist in social interactions can be disorienting [00:33:00], [00:33:10], [00:34:01], [00:34:16].

For men, a strong support system of "bros" is crucial for [[psychology_in_relationships | mental health]], providing a space to vent and have unfiltered conversations [00:34:44], [00:34:56], [00:35:12], [00:35:17]. These connections allow for sharing thoughts and feelings that might be filtered in other aspects of life due to new norms [00:35:00], [00:35:19].

## Overcoming Challenges and Personal Growth
Like marriage, [[the_impact_of_relationships_on_personal_growth | relationships]] in general involve navigating challenges. The host's experience of [[overcoming_heartbreak_and_personal_struggles | heartbreak]] and academic failure in college, which led to suicidal thoughts, is viewed as life's way of preparing him for future downfalls [00:54:49], [00:55:10], [00:55:49], [00:57:00]. This experience taught him that he could go to the "pits of it and have come back," transforming failure into a valuable "sword" or "most important weapon" for dealing with future challenges [00:57:12], [00:57:54], [00:57:57]. Madhavan shares a similar experience with a film project that almost failed, where a friend advised him that giving up at that stage would make him give up even earlier on future challenges, leading to smaller successes [00:58:26], [00:58:57], [00:59:03]. These experiences highlight the importance of perseverance and the lessons learned from setbacks [00:59:28], [00:59:39].

The film *3 Idiots* is referenced for its iconic scene where a character confronts his father about pursuing a dream different from traditional expectations [00:56:19], [00:56:34]. This resonated with many who faced similar [[challenges_and_pressures_of_living_up_to_family_expectations | family expectations]] regarding career paths [00:56:38], [00:56:45].

[[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | Priyanka Chopra's]] entrepreneurial venture with her hair care brand Anomaly marks a significant phase in her career, evolving from acting and investments to founding her own brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This step is seen as a major move in her professional trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## The Genesis of Entrepreneurship

Chopra's interest in entrepreneurship began around the age of 30, influenced by her mother, a doctor and entrepreneur who had built her own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Her mother's advice to plan for the future, given the perceived limited "shelf life" for actresses in Bollywood after 30, spurred Chopra to consider starting her own ventures, such as movie production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This marked her initial dive into understanding the business side of entertainment, learning about production costs, recovery, and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Her journey expanded to investments after working in America, where her manager, a venture capitalist, sparked her interest in tech investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. She started with small investments, which grew significantly, notably bringing Bumble to India. This experience highlighted the power of new ideas, especially when they cater to a market gap and empower women, as Bumble did by creating a safe space for women to make the first move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The success of Bumble in India, even in tier-three and tier-four cities, demonstrated the impact of well-executed ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

## From Investments to Founding a Brand: Anomaly

Anomaly is [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions | Priyanka Chopra's]] first self-founded brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. She partnered with Maesa, who are market leaders in incubating new beauty brands, and Nykaa for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. The brand's development involved a year and a half of research, testing products on friends, family, and her team, and meticulous planning down to details like font, color, and scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

### Anomaly's Unique Proposition

Anomaly's success is attributed to its "trifecta" of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>:
*   **Sustainability:** All packaging is made from 100% recycled trash, including ocean-bound plastic and landfill waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This cost-saving in packaging allows for investment in excellent formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
*   **Clean Formulas:** The products are formulated without harmful ingredients commonly found in shampoos, such as sulfates, silicones, and mineral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Affordability:** Anomaly aims to provide high-quality products at an accessible price point, catering to the aspirational and health-conscious Indian consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity:** Challenging traditional marketing that differentiates between men's and women's hair care, Anomaly is designed for anyone with hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

Upon its launch with Nykaa, Anomaly sold one product every seven seconds on its first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. Within three months, it became one of the top 10 hair care brands on Nykaa, out of hundreds of brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Chopra views her entrepreneurial journey as a continuous process of growth and learning, emphasizing that success comes from consistent work and creating achievable dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. She believes in "manufacturing gold" through diligent effort rather than an instantaneous Midas touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Her work with Anomaly is seen as just the beginning of her business career, with potential for significant future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

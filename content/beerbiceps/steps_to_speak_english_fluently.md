This article outlines five simple steps to improve spoken English, drawing from personal experience and observations. The advice emphasizes making the learning process enjoyable and practical, focusing on fundamental aspects of communication rather than just vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Ranveer's Perspective on English
Despite producing vast amounts of digital content, Ranveer admits that languages are a significant weakness for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, English has always been his "thinking language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. His apparent fluency stems from clarity of thought and [[building_confidence_in_speaking_english | confidence]] in front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He has applied similar methods to [[overcoming_language_learning_challenges | improve his spoken Hindi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The core philosophy is to make the process easy and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Five Simple Steps

### Step 1: Engage with Enjoyable Content
Instead of traditional methods like watching news or joining classes, the first step is to enjoy the language learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This means integrating English practice into your daily routine for a minimum of 15 minutes, up to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

Choose content that you genuinely enjoy:
*   **Easy video content:** Cartoons are highly recommended because the language used is simple and designed for easy comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. If cartoons don't appeal, consider sports commentary, especially from Indian commentators like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, or Harsh Bhogle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Audio content:** If you prefer listening, engage with radio or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Simple English reading:** Pick up an ICSE 10th standard textbook, which often contains short stories, as some people learn languages better through reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

The key is to find what you enjoy most and practice it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Observe Sentence Construction
Once a consistent practice habit is established, the next focus is to observe English from an external perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Initially, the goal is not to improve vocabulary or learn complex words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Focus on Sentence Structure
> Pay close attention to how sentences are constructed by native or fluent speakers in the content you consume. Note how their sentence structures differ from your own thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Make a mental note of these differences and, if possible, practice saying the correct construction 10 times to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Understanding how English is spoken comes before expanding vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Put Your Ego Aside
Many Indians associate English proficiency with intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This societal perception can lead to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. However, when someone mocks your English, they are often projecting their own insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Embrace Mistakes
> It is perfectly acceptable to make mistakes when speaking English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. If others point out your errors, you are more likely to remember and correct them, leading to [[improving_communication_skills | improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. The focus should be on personal growth and becoming the best version of yourself, not on what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Chase Clarity of Thought
A common challenge is the mental translation process from one's native language to English, often compounded by anxiety about judgment ("what will people think?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

> [!info] Meditation for Clarity
> [[studying_for_selfimprovement | Meditation]] is recommended as a powerful tool to clear the mind and ground thought processes, directly contributing to clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This skill is beneficial for every aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

### Step 5: Stop Giving English Too Much Importance
The association of English with intelligence is a significant societal flaw in India, a remnant of 200 years of British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This [[cultural_perceptions_of_english_in_india | mentality]] is largely unique to India; in other countries like Germany or Japan, people primarily speak their native languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Be proud of your own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. It is not a major issue if you don't speak English perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. If you get stuck while speaking English, complete your sentences in your native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. The younger generation in India is becoming more accepting of mixing languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Current Relationship Status and Loneliness
[[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities]] confirmed that she is currently single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. While she is happy being single, she admits to feeling lonely at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. She clarifies that her loneliness is not connected to her physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. Instead, she attributes it to past experiences, which have led her to guard her energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. She feels she has "wasted too much of [her] energy on people that didn't deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

### Why She Isn't Approached
The host expressed surprise that [[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities]] is not approached for dates more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities]] speculates that a reason for this might be the modern accessibility of intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. She observes that convenience makes people "too scared to commit" and "too intimidated by intimacy," preventing them from forming "a real equation with anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

> "Intimacy has become so accessible. It's very convenient to get it whenever they want it and then also makes people too scared to commit to it... They're too intimidated by intimacy and they also have access to it at their convenience which which keeps them away from ever forming a real equation with anyone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>

## Hopes for a Future Partner
When asked what she would like to say to her future boyfriend, [[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities]] simply wished for him to "be nice to me and make me laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. She describes herself as someone who "will be good to you, I'll be there for you, I'll make you laugh, you'll have a lot of fun with me, and I can be cute, a little psycho but also cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## Priorities and Future Focus
Currently, [[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities]] is prioritizing her career and personal growth over a romantic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

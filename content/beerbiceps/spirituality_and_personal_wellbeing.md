Personal wellbeing, particularly for individuals in demanding professions like acting, is deeply intertwined with concepts of inner peace and [[spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]]. Despite external success, many grapple with an underlying sense of emptiness or a void, highlighting that true happiness is not solely derived from achievements or fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Inner Peace
The speaker notes that complete happiness is an elusive state, and a "void" will always be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Instead, conscious effort is placed on enjoying the small things in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This includes simple pleasures like eating a bag of chips with friends, dressed comfortably without makeup, a stark contrast to public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

For the speaker, the primary void in life is the search for peace, regardless of circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This is challenging due to the constant hustle of a career, which often means working without traditional weekends and feeling a lack of control over external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. There is a common perception that reaching a certain point in one's career will bring happiness or peace, but experience shows that fame and wealth often add to the "craziness" and make it harder to achieve inner tranquility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Peace, ultimately, is an "inside job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

## Overcoming External Pressures and Insecurity
The entertainment industry, particularly for actors, comes with significant external pressures:
*   **Lack of Privacy** There is very little privacy for public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability, not Invincibility** Becoming an actor, rather than making one "invincible," actually increases vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Moral Policing** Actors face immense moral policing and constant scrutiny of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Every step is taken with the consideration of "what will people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Image Expectations** There is an exhausting expectation to always be presentable, regardless of personal health or emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This includes being expected to oblige for selfies even when sick or going through trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

Actors who are self-made often experience deep-rooted insecurity despite their success, which can sometimes fuel their creativity if channeled well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The speaker, however, attempts to remain grounded and connected to her pre-fame self, not wanting to change despite the acquisition of "name, fame, money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## The Role of [[Concepts of spirituality and meditation | Spirituality and Meditation]]
After experiencing COVID-19 and a significant reality check, the speaker's perspective on life shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. The fast pace of life, trying to do "10 things in a day," had to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. The focus transitioned from long-term goals (like 10 years down the line) to being present and aware of each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

### Existentialism and Inner Purpose
The question of "where is my life going?" or "why am I doing this?" often arises, especially after achieving career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Spiritual schools often suggest that the answer to existentialism lies in spiritual practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. The speaker believes that to answer the question of "who am I," one needs to stop obsessing and "try too hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Things like sleep and peace happen when one just chills and goes with the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### [[Personal development through spiritual discipline and selfcare | Practices for Wellbeing]]
*   **Yoga:** While not a direct path to peace, yoga has taught the speaker about *ahimsa* (non-violence) towards oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Being harsh on oneself, such as forcing a yoga posture, is detrimental and reflects how one treats others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Ayurveda:** Embracing ancient wisdom like Ayurveda has led to significant personal changes, including learning to chew food slowly and practicing oil pulling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This shift, including becoming a vegetarian, helped reduce aggression and agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Ayurveda helps in seeking balance in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Meditation:** Meditation is seen as "intermittent fasting for the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. It helps in reconnecting with an "omnipresent" higher power or universe, by focusing on one thing to quiet the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Being Present:** The goal of [[spirituality_meditation_and_maintaining_a_positive_aura | spirituality and meditation]] is to achieve a state of "nothingness" where the mind is not constantly thinking, but rather fully in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. This applies even to daily activities like an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
*   **Gratitude:** The COVID-19 experience reinforced the importance of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Conscious effort is made to thank those who are pivotal in one's life, as many achievements are not possible without the help of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Karma and Rebirth
The concept of karma is firmly believed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. While the concept of rebirth is less understood, the speaker acknowledges the strange connections felt with strangers, suggesting a possible link to past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. [[Role of manifestation and spirituality in success | Spirituality and success]] is also linked, as being spiritually aligned can expand creativity and lead to more ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

> "The world of spirituality does believe in the concept of rebirth where it's like at the end of your life depending on how much Karma you've accumulated or how much you've up in life you're either given a better existence or a worse existence and at some point you work your way up to such a better existence that you get what they call Mukti or Enlightenment or what Buddha went through what mahavir went through what all these Saints go through but that's a long very long path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Karma is not just about actions, but also about thoughts; even thoughts can hold good or bad karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## Learnings for Wellbeing
*   **Take Action:** There is no "right time"; the right time is always now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Experiencing things teaches more than just reading about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Try Too Hard:** Pushing things too much often makes them move further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Seize Every Moment to Be Happy:** Focus on small things that bring happiness, as bigger things are often out of one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Care and Self-Love:** It is crucial to "cut ourselves some slack" and not be too harsh on oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Learning to love oneself is foundational, as one cannot love others without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

Ultimately, [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | spirituality and personal wellbeing]] is about understanding one's own journey and finding individual paths to contentment and peace.

Priyanka Chopra, a prominent figure in entertainment, shares her insights on navigating fame, public perception, and maintaining her authenticity amidst scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Public Magnetism and Handling Opinions

The host observes that while other Bollywood celebrities often face mixed public opinions, [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions|Priyanka Chopra]] is widely beloved across age, gender, and caste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. Chopra, however, humbly states she doesn't believe this to be entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Despite this, the host emphasizes her "super magnetic" presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Chopra attributes this magnetism not to an in-born trait, but to cultivated [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions|confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. She views [[Priyanka Chopras career journey and ambitions|confidence]] as something that can be taught and developed, a lesson she learned from her mother and other strong family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, underscoring the [[impact_of_upbringing_and_family_on_priyanka_chopras_life|impact of her upbringing and family]]. She also asserts that "haters don't exist in my life," indicating a strong personal boundary against negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

On the subject of social media, Chopra acknowledges that it can be both beneficial and harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. While its original purpose was to connect people, it has become a platform for targeting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. She receives "so many opinions" from people, both positive and negative, but chooses not to succumb to the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. This perspective aligns with her broader approach to [[dealing_with_fame_media_perceptions_and_public_scrutiny|dealing with public attention]].

## Maintaining Privacy and Grace Under Fire

As a public person, Chopra recognizes that her life could easily be an "open book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. However, she prefers to keep certain aspects of her life private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. She likens herself to a duck, paddling furiously below the surface while appearing calm and low-key on the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. This metaphor encapsulates her philosophy of "Grace Under Fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

For Chopra, maintaining dignity and grace is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. She rejects the idea of being a victim in her struggles, preferring to find her own solutions, regardless of their perceived success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. This resilience also extends to her [[priyanka_chopras_approach_to_mental_health|approach to mental health]], where she emphasizes finding support rather than suffering alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

Chopra aspires to leave behind a significant legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. She wishes for her children to be proud of her and for people to acknowledge that she "made a dent in my art, in entertainment, in my profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The host notes that many Indians already view her as "our girl," recognizing her profound impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Her background from a small town in India, growing up in Bareilly and Jamshedpur with Punjabi roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, fuels her belief that her achievements can inspire anyone with perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. She hopes to be remembered as a global legend, not just a national one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

> "I want them to say that I left behind a legacy... I want people to say that I made a dent in my art, in entertainment, in my profession... that actually through every facet of my life, whether it was my acting, my producing, my philanthropy, just being a girl..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>

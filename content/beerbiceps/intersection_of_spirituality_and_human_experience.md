From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Spirituality, particularly through the lens of Sanatan Dharma and Tantra, offers a profound perspective on the human experience, viewing life as a dynamic interplay between free will and destiny, governed by fundamental forces and desires. It suggests that every individual, regardless of their background or beliefs, contributes to and is shaped by a larger spiritual reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:46">[06:00:46]</a>.

## Defining Spirituality and Deities

In Sanatan Dharma, the concept of [[exploring_personal_spiritual_journeys | spirituality]] is broad, offering various paths and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Deities are central to this understanding, representing different facets of the divine.

### Mahakal and Shiva
Mahakal is described as the highest form of Bav, embodying time personified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. There is no fundamental difference between Shiva and Bav; it is merely the Maya of Shiva that makes them appear distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.
*   **Shiva**: Represented as the auspicious, peaceful, and calm form, often depicted with Parvati and their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>. Shiva is the personification of the static state of realization, bringing peace and detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>.
*   **Bav**: An aggressive, intense form of Shiva, deeply connected to cremation grounds and the forces of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. He controls the manner and timing of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.
*   **Kalabav**: The primary form of Bav, who manifested from Shiva's anger to cut off Brahma's fifth head for arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. Kalabav is a deity who sustains, creates, and can destroy sins, washing away karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>. He guards Kashi, ensuring who is fit to enter its luminous state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. Kalabav can also scare death, making individuals fearless of circumstances and life itself, fostering [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | detachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>.
*   **Mahakal**: The highest form of Bav, representing the "Last Frontier of your imagination," the very edge of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He can take any shape or form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a>.

Deities like Mahakal attract powerful individuals and masses, as seen with public figures visiting temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02">[01:45:02]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that even when a deity might seem "asleep" or less active, its energy can be reawakened through the birth of great spiritual practitioners who connect to and spread their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

## The Human Experience

Human experience is a complex interplay of inner states, external circumstances, and spiritual forces.

### Free Will, Destiny, and Karma
The balance between free will and destiny is intricate and difficult for an average individual to discern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. While certain aspects of life, like birth and death, are believed to be fixed (`Dridh Karmas`), many circumstances are fluid and can be changed through effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>.
*   **Karma**: Actions create a feedback loop, generating [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | momentum]] in the mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. This includes `samcaras` (tendencies from past births) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Nature's Role**: Nature provides intelligence and circumstances, expecting humans to act within their capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>. Only a small percentage of people, through [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | sadhana]], expand their minds to question deeper realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Dreams and Higher Realities
Dreams offer a glimpse into different levels of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>:
*   **Subconscious Dreams**: About 60% of dreams come from the subconscious mind, reflecting daily interactions and thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
*   **Acknowledging Reality**: Some dreams reveal realities that the conscious mind refuses to acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Lower Astral Plane**: Dreams from this realm can be accurate and manifest quickly (within days or a month), but can also be changed with corrective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Planes**: The rarest dreams come from beyond the astral planes, where gods and higher realities reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. These dreams take years to manifest but are unchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. They often appear to those in [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | sadhana]] or with a [[spirituality_meditation_and_mental_health_in_modern_life | spiritual]] bent of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.

### The Influence of Desires: Sex, Money, and Power
These three are considered the most powerful `shakti` (forces) governing everything in human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>:
*   A man who goes beyond these three is considered a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   They function like chakras, driving human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:21">[02:00:21]</a>.
*   Desire for "more" of these things leads to corruption of discrimination, mistakes, and ultimately disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:15">[02:12:15]</a>.
*   Lust, power, and money will corrupt humans if handled infinitely, leading to self-injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:18">[02:12:18]</a>. Morality and ethics exist to keep these in balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>.

### Reincarnation and the "Earthly Playground"
Earth is viewed as a "playground of possibilities" where all shades of good and evil are allowed to play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:42">[02:00:42]</a>.
*   **Lower Beings**: Individuals can be reincarnations of beings from lower realms. These often manifest as tremendously evil individuals like Stalin or Hitler, causing mass damage and horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. They are influenced by negative entities that exploit cravings for money, sex, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:42">[01:51:42]</a>. Even these beings pray for more power, as seen with `Asuras` in `shastras` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.
*   **Higher Beings**: Higher beings can also be born on Earth, often manifesting as artistic geniuses (e.g., musicians like Beethoven or Mozart) or possessing exceptional talent that cannot be imitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:46">[01:54:46]</a>. They may not know they are higher beings due to Maya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. Despite their gifts, they may face adjustment issues and unhappy lives due to their unfamiliarity with human existence, often exhibiting challenging behaviors like rudeness or loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:09">[01:59:09]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The Earthly realm offers the fastest pace for [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual growth]] and transformation due to its finite lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>. It's a place to determine one's desired evolution and face the consequences of karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>.

### Attachments and Relationships
Any strong attachment, such as to money, can create a problematic impact on the mind, leading to suffering when loss occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. The ability to switch from attachment to [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | detachment]] is a mark of a great human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">[01:47:55]</a>. Romantic love is considered one of the greatest attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>. From a Tantric perspective, love is more about [[spirituality_and_personal_relationships | spiritual companionship]] and mutual support in practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

## Tantra's Approach to Human Experience

Tantra offers a unique path to [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual growth]] that diverges from some other Vedantic philosophies.

### Embracing Maya
Unlike philosophies that view Maya (the illusory material world) as something to be rejected, Tantra considers it the very body of the Mother, a constricted manifestation of the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>.
*   The goal in Tantra is to see through the illusion and find the larger manifestation of the divine within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:12">[01:44:12]</a>.
*   Tantra encourages appreciation of what nature has given, rather than rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a>. This includes natural tendencies like eating meat or engaging in sex within limits, which are considered good things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:14">[01:45:14]</a>.
*   The philosophy aims to find the "germ of [[exploring_personal_spiritual_journeys | spirituality]]" even within things that might be deluding, using these very things for ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>.
*   The first principle of Tantra is that the Divine is all around, and the practitioner's job is to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>.

### Disciplined Use of Desires
While embracing desires, Tantra emphasizes disciplined and specific use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>. This contrasts with traditional yoga, which advocates for restriction and brahmacharya (complete abstinence from sex) to awaken inner power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Dakshinachara Tantra**: The "right-hand path" of Tantra involves restrictions on food and physical intimacy, but allows the use of mantras and yantras in a `satvic` (pure) manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Vamachara Tantra**: The "left-hand path" enters a stage where `panchatatva` (meat, fish, alcohol) must be offered to the deity and consumed as `Prasad` (sanctified offering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>. This path tests the practitioner's ability to attain perfection in both light and dark, satvic and non-satvic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>. The consumption of `Prasad` is crucial, as refusal is seen as insulting the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Sanctified Alcohol**: Alcohol, when purified through mantras and processes, becomes `Karan` (sanctified) and is offered to the Mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. It's meant to be consumed in a controlled, disciplined way, not for intoxication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Tobacco/Cigarettes**: While some Kalabav temples offer tobacco or cigarettes, this practice has no basis in traditional `shastras` and is likely a local development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Spiritual Progress and Power
Tantra emphasizes the acquisition and application of power for [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | spiritual advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.
*   **Power as Divine**: Tantra considers power divine, with Mahashakti as its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.
*   **Accelerating Activity**: Tantra is a method of accelerating an activity to attain perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.
*   **Prasadhas**: Tantra scriptures specifically mention `prasadhas` (applications of power), asserting that one must demonstrate power, not just claim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This power can be used to protect oneself, community, or country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Shortcuts**: Genuine [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] and power do not come quickly or for free. Shortcuts, like bribing or worshipping negative entities for quick gains, lead to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>.

## Spiritual Practices and Their Impact

[[Spiritual practices and transformation | Sadhana]] involves deliberate effort to connect with the divine, leading to profound changes in human experience.
*   **Initiation (`Diksha`)**: For full Tantra sadhana, an initiation (`Diksha`) by a qualified guru is required. This is a Puja performed to remove obstacles and ensure the practitioner's path to worshipping deities is smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Mantra Chanting**: Chanting mantras is a way to connect to a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:35">[01:43:35]</a>.
*   **Meditation**: For deities like Mahakal, meditation is considered more fruitful than mantra sadhana alone for those capable of deep concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:42">[01:43:42]</a>.
*   **Transformation**: Sadhana is a transformative process. Simply visiting a temple is different from engaging in sadhana, which aims to change the practitioner and, in turn, changes the deity's perspective towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It can be like putting one's hand into a tornado, testing capacity and steadfastness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:38">[01:48:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:53">[01:48:53]</a>.
*   **Energy Exchange**: Spiritual conversations and recordings for [[incorporating_spirituality_in_living_spaces | spiritual purposes]] involve an energy drain from the speaker, as they infuse their life force to create lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This energy is replenished through daily practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## The Purpose of Suffering
The pursuit of [[spirituality_meditation_and_mental_health_in_modern_life | spiritual]] enlightenment in Sanatan Dharma aims to transcend suffering completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. Humans are in this "playground" of existence to learn and evolve. Even if one never suffers, the moment of death will involve some pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:35">[02:22:35]</a>. By engaging in upasana (worship) of deities, individuals can transcend qualities that cause suffering and become a reflection of the deity, who are beyond such pains and are eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:10">[02:23:10]</a>.

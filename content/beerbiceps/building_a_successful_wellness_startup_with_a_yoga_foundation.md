Sva Shashi, a prominent young entrepreneur in India, attributes his success, including building a multi-million dollar business, to his long-term practice of celibacy and deep training in yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His approach integrates ancient yogic principles with modern business practices to create a thriving wellness ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Wellness Ecosystem: SVA and Diva Yoga

Sva Shashi's primary venture is **Diva Yoga**, described as one of India's biggest wellness startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Diva Yoga** is an all-women, aspirational brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   The mother brand, **SVA**, means "all complete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Its vision statement is "connecting 7 billion breaths," aiming to build a unisex, transformational wellness ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   The authentic foundation of the business is yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Notable Investors
Over 40 individuals have invested in the wellness ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, including:
*   Jennifer Lopez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Alex Rodriguez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Malika Arora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Shahid Kapoor and Meera Kapoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Aishwarya Dhanush (Rajinikanth's daughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>

When people invest, they primarily look at the founder, the business's purposeful and scalable nature, and the team, in addition to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## The Founder's Journey: Yoga, Discipline, and Celibacy

Sva Shashi's personal journey significantly influenced his business success. He describes his life in two parts: before and after the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Prior to 17, his life was characterized by "arrogance, attitude, and anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. His parents enrolled him in yoga classes at age six to help him balance and focus, initially for his cricket game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

His deeper [[spiritual_and_yogic_lifestyle_and_its_impact_on_intuition | yoga journey]] began at 17 when he took over his father's uncompleted yoga classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He was intrigued by enlightenment and consciousness, initially with a selfish desire to develop intuition for his cricket career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. His teacher, whom he calls Guruji (one who brings from darkness to light), emphasized that enlightenment is not something someone else can bestow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### The Five Precepts (Sadas)
After engaging in various 'sadas' (disciplines like 40 days of silence, 9 hours of daily meditation, Vipassana, and not touching people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, Sva's teacher gave him five core precepts to follow, which he committed to for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He noted that every time he completed a 'sada,' he advanced in his life, professionally or in his cricket game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He has followed these for 9 years and continues to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The five precepts are:
1.  **No Intoxication**: No alcohol, no smoking, no non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words. The belief is a deed is done when the thought is planted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing**: Neither physical nor mental stealing (e.g., coveting others' possessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Even white lies are avoided. If late, he states the true reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy (Brahmacharya)**: This was the most difficult due to his age and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It means no sex, no fap, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Initially, for about 1.5 years, he followed these precepts to prove his teacher wrong, but after that, it became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Semen Retention and Yogic Practices

Sva Shashi emphasizes that the combination of these practices, particularly semen retention, has provided significant benefits:

### Enhanced Energy and Creativity
[[kundalini_and_kriya_yoga_practices | Semen retention]] means taking that energy upwards to the brain instead of releasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This opens up a completely different dimension of creative thought processes and right brain activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This creative energy enhances performance in professional life, sports, and even general confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. He encourages trying it for 21 days to experience the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

> [!info] Tip: Channelizing Sexual Energy
> When feeling lustful, sit down, take a deep breath, and visualize the energy flowing upwards through your spine into your brain. As you breathe out, imagine that energy spreading throughout your brain. This simple [[kundalini_and_kriya_yoga_practices | yoga]] visualization technique helps redirect sexual energy into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Advanced meditation schools teach specific yogas to control and re-channel sexual energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### Increased Magnetism and Changed Attraction
Semen retention can make a person more attractive and magnetic, possibly due to energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The definition of attraction changes, moving beyond superficial physical appearance to compassion and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Sva points out that a common exercise in Vipassana meditation involves observing one's internal sensations and reactions when attracted to someone, questioning why the sensation goes to sexual organs instead of the heart, and why feelings of compassion or empathy don't arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

While he acknowledges sex as a beautiful act that creates new life, he questions the motivation behind it â€“ whether it's for a momentary physical pleasure or a deeper connection with a singular person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. He believes that the thoughts and feelings of a couple during sex, especially when trying to conceive, are crucial as they imbue the child with a certain energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

Sva admits he still experiences lustful feelings but is conscious of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. He knows how to transform them into compassion and love for himself and the other person, leading to a sense of safety and trust from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Intuition and Manifestation
His adherence to non-lying and other precepts has led to instances where predictions he made came true, suggesting a form of unconscious manifestation or highly developed [[spiritual_and_yogic_lifestyle_and_its_impact_on_intuition | intuition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. He believes that nature conspires to make things happen for those who consistently practice these disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

Sva has never consciously used his intuition for his career, as spirituality, for him, means being in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. However, he acknowledges that everyone is intuitive and receives "vibes"; some people simply realize and act upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. He views what people call "coincidence" as a manifestation of prior thoughts or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

*   **Ajna Chakra**: The third eye, or Ajna Chakra, is the sixth chakra in the body and is associated with [[spiritual_and_yogic_lifestyle_and_its_impact_on_intuition | intuition]] and the sixth sense. Opening it requires various practices like energy work, pranayama, meditation, and yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Intoxicants and negative thoughts can block it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Meditation Practice
Sva practices Anapana of Vipassana, which involves focusing on the normal and natural flow of breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to be an observer of thoughts, allowing them to pass without involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This practice increases focus levels in waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. He states that one hour of yoga a day can sort one out for 23 hours, providing energy and reducing the need for excessive sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings for Success

Sva Shashi shares three crucial life learnings, incorporating his yogic principles, valuable for entrepreneurs and individuals alike:

1.  **Be True and Authentic to Yourself**: It's difficult, but essential to take the first step. Don't be overly influenced or bombarded by your environment or peer group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
2.  **Self-Care (Physical and Mental)**: This is vital. There's a thin line between being selfish and selfless. One must love and care for oneself before being able to genuinely care for others or build a successful business. A mix of physical activities (gym, functional training) and mindful practices (breathing, meditation) is recommended to come to the present and become a better version of oneself daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person**: Especially critical for entrepreneurs, effective people management is the most important skill for a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, so being a good employer and fostering love and trust within a team is paramount for retention and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

Sva's personal transformations inspired him to spread the message and start his yoga company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. His philosophy culminates in: "Love like there is no tomorrow and if Tomorrow Comes Love Again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

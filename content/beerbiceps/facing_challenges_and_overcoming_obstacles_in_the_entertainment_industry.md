The journey through the entertainment industry is often fraught with [[challenges_in_the_acting_profession | challenges]] and obstacles, requiring immense resilience and a clear perspective on success. This perspective evolves from a youthful, romanticized view of relentless work to a mature understanding of work-life balance and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Romanticized Work Ethic vs. Reality
Initially, the notion of success in the industry was often associated with an extreme work ethic: "work 24 hours, do four movies in one time, you know five shifts, don't sleep, don't eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This intense, non-stop approach was believed to guarantee success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, with experience, a shift in understanding occurred, recognizing that "having a work life balance is really important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Taking time for personal rejuvenation, like a trip to Turks and Caicos, allows for returning to work feeling "rejuvenated, feeling excited and really motivated to take my career forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

This refined approach emphasizes that "work can be your companion, work can be creative, work can be something that gives you Joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Achieving a work-life balance means being fully present in different aspects of life, whether working on multiple business verticals or spending time with family, which in turn fosters focus and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Navigating Career Shifts and Humility
Embarking on a career in a new country or segment of the entertainment industry presents significant [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | obstacles]]. Despite having an "incredible career" and "amazing credibility" in India, a transition to the American industry in 2010 meant "starting from scratch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. It took a decade, until 2020, to secure a first leading role in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

This journey demanded:
*   **Hard work and consistent effort:** "how much hard work how much consistent knocking on doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Extreme humility:** "required me to walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of smaller roles:** Initially, accepting "so many small roles in big movies in Hollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a> was necessary to gain a foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Patience:** Success takes time, and expecting immediate recognition based on past achievements in another market is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

The process of rebuilding a career required "sweat, tears and blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. A significant achievement was finally receiving the "same renumeration as a man," something that was never achieved in Bollywood despite extensive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Dealing with Negativity and Public Scrutiny
The path to success also involves [[emotional_and_psychological_challenges_of_acting | emotional and psychological challenges]], particularly in dealing with public perception and internal anxiety:
*   **Jealousy and sabotage:** There are individuals who actively try to "jeopardize my career, take away from work, make sure that I wasn't cast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. This often stems from a societal mindset where people are not happy for others' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   **Battling anxiety:** Concerns about "losing my job, losing my position, losing time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a> can cause significant stress.
*   **Public consumption:** Being a public figure means being "dinner table conversation every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a> and facing constant scrutiny, judgments, and opinions, many of which may be untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

To overcome these, the advice is to "shut off the noise" and instead "focus on the one person that believes in you, focus on the light, little sliver of light that you might see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. It's crucial to cultivate inner strength and "fight that fight for yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Belief and Positive Relationships
[[personal_journeys_and_overcoming_failure | Personal growth]] and the ability to overcome obstacles are deeply tied to self-empowerment and the people one chooses to keep close:
*   **Challenging societal norms:** Especially for women, it's vital to "take charge of their own lives" and "not fit into the cookie cutter mold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a> dictated by past generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Internal empowerment:** Empowerment "comes from you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. If external encouragement is lacking, one must "find it in your gut" because "no one's going to fix your life but you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Learning and inspiration:** Being open to learning from collaborators and finding inspiration in others' achievements helps in taking new steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Avoiding toxic influences:** "Do not hang around with poisonous people, do not keep people around you that are toxic that mess with your brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Instead, surround oneself with "Champions" who are "genuinely happy for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

Ultimately, defining one's own meaning of life and pursuing purpose, whether that involves creating a legacy or living a quiet, peaceful life, is a subjective choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. The pursuit should be focused on making choices that bring peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

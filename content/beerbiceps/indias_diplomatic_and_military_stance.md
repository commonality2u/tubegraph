India's security and [[Indias foreign policy and its relationship with the US and China | foreign policy]] have evolved significantly since its independence, driven by historical conflicts and a changing geopolitical landscape. The nation's approach to diplomacy and military strength is underpinned by its intelligence capabilities and a growing assertiveness on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>.

## Evolution of Intelligence and Security

At independence, India inherited systems from the British, primarily the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was responsible for both internal and external intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Intelligence is defined as gathering information about an adversary's plans, intentions, abilities, and likely moves to India's detriment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This includes collecting factual data, such as new military equipment or divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, and assessing political issues, like election outcomes in other countries and their attitude towards India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

However, the 1962 Chinese Invasion and the 1965 Pakistani Invasion highlighted deficiencies in India's intelligence gathering, particularly in anticipating threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The government recognized that one organization could not effectively manage both internal and external threats with full devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:26]</a>. This led to the formation of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) on September 21, 1968, dedicated solely to external threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

### RAW's Role and Capabilities

RAW's first major success was its role in the 1971 War with Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh. RAW assisted and trained the Mukti Bahini, the liberation fighters of Bangladesh, in their efforts to overthrow the Pakistani regime in Dhaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

Intelligence gathering methods include:
*   **Hard intelligence**: Based on documents, audio, imagery, and other factual proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   **Source-based intelligence**: Information from cultivated spies operating behind enemy lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. Communication methods have evolved from slow, routed exchanges to modern gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   **Topographical intelligence**: Mapping the topography of neighboring countries, which historically involved sending agents on the ground to collect data mile by mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Open sources**: Approximately 90% of total information comes from open sources accessible to everyone, such as Google Maps and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

Intelligence agencies also analyze collected information to predict the near future and next moves of adversaries, feeding this intelligence to the government and [[Role of the Indian Army in national and international contexts | military]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

## Modern Security Landscape

The meaning of security today is much wider than just military or political aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. It includes:
*   **Demography and Migrations**: Famine in a neighboring country leading to an influx of people can pose a potential security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.
*   **Water Shortage**: The biggest threat to a country is if its water supply is cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. The [[Indias foreign policy and its relationship with the US and China | Indus Waters Treaty]] with Pakistan is an example; Pakistan has adhered to it because it provides a favorable deal, receiving more water than stipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Re-evaluating this treaty to balance the 70/30 equation towards India is a diplomatic challenge, as Pakistan views any change as an act of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.
*   **Social Media and Narratives**: Social media is a weapon of collection and influence, used to psychologically impact populations and twist stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. India is likely a victim of Chinese and Pakistani intelligence agencies twisting narratives on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

## India's Current Stance and Global Perception

Under the [[Indias political landscape | current government]], India is perceived as safer and has cultivated a "tiger's branding" on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This is attributed to several factors:
*   **Delivery on Promises**: The government's visible efforts to deliver on promises for the common man, such as widespread use of PhonePe and access to gas cylinders and toilets, has improved internal stability and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Outreach**: India's relations with West Asian nations have significantly improved due to active outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.
*   **Assertive Military Response**: Actions like the Balakot counter-attack after the Pulwama incident sent a clear message of retaliation, changing the tone of regional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. This contrasts with the perceived inaction after the 2008 Mumbai attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
*   **Self-Confidence**: The willingness to stand up and respond militarily contributes to national pride and confidence, influencing how other nations view India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

This increased security is a combination of strengthening the security apparatus, including intelligence agencies and the [[Role of the Indian Army in national and international contexts | military]], and caring for the population they protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. The partnership between intelligence agencies (as data analysts and coaches) and the [[Role of the Indian Army in national and international contexts | military]] (as players) is a joint effort, despite occasional differences in assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. For instance, during the Kargil War, despite being caught unawares, there was an underlying belief that India would ultimately prevail, which it did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

## Geopolitical Narratives and India's Position

India, as a growing power, needs to understand how narratives are built and countered by states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Historically, India was often portrayed as a land of "snake charmers," while Western nations projected an image of superiority and democratic values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This narrative, suggesting India was nothing without Western influence, persisted for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

Short-term narratives are also constructed for specific purposes, such as the false claim of Saddam Hussein possessing WMDs to justify military intervention for oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. These narratives are spread globally, shaping public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Global Shifts

The world is seeing shifts in global power dynamics. Narratives from the West about countries like China being on the brink of civil war are often propaganda, underestimating the resilience of totalitarian states and their populations, similar to how Russia's resilience was underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

The U.S. dollar's dominance is facing pressure due to sanctions leading to alternative trading practices like rupee-ruble trade and discussions about a BRICS currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. While America remains a very strong country with technological and educational strengths, it needs to re-evaluate its approach and learn to coexist with other powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

India aims to develop its own internet infrastructure to avoid reliance on Western platforms, which gather vast amounts of data and can influence populations, potentially hindering independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

In conclusion, India's diplomatic and military stance is characterized by a strong, well-supported intelligence apparatus, a proactive military approach to threats, and a growing confidence in its global standing, enabling it to navigate complex geopolitical challenges.

Effective [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | scheduling]] and [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | time management]] are crucial, especially when balancing multiple demanding commitments like college and a burgeoning entrepreneurial venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Balancing Multiple Commitments

For college entrepreneurs, the challenge lies in managing attendance while consistently producing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Strict attendance requirements, such as maintaining at least 75% in college, necessitate completing all YouTube shoots within a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This means rushing home after college to work, sometimes not even being able to take a single day or half-day off in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Shoots might extend late into the night to meet deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

It is essential to make a proper schedule and prioritize tasks, determining what is important and dedicating time to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Both academic pursuits and entrepreneurial endeavors must be given equal importance, with a commitment to not compromise on either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Improved Efficiency and Academic Performance

Contrary to expectations, actively managing a YouTube channel alongside studies can lead to improved academic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This is because engaging in multiple activities forces individuals to optimize their time usage, teaching them to accomplish more in shorter periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. For example, a task that might take others six to seven hours can be completed in two hours due to the honed [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | efficiency]] from balancing commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | efficiency]] becomes a vital life skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

> "With balancing so much that in in in a shorter amount of time period you can actually get so much done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

## Developing Essential Life Skills

The demanding schedule fosters dedication and discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It pushes individuals to maximize their study time, even requiring all-night sessions before exams to complete necessary portions and ensure a thorough understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

> "If this is the portion and I'm supposed to completed then I'm supposed to complete it and I'm supposed to know each and every point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

This rigorous approach to managing time and tasks instills invaluable skills that extend beyond academics and business, contributing significantly to personal growth and the development of [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | a strong work ethic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Actress Kiara Advani has a significant interest in psychology, stemming from her academic background and influencing her approach to life and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Academic Pursuit
Kiara Advani studied psychology in her 11th and 12th grades as part of the humanities option available at her school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. She found the subject deeply interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Her curriculum included psychology, sociology, and the study of people's personalities, areas in which she "excelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. In her 12th grade, she achieved 92% and topped her school in psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Psychology as a Potential Career
For a brief period, Advani considered pursuing further studies in psychology abroad as a "plan B" if acting didn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. However, her passion for acting ultimately meant she prioritized her "plan A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Life and Career
Advani's study of psychology led her to initially feel as though she exhibited "every disorder in the book" because of how relatable the conditions felt when reading about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. She attributes this to the human tendency to possess "a little bit of all those feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The host of the Ranveer Show notes that psychology is a relevant life skill that helps one understand people and situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Advani agrees, expressing a wish that subjects like life skills, people skills, and psychology were taught more in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. She believes that earlier exposure to such knowledge would have helped her evolve into her current self much sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Psychology and Acting
Advani sees a connection between psychologists and actors, noting that both are observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Her experience with highly internalized characters, such as Preeti from *Kabir Singh*, taught her the "art of detachment" and the importance of being fully present in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. She feels that her emotional quotient is "very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, which can lead to deeper pain but also allows her to connect authentically with roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. She believes that truly "feeling" a scene on screen allows the audience to connect, unlike when an emotion is faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

## Observations on Relationships and People
Drawing from her understanding of psychology, Advani shares her perspective on relationships:
*   **Openness and Transparency** She is very open and transparent about her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. If she's upset, happy, excited, or "pissed off," it's visible on her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. She maintains the same personality whether with loved ones, her team, or when alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Importance of Mutual Feeling** In a relationship, she believes both individuals should make each other feel important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This doesn't mean putting someone on a pedestal or making them feel like a "queen," which she finds off-putting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Instead, it's about mutual respect, understanding, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Core Relationship Values** She emphasizes loyalty, trust, and respect as fundamental elements for both men and women in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **Acceptance and Growth** Advani stresses the importance of accepting a partner for who they are inherently, rather than trying to change them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. While people evolve, it should not be at the cost of changing someone's core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Understanding Intentions** She highlights that understanding the intention behind a person's behavior, even anger, can reduce disappointment in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Non-Judgmental Approach** Advani views herself as a non-judgmental person, preferring observation and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. She believes that not judging allows for deeper understanding of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

Her background in psychology has equipped her with strong people skills and the ability to understand others' headspaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, making her a keen observer of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The popular YouTube personality, known publicly as CarryMina, has discussed the significant [[Impact of fame on personal life and privacy | impact of fame]] on his private life and personal experiences, drawing a clear distinction between his public persona and his true self, Ajay Nagar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Public Persona vs. Private Self
Ajay Nagar views CarryMina as a public character, keeping that aspect of his identity "very open" for everyone to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, he considers Ajay Nagar to be a "very private person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He deliberately keeps aspects of his personal life private, believing he shouldn't share certain parts of himself, and maintains a strict boundary between the two identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. If he shares one private detail, he feels compelled to share others, leading him to keep his private life completely separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Challenges of Being a Famous Teenager
Being a famous teenager in India presents numerous challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Teenagers naturally engage in "stupid things" and enjoy parties and madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, when famous, many things "take over your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For CarryMina, this has meant missing out on basic life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   **Lack of basic skills** He doesn't know how to drive because he never had the time to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Missed life stages** He never experienced college life, which is a normal developmental stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The typical cycle of learning to walk, going to school, college, and then a job was broken for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Desire for relatable experiences** He acknowledges missing out on these experiences and expresses a desire to live in a hostel or shared flat to understand college life, primarily to create relatable content for his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Privacy and Personal Space
CarryMina has been an [[Impact of fame on personal life and privacy | introvert]] since childhood, preferring to stay at home and play games with friends rather than going out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. His room serves as his "world" where he works, plays games, and relaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This private space was where he built his successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

While he enjoys meeting people, he dislikes "unwanted things from anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A specific example is when he is out with his parents; he finds it awkward when fans use the same language or expletives in front of them that he uses in his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. He feels it's inappropriate to use such language in front of parents, despite his video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Dealing with Fame and Parental Perceptions
His parents are also learning to [[Dealing with fame and public scrutiny | deal with his fame]], experiencing it as something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Colleagues and friends of his parents call them, asking for introductions to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. They are all "learning together how to deal with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. While his parents don't personally object to the language in his videos, his mother sometimes suggests he avoid abusing mothers or sisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. When live-streaming, he often considers that his mother might be watching, which sometimes causes a sudden shock or change in his expression, even if he is otherwise very open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite his massive following, CarryMina states that he doesn't feel the pressure of his large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He mentally processes it as just a number and notes that when he does take on pressure, "things go wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

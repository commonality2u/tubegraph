[[Importance of focus for success | Focus]] is a deciding factor in achieving success in school, college, or a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. All individuals have the same amount of time in a week (7 days) and a day (24 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, successful individuals are not necessarily those who work the hardest, but rather those who can maintain maximum focus within minimal work minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The ability to be focused directly correlates with achieving good marks or financial success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Focus involves remaining in one place, disengaging from distractions, and concentrating on a single spot, thought, or work task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Enemies of Focus

While attempting to stay focused, certain "enemies of focus" can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These include:
*   Breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Bad marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Performance pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

These pains and worries are significant obstacles to being focused, as they make individuals "ungrounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The more grounded an individual is, the greater their ability to remain in one place and maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Therefore, improving one's grounding is a prerequisite for enhanced focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## How to Improve Grounding for Better Focus

### 1. Follow a Fitness Routine
The human body is designed for movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A lack of sufficient physical activity can lead to an excess amount of energy, which in turn makes an individual ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Engaging in physical activity to tire the body slightly helps balance hormones and energies, contributing to a sharper mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### 2. Choose the Correct Food
The body is a direct reflection of what is consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. While humans historically ate clean, fresh food for centuries, eating habits have drastically changed in the last 100 to 200 years, leading to the consumption of "packaged poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A diet high in additives and processed sugar can make individuals feel more ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Choosing to eat fresh food can lead to a significant positive change in one's mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### 3. Work Your Mind Muscle
Just like biceps can be strengthened through curls, the mind can also be trained to be more focused, grounded, and overall stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The simplest method to ground the mind is through breath-based [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. During [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]], sit comfortably with an erect back and solely concentrate on your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It is normal for the mind to wander, but the key is to consistently bring attention back to breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This process actively exercises the "focus muscle," teaching the mind to return to and concentrate on a single thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Engaging in 20 minutes of brain training through [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] can strengthen this "focus muscle." This strengthened mental capacity can then be applied to work tasks, as the focus required for a career is similar to the focus required for breath during [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For those serious about improving focus and maximizing human potential, [[meditation_for_enhancing_mental_focus | meditation]] is a direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

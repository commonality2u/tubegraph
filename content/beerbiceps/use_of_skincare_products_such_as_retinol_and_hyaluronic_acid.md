The field of dermatology has seen a surge in interest in advanced skincare treatments and active ingredients, partly driven by the increased availability of products and information, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. However, it's crucial to approach skincare with an understanding that it's not like fashion; applying the wrong product can cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.

## Skincare Regimen Essentials
Beyond the basics of washing the face twice a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>, a fundamental [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] should focus on three core principles:
1.  **Cleanse**: Choosing the correct cleanser is paramount, as it can significantly impact skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. For example, a brightening face wash with acids might harm dry skin, leading to further dryness, irritation, and even pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>. For those exposed to pollution or heavy makeup, a pre-cleanse with oil-soluble products or micellar water may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
2.  **Protect**: This involves shielding the skin from free radical damage, pollution, sun, and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. Sunscreen is a must for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. Modern sunscreen formulations protect against UV rays, visible light, and infrared rays, preventing inflammation and premature aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. A good [[moisturizers_and_natural_alternatives | moisturizer]] also offers protection against dust and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
3.  **Nourish**: This involves providing the skin with what it needs to quench and calm itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Key components for skin repair and protection include water, oil, and protein (peptides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. Nourishing ingredients can include licorice, calendula, or other beneficial substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

### Exfoliation
[[the_importance_of_exfoliation_and_skincare_routines | Exfoliation]] is a crucial step in a skincare routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. The distinction between "scrubbing" and "exfoliation" is important:
*   **Scrubbing**: This is a harsh, rough process using thick granules that can damage the skin, similar to using sandpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. It can disrupt the skin's microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Exfoliation**: This is a gentle loosening of the top dead layer of skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. It can be done physically with fine, round, smooth granules (e.g., rice powder, sugar-based scrubs used with a [[face_washing_routine_and_products | face wash]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>, or chemically using AHAs, BHAs, lactic acid, or salicylic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. Professional peels are also a form of chemical exfoliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
    *   Exfoliation can help achieve a fairer look by removing clumped melanin and dead keratin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.
    *   For [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]] patients with clogged pores, blackheads, and whiteheads, gentle exfoliation under a doctor's guidance can be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.
    *   Exfoliation should generally be done once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

## Specific Active Ingredients

### Retinol (Retinoic Acid / Isotretinoin)
Retinol, a derivative of Vitamin A, is one of the oldest and most studied anti-aging ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>.

#### How it Works
Retinol increases cell turnover and can change the DNA of basal cells to produce repaired, healthy cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>. This continuous regeneration makes the skin look fresh and youthful over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>.

#### Benefits
*   **Anti-aging**: By increasing cell turnover, it helps shed dead skin cells and promotes a more youthful appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.
*   **[[antiacne_products_and_remedies | Acne Treatment]]**: It reduces oil glands, decreases oiliness, and minimizes clogging, leading to clearer skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. It can also help reduce the appearance of scars over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.
*   **Isotretinoin (Accutane)**: This is an oral form of retinoid, a cousin of retinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>. It effectively dries out all glands, including tear glands, and can cause dry skin, lips, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. While highly effective for [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | severe acne]], it is teratogenic (harmful to a baby if a woman conceives while on it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:38">[01:42:38]</a> and can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) or derange lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a>. Therefore, it should be used judiciously under strict medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. Some studies suggest low-dose isotretinoin (e.g., 5mg daily) might have anti-aging benefits, but this is a nascent area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

#### Who Should Use It
Retinol works best for individuals with:
*   Thicker skin types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>
*   [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | Acne-prone skin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>
*   Oily skin types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>

#### Who Should Avoid It
Retinol is generally not recommended for:
*   Very thin skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>
*   Dry and sensitive skin, as it can cause irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>. For these skin types, other anti-aging options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

#### Precautions
*   **Sun Protection**: Retinol increases cell turnover and exfoliates the skin, making it more sensitive to the sun. Strict sun protection the next morning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>. If one is "lazy" with sunscreen, retinol should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>.
*   **Irritation**: It can be very irritating to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>, especially if the skin barrier is not protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>.

### Hyaluronic Acid
Hyaluronic acid has become a highly popular ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

#### How it Works
It acts like a concentrated, tightly bound water molecule, providing significant hydration to the skin, resulting in a "hydrated" or "plumpy" look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>.

#### Benefits
*   Provides intense hydration to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.
*   Contributes to a plump, dewy look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

#### Who Should Use It
Hyaluronic acid is ideal for:
*   Normal skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:02">[01:38:02]</a>
*   Calm skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>
*   Oily skin types that need moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>

#### Who Should Avoid It
*   **Dry and Sensitive Skin**: Despite being a hydrator, if applied to very dry or sensitive skin, it can irritate further rather than hydrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

## Importance of Professional Guidance
The rising popularity of various ingredients and multi-step [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | skincare routines]] (like Korean skincare) means many people are self-diagnosing and purchasing products without proper guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. However, not every ingredient works for everyone, and even seemingly harmless ones like Vitamin C can be detrimental if the skin is dry, chapped, sunburnt, or sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. It's crucial to consult a qualified, board-certified dermatologist for personalized advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. They can assess individual skin types and conditions to recommend suitable products and treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

> "Skincare is not like fashion. It's not that you buy something off the net, you wear it, 'oh it's not looking nice', okay let me chalk it. When you apply it... one use of something can harm if it's not the right thing for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>

A detailed consultation is essential to understand a patient's history, family skin conditions, travel history, and other factors that influence skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. This individualized approach ensures treatments and products are tailored to the specific needs of each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. Remember, healthy skin is always in fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a>.

Dandruff is a common scalp condition, and while often harmless, it can be an embarrassing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Understanding the type of dandruff and proper hair care practices can help manage or eliminate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Types of Dandruff
There are two main kinds of dandruff:
*   **Common Dandruff** White flakes that fall off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This type is generally not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Soric Dermatitis** This more severe type involves white flakes accompanied by intense itching in the scalp, around the hairline, and even the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It can also cause boils and rashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from soric dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist instead of relying on home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Understanding Dandruff Formation
Dandruff forms when the scalp, an active environment, constantly produces and sheds skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If the scalp is also very oily, these dead skin cells can collect and mix with the oil, forming the white flakes associated with dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Dandruff can be caused by imbalances, such as too little or too much oiling, shampooing, or conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Four Secrets to Cure Dandruff
For most common dandruff cases, these four secrets can help in its cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### 1. [[mens_hair_care_routine | Hair Care]] Mistakes to Avoid
Proper hair care practices are crucial for preventing dandruff.
*   **Oiling:** Oil acts as a "fertilizer" for your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Oil your hair at least two to three times a week to prevent the scalp from becoming too dry, which can increase dead skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. However, do not oil more than three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Shampooing:** Shampoo your hair two or three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. If you have dandruff, use [[using_antidandruff_and_mild_shampoos | anti-dandruff shampoo]] once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Avoid daily shampooing, as it strips the hair of its natural protective oil layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Conditioning:** Conditioners are oil-based substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Use a conditioner every time you use your [[using_antidandruff_and_mild_shampoos | mild shampoo]], but avoid overdoing it, as too much can make your scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Hair Product Usage:** Excessive use of hair products (waxes, gels, clays, serums, creams) can contribute to dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When applying these products, ensure they only come into contact with the body of your hair and not your scalp, as applying them to the scalp can worsen dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This applies to both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 2. [[importance_of_a_clean_environment_to_eliminate_dandruff | Care for Your Environment]]
Dandruff is considered an infection, so a clean environment is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Pillowcases:** Clean your pillowcases regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Dip them in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) for at least 12 hours to get rid of dandruff infestation <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes:** Similarly, clean your combs and brushes that you regularly use on your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear:** Any headgear, such as caps, hats, or helmets, should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hair Accessories:** If you use hair bands or hair clips, ensure they are also cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **General Rule:** Anything that comes into contact with your scalp should be washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### 3. [[home_remedies_for_dandruff_treatment | Home Remedies]]
The skin's pH is typically 5.5, meaning it's slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This acidity helps kill harmful bacteria and infections, acting as a protective layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. People with dandruff often have a scalp pH that is slightly off, not as acidic as it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many anti-dandruff products aim to correct this pH by making the scalp more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Natural products that are slightly acidic can help cure dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Curd** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Lemon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar** This is a highly recommended option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Use organic apple cider vinegar labeled "with the mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Mix it with a little water to make a dilute solution and apply it to your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It cleanses the scalp similarly to curd or lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### 4. [[benefits_of_organic_antidandruff_products | Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos]]
If you have dandruff, it's essential to use an [[using_antidandruff_and_mild_shampoos | anti-dandruff shampoo]] at least once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, many anti-dandruff shampoos contain sulfates, parabens, and other harmful chemicals that can damage hair quality in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Opt for organic hair products or shampoos that are sulfate and paraben-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. These products can help balance your scalp's pH and cure dandruff while maintaining the quality of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Emotional intelligence plays a crucial role in personal and professional life, and understanding gender differences in its expression and development can foster stronger relationships.

## Defining Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence involves the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as to perceive, understand, and influence the emotions of others. Key aspects include transparency, expressiveness, and empathy.

### Transparency and Expressiveness
Kiara Advani describes herself as a "very transparent" person who cannot hide her emotions; her face reflects if she's upset, happy, excited, or "pissed off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This openness is noted by the host, who feels she is a "very open person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. She considers herself to be the same person whether with loved ones, her team, or people she meets, indicating a consistent emotional presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This contrasts with some public figures who may present differently on and off camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>.

### Empathy and Understanding Others
Kiara's high "emotional quotient" means she often feels what others are feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. The host observes her strong people skills and ability to pick up on his podcasting techniques, demonstrating an intuitive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This capacity for empathy is linked to the idea that actors and psychologists are both observers of life and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

## Gender and Emotional Growth
There are observed differences in the emotional development and societal expectations placed on men and women.

### Men's Emotional Development
The host notes that men often "take very long to grow emotionally," frequently after the age of 30 or 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. He states that "girls are inherently emotionally aware, guys aren't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:15:00">[43:15:00]</a>, suggesting that men may need to actively develop this awareness.

Men's "trauma" often stems from societal expectations that their value is attached to money and fame, leading to feelings of worthlessness or being "mocked" if they don't achieve these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. This pressure can lead men to prioritize their professional life over their personal life until they feel settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>.

### Women's Emotional Development and Societal Roles
Historically, girls are raised with certain expectations and roles ingrained in their "DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>. However, contemporary conversations are blurring these traditional lines, challenging [[views_on_love_relationships_and_gender_roles | views on love relationships and gender roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. Women are seen as having inherent strengths in empathy and emotional awareness, which can significantly enhance decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.

### [[expectations_in_relationships | Expectations in Relationships]]
For women, core expectations include loyalty, trust, and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>. Respect involves accepting a person for who they are without trying to change their inherent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. While individuals grow and evolve, fundamental changes should not be forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

Kiara Advani emphasizes that relationships should involve mutual importance, where partners make each other feel valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. She dislikes the idea of putting someone on a "pedestal" or making them feel like a "queen," preferring a more "normal" connection based on mutual respect and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. Both partners need to feel "seen, heard, and understood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.

Men, in turn, often desire direct [[the_importance_of_communication_and_storytelling_in_intimacy | communication]] regarding their partner's needs and a relationship that offers a "place of vulnerable and a place of recovery" from external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:20:00">[43:20:00]</a>.

### Partnership and Mutual Support
A successful relationship is viewed as a partnership where both parties contribute time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>. A stable partner provides a space for "recovery" and healing, enabling individuals to pursue ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>. However, this mutual support relies on the partner's happiness and personal fulfillment, not just their role as a "re-energizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Emotional Intelligence
Developing emotional intelligence involves understanding others' intentions and fostering curiosity.

### Curiosity over Judgment
A monk advised replacing "judgment" with "curiosity" to foster growth in [[psychology_in_relationships | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>. Understanding the underlying intention behind someone's behavior, even anger, can reduce disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>. When judgment enters a relationship, it "locks the door" to true connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>.

### [[the_importance_of_communication_and_storytelling_in_intimacy | Communication]] and Ego
The biggest problems in relationships, whether romantic, platonic, or professional, are "communication and ego," which often lead to downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>. Being emotionally aware and understanding the pressures others face can help navigate these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>.

The host expresses his admiration for Kiara's ability to articulate her emotions, noting that she is "very articulate with your emotions and very aware of the needs and the feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:48:00">[45:48:00]</a>. This emotional articulation is seen as a valuable trait, especially for men, as it is less commonly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>.

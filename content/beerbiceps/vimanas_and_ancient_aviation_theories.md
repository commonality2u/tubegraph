Vimanas are described as "science fiction style stuff" within ancient Hindu culture and scriptures, particularly in the Puranas and the Mahabharata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. These accounts suggest advanced flying machines existed in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

## Descriptions of Vimanas
Texts like the Puranas contain descriptions of these flying machines. The Pushpak Vimana is the most well-known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.
*   The Pushpak Vimana was not originally with Ravana, but with his step-brother Kubera, the ruler of Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. Ravana usurped Kubera's throne and took his Pushpak Vimana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   Kubera escaped Lanka with the help of his minions, the Yakas, using two other "flying machines" or "spaceships" mentioned in the Uttara Kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
*   The Mahabharata also mentions flying machines, such as the one used by King Shalva to attack Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   The Vimanas were supposedly powered by a "Mercury Vortex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. Mercury, a semi-fluid metal, was described as the power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

## Theories on Vimana Origins
The presence of such advanced technology leads to [[theories_on_lost_ancient_civilizations_and_their_possible_technologies | theories on lost ancient civilizations and their possible technologies]]. It is suggested that ancient civilizations did not necessarily create Vimanas themselves but were given the knowledge to create them by an [[influence_of_alien_theories_in_ancient_cultures | advanced civilization]], possibly [[influence_of_alien_theories_in_ancient_cultures | aliens]] or the 'Devas' (gods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

*   The Pushpak Vimana was created by Vishwakarma, the architect of the gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   King Shalva's flying machine in the Mahabharata was created by Mayadanav, the architect of the Asuras (demons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   This suggests that these were advanced civilizations who provided these machines for human use, similar to an advanced country providing arms to a third-world country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

## Scientific Interpretations and Potential
The *Vaimanika Shastra* is mentioned as a text that details different types and shapes of planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   People in Western countries have reportedly attempted to build small models of these shapes and test their aerodynamic stability, finding them to be aerodynamically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   The primary challenge remains deciphering the "Mercury Vortex" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
*   The concept of Vimanas also prompts questions about how planes could fly without fossil fuels, similar to how birds fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. This suggests different engineering methods could have been employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

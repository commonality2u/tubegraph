Haircuts are considered the most crucial aspect of male grooming, significantly impacting one's appearance and how neat and tidy they look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. They affect facial structure and, more importantly, influence whether one appears scruffy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Hair Type Considerations

For many [[indian_mens_grooming_tips | Indian guys]] who often have rough hair, growing it out is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Long hair is only suitable if it is naturally silky smooth, like John Abraham's hair used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Recommended Haircut Style

To achieve a neat and classy look, the "golden haircut" is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This style features a slightly long top with slightly short sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Notable athletes like Virat Kohli, Cristiano Ronaldo, Olivier Giroud, and Robin Van Persie all follow this protocol with varying ratios of top to side length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Some prefer longer tops with short sides, while others opt for slightly longer sides and not-so-long tops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Ultimately, the most important rule is to select a haircut that suits one's specific face and face structure perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The primary goal is to always look neat and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, as women tend to associate [[importance_of_cleanliness_and_personal_hygiene | cleanliness]] with looking good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

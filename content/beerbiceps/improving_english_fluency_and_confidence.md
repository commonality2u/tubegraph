## Improving English Fluency and Confidence

Improving spoken English and communication skills is a highly requested topic [00:00:07]. While acknowledging his own weaknesses in languages, Ranveer shares five simple steps to enhance spoken English, noting that the same tricks he used for Hindi can be applied to English [00:00:31]. The key is to make the learning process easy and enjoyable [00:01:03].

### 1. Make the Process Enjoyable and Consistent

The first step in improving a spoken language is to enjoy the process [01:03:00]. This approach offers three easy solutions that should be practiced for a minimum of 15 minutes daily, and ideally up to an hour [01:11:00].

> [!NOTE] Consistency is key
> You need to make it a habit to practice these options for at least 15 minutes every day [01:16:00]. An hour a day is a good starting point [01:25:00].

Choose what you enjoy the most from the following options for [[practicing_english_through_media_and_content | practicing English through media and content]]:

*   **Easy Video Content:** Watching cartoons or simple video content is highly recommended as the language used is straightforward and designed for easy comprehension [01:30:00]. If you feel too old for cartoons, sports commentary by figures like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, or Harsh Bhogle is another excellent option due to its clear communication [01:58:00]. The goal is to pick video content that you genuinely enjoy [02:09:00].
*   **Audio Content:** If video content isn't your preference, listening to radio or podcasts can be equally effective [02:21:00].
*   **Simple English Reading:** Reading simple English texts, such as a 10th standard ICSE textbook with short stories, can be beneficial for those who learn better through reading [02:26:00].

The ultimate goal for this first step is to find what works best for you and consistently engage with it [02:42:00].

### 2. Observe English Sentence Construction

Once consistent practice is established, the next step is to observe English from the outside [02:58:00]. The focus here is not on expanding vocabulary or learning big words, but on [[understanding_english_sentence_construction | understanding English sentence construction]] [03:00:00].

As you consume video, audio, or written content, pay attention to how sentences are structured, especially when they differ from your own thinking [03:08:00]. Make a mental note of these differences and recognize them as areas for improvement [03:22:00]. Practice saying these correct constructions to yourself multiple times [03:31:00]. Only after grasping sentence construction should you focus on vocabulary or new words [03:36:00]. This ability to understand spoken English comes from consistent practice and absorption [03:43:00].

### 3. Put Your Ego Aside

A significant barrier to improving English, particularly in Indian society, is the misconception that English proficiency equates to intelligence [04:00:00]. This leads to people judging others' English easily [04:06:00]. However, when someone mocks your English, they are often projecting their own insecurities [04:10:00].

[[overcoming_languagerelated_insecurities_and_ego | Overcoming language-related insecurities and ego]] is crucial [04:24:00]. You must let go of your ego, arrogance, and the fear of making mistakes [04:26:00]. Making mistakes while speaking English is perfectly fine [04:31:00]. In fact, when people point out your mistakes, you are likely to remember them, leading to improvement [04:35:00]. Focus on becoming the best version of yourself rather than worrying about others' opinions [04:42:00].

### 4. Chase Clarity of Thought

Many people struggle with speaking English because they worry about what others will think ("log kahenge") and get caught in the mental translation process from their native language [05:01:00]. The solution is to focus on clarity of thought [05:11:00].

*   **Meditation:** While it may sound unusual, meditation is highly recommended for clearing the mind and grounding the thought process [05:15:00]. It is an effective way to improve mental clarity, which in turn aids in speaking clearly [05:22:00]. Meditation is presented as a fundamental skill that can benefit "absolutely every single life skill" [05:33:00].

### 5. Stop Giving English Too Much Importance

The final point is to reduce the excessive importance placed on English [05:40:00]. The association of English with intelligence is a significant societal flaw in India, stemming from 200 years of British rule [05:43:00]. This mentality is unique to India; in other countries like Germany or Japan, people primarily speak their native languages with pride [05:57:00].

[[balancing_the_importance_of_english_with_cultural_pride | Balancing the importance of English with cultural pride]] is essential [06:31:00]. Being proud of your own culture and language is paramount [06:31:00]. If you struggle with English, it's not a major issue [06:36:00]. If you get stuck, it's acceptable to complete your sentences in Hindi or your native language [06:41:00]. The younger generation is more accepting of mixing languages [06:17:00], unlike the older generation who might emphasize perfect English [06:22:00]. You should be proud of the languages your forefathers spoke [06:50:00].

The Chanchlani family, including parents and children Ashish and Muskan, discusses the dynamics of family expectations, the inculcation of values, and the journey of pursuing unconventional careers while staying grounded.

## Core Family Values and Upbringing
The interviewer highlights the "correct values" instilled in Ashish and Muskan, noting that they are at the top of their industry while still demonstrating these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Both Ashish and Muskan are described as very humble and good-hearted, with humility being their greatest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They treat everyone, including their cook and watchman, with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This extends to their peers, as they do not feel jealous of others' success, instead feeling positive about the hard work of others, like Amit Bhadana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The family believes that true success lies in [[importance_of_family_values_in_upbringing | sticking to humility]] and remaining down to earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Parental Perspectives on Pursuing Unconventional Careers
The parents have played a significant role in supporting their children's career paths, even when they were unconventional.

### Supporting Ashish's Acting Ambitions
Ashish's father, who comes from a business background, highlights Ashish's early involvement in their multiplex business from the age of 16-17, where he regularly handled banking and brought in new technology like 3D and Dolby sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Despite this business involvement, Ashish's passion was always acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

When Ashish decided he didn't want to continue engineering, his father told him to pursue acting but emphasized the importance of finishing his studies, advising him not to leave midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He views education as important alongside passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Ashish's mother initially didn't understand his vine videos, questioning what he was doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, after seeing them, she became happy and supported him, providing whatever he needed for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. She even offered feedback, once suggesting he reduce his video frequency to avoid audience boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. His mother also shared that Ashish's obsessive dedication to his craft, even talking dialogues in his sleep, is crucial for someone starting a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Managing Fame and Staying Grounded
Ashish's father consciously instilled in him that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and that the "hunger for success makes you humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. He taught his children about the transient nature of fame by recounting experiences with film stars like Aamir Khan and Sunny Deol, demonstrating how public perception changes with a film's success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This exposure taught Ashish from childhood that success, not just money, brings genuine respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## [[career_choices_and_parental_support | Parental Guidance and Independence]]
Ashish's father attributes his son's business strength to his early exposure to work, unlike many "rich kids" who are sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Ashish learned to trace, demonstrating his hands-on approach and shaping his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Ashish explains that he learned from his father, who despite being the son of a "big man" (his grandfather), felt the pressure to become a legend in his own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Ashish wanted to avoid flaunting family wealth and instead desired to be independent, earn on his own, and create his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

Muskan learned humility and bonding with everyone from her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. She also notes her mother's consistent positivity and optimism, always finding something good in every situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. From her father, Muskan learned "never to give up" and "always to love everyone," treating people with respect regardless of their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Advice for Parents of Aspiring Youth
Ashish's mother offers advice to parents nervous about their children pursuing unconventional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. She advises parents to:
*   Allow their children to pursue their desires initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Give them at least a year to see if they can succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   If they find success, even later in life, don't stop or restrict them; "let him fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Avoid tying children down with too many rules, as this can lead to confusion about their life path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

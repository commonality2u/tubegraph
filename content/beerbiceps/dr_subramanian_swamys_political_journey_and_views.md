Dr. Subramanian Swamy is described as one of the most educated and controversial figures in the history of Independent India, known for not shying away from speaking the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He brings a new angle to conversations, often being as controversial, fiery, and intense as his past discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. He made his first-ever podcast appearance on TRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## Background and Career
Dr. Swamy began his career as an economics professor, co-authoring papers with Nobel laureates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He has been a Member of Parliament six times and a minister twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He recalls having a peak mental age of 35 when he was a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a> and claims to still be 35 mentally, capable of grasping new ideas, reading, and lecturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. He left Harvard to come to India and declined an offer to head the BRICS Bank, stating his intention to remain in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

He noted that people initially told him he would at most be an advisor, and would never become a minister because he speaks his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. He believes that becoming Prime Minister should be something "imposed" on an individual due to circumstances and merit, not something one actively strives for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. He cites Lal Bahadur Shastri and P. V. Narasimha Rao as examples of individuals who unexpectedly became Prime Ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

## Political Journey and Party Affiliation
Dr. Swamy has been associated with the Jan Sangh, which merged into the Janata Party, and then the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. He states that his party affiliation never really changed, as the Jan Sangh evolved into the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. He is not from the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) background, but his ideology largely coincided with theirs, and he became important to the RSS and BJP due to his ability to articulate their ideology effectively in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

He claims it would be very difficult for PM Modi to throw him out of the BJP because of his roots in the Hindu sentiment, his reputation as a Hindu scholar and activist, and his contributions to the Hindu cause, such as saving the Ram Setu and liberating temples from government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

## Core Political Views

### Views on PM Modi
Dr. Swamy expresses significant difficulties with PM Modi, stating that he "tells lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> and claims credit for work he did not do, such as securing the Supreme Court's clearance for the Ram Mandir project, which Dr. Swamy asserts he achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. He also accuses PM Modi of dishonesty, citing instances like denying Chinese occupation of Indian territory in Ladakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. He has had no interaction with PM Modi since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

He criticizes PM Modi for selecting cabinet members who lack a "spine" and only act according to Modi's wishes, with the exception of one or two individuals like Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari who can speak up frankly but are not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>. He states there is no healthy team spirit in the BJP, describing it as "Modi and then Sancho Panza" (referring to Amit Shah as Man Friday) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Dr. Swamy has not interacted with Amit Shah, citing his knowledge of Shah's past actions in Gujarat as a reason he doesn't want to meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>.

Regarding PM Modi's regime, he believes it is leading India into a "massive depression" by 2030, likening it to the 1930s in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:00">[45:07:07]</a>. He also suggests that if PM Modi wins the next election, he might aim to postpone future [[elections_and_political_strategy_in_india | elections]] indefinitely, comparing his mentality to that of Hitler and Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. He has openly stated that PM Modi should either not contest or be defeated in the upcoming [[elections_and_political_strategy_in_india | elections]], as he considers him "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" due to a perceived lack of values and a belief in dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.

### Views on Congress and Gandhi Family
Dr. Swamy attributes the consolidation of Hindus and the rise of the BJP to a "deliberate attempt" by Jawaharlal Nehru's time to make Muslims feel safe only with the Congress party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. He claims the Congress pampered Muslims by providing "goodies" and police support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>. He states that if the BJP is in power, there will be no Hindu-Muslim riots, but if Congress is in power, they will incite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.

He describes Rahul Gandhi as an "idiot" and Sonia Gandhi as "hopeless," accusing her of working for anti-Indian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. He is currently prosecuting them for [[corruption_in_indian_politics | corruption]] in the National Herald case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He also alleges that Sonia Gandhi knew if she and her children left politics for Europe, they couldn't escape the consequences of the crimes they committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. He claims to have stopped Sonia Gandhi from becoming Prime Minister in 2004 by finding a technicality with then-President Abdul Kalam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

He holds a high regard for Rajiv Gandhi, describing him as a "wonderful man" and a "man of his word" who was nationalistic, built the Indian army, and had the guts to put Ramayana on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. He feels it was a tragedy that Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated and believes no other member of the Gandhi family possesses his "humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

He views Manmohan Singh as a "wonderful man" but lacking a "spine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>, implying Sonia Gandhi was effectively running the country during his premiership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

### [[Corruption in Indian politics | Corruption]] and Economic Policy
Dr. Swamy believes that while there has always been an element of [[corruption_in_indian_politics | corruption]] in [[indias_political_landscape | Indian society]] since Independence, the current situation involves "plunder" where resources are siphoned off and not used for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. He describes the electoral bonds as a "mighty scandal" where bankrupt companies with "dirty money" received government contracts after making large payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>. He states that there is no transparency and many lies are being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.

As an economist, he disputes the claimed 8-9% GDP growth rate, stating it is not more than 4% because the government evaluates GDP at current prices, which includes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>. To counter an impending "massive depression," he proposes abolishing income tax to boost demand, noting that high income tax is largely collected for the personal pockets of tax officials and ministers, not for national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:43:00">[46:43:00]</a>. He states that he would increase bank interest rates to 9% to encourage savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>.

### Foreign Policy
Dr. Swamy asserts that PM Modi's foreign policy is entirely his will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. He criticizes India's non-aligned stance, questioning why India buys "junk from Russia" and trades in the Rupee-Ruble without proper exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>. He claims China's intention is to "swallow a good part of your territory" and show the world that India is not a significant global factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>. He believes India is "potentially the first factor" but currently less than third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:09:00">[54:09:00]</a>.

He calls for economic policy changes and a military defeat of China, stating that China would "run from here" if India decided to confront them, as they have done twice before (in 1967 in Nathu La Pass and in 1988 in Sumdorong Chu Valley) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>. He attributes the lack of action against China to PM Modi being "blackmailed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:23:00">[56:23:00]</a>. He also views Putin as a "servant of the Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a>.

He considers the United States an ally, especially within the Quad framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:48:00">[58:48:00]</a>.

## Personal Traits and Experiences

### Fearlessness and Past Incidents
Dr. Swamy is renowned for his fearlessness, stating his mother believed he had a "wire missing in his brain" because he was never afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a>. He recounts venturing into a Hindu-Muslim riot at Turkman Gate in Delhi as a seven-year-old in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>.

During the Emergency (1975-1977), Mrs. Gandhi filed 18 cases against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:07]</a>. He went underground, traveling the country in disguise, including wearing a false beard and a Sardar's turban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. On Jayaprakash Narayan's advice, he escaped abroad to campaign against the Emergency in America and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. Despite an Interpol notice, he returned to India, landed in New Delhi, lived in his house with 25 policemen outside, and made a one-minute speech in Parliament before disappearing again, a feat he believes "smashed Mrs. Gandhi's" perception that "all trains are going on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

### Personal Life and Philosophy
Dr. Swamy's wife is Parsi, and his son-in-law is Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. He states that his wife is a "very tough lady" who raised their two young children (Suas and Gali) while he was abroad for 20 months during the Emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. He supported his daughter's choice of husband, noting that the marriage ceremony was Hindu (Arya Samaji laws), and the groom's father was an atheist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. He emphasizes that being "pro-Hindutva" does not mean being anti-Muslim, as all Indian Muslims share the same DNA as Hindus, meaning their ancestors were Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. His core philosophy is to unite Hindus by helping them understand their true history and religion, correcting falsehoods perpetrated during the British and Mughal periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>. He highlights the high status of women in Hinduism, citing goddesses like Saraswati (education), Durga (defense), Lakshmi (finance), and Kali (fiercest fighter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.

He attributes his peace of mind to his belief in Lord Krishna's teaching from the Bhagavad Gita: focus on action, not results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. He states that he is doing what he likes, and his underlying purpose in life is to see India become a very strong country, recover lost territory, and grow at 10% per year for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.

## Media and Transparency
Dr. Swamy acknowledges that his direct communication style makes him a "headline machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. He criticizes the media for being "shut up" by the Prime Minister's office, claiming a *firman* (order) was issued to Delhi's English newspapers not to publish anything about him, which has resulted in almost no coverage for four years, with rare exceptions from *The Hindu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:18">[03:19:18]</a>. He noted that he is the only one in the BJP who speaks openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.

He suggests that politicians, including PM Modi and Amit Shah, should engage in open, civil conversations rather than combative news channel debates to connect with the youth and audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. However, he believes they won't, as they were not brought up that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## [[Future of Indias democracy | Future of India]]
Dr. Swamy is 100% certain that [[future_of_indias_democracy | India is going to be a great country]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. He believes that if India grows at 10% per year for another five years, it could potentially become the first factor globally, surpassing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:33:00">[54:33:00]</a>. He emphasizes the need for leadership that empowers people to feel they are contributing themselves, rather than relying on a leader who claims "I do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. He wants to see [[future_of_indias_democracy | India]] recover all its "lost property" (land) and grow at 10% per year for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. He expects more entrepreneurs to enter politics as [[indias_political_landscape | India]] becomes more developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

He shared his experience of opening the Kailash Mansarovar route through talks with the Chinese, becoming the first Indian to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He describes the experience of seeing Mount Kailash and having a dip in Mansarovar Lake as "undescribable" and creating a "huge impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.

Praveen Mohan, a requested guest since 2019, explores ancient sites globally to uncover forgotten truths about the past, especially concerning [[ancient_indian_temples_and_architecture | ancient Indian temples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. He documents 10% of his findings on YouTube, fascinating an entire nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Challenging the Evolutionary View of Ancient Construction

Modern construction demonstrates a clear evolution of technique, where each new building improves upon previous designs to become taller or better, such as the progression from the Eiffel Tower to the CN Tower and then to the Burj Khalifa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This evolutionary pattern suggests continuous improvement in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

However, this concept of "evolution of technique" often does not apply to ancient Indian structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. For example:
*   The Ajanta Caves are both the largest and oldest cave temple structure in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   Kallanai Dam, a 2,000-year-old structure, is both the largest and oldest ancient dam in India, capable of changing a river's flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   The Kailasa Temple, built 1,300 years ago, is carved out of a single mountain starting from the top, making it a unique one-stone structure with no metal or wooden blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

The absence of progressively larger or more complex structures built in the 1,300 to 2,000 years *after* these monumental achievements suggests a different pattern of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. British scholars who studied these structures were reportedly shocked by their out-of-pattern construction, as if "a giant woke up and they built insane structures and they're gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This lack of an evolutionary slope or precursor challenges the traditional historical narrative that these were built with primitive tools like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Evidence of Advanced Ancient Construction Technologies

### Lathe Machines
Archaeologists confirm that many pillars in temples in Karnataka, such as those in Hoysala and Chennakesava Temples, were made using [[indian_ancient_sciences_and_lost_knowledge | lathe technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. A lathe machine is a rotating mechanism used to create perfect cylindrical or circular shapes, as seen in the turn marks on the pillars, similar to lines on a constantly rotating potter's wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. The pillars, weighing up to 20 tons, would have required lathes potentially 300 to 400 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Experts are reportedly embarrassed to admit they don't know how these ancient civilizations possessed such large-scale lathe machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Hollow Stone Carvings
In certain dark temples, a doorkeeper sculpture (Dwarapalika) has a crown studded with intricate stone skulls, each about one inch in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. These skulls are completely hollow, with threads or twigs able to pass through eye sockets, ears, and mouths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:17]</a>. The ability to create such intricate, hollow stone carvings with precise internal channels implies the use of advanced tools beyond chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Lightweight, Earthquake-Proof Bricks
The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is constructed with bricks that are unusually light and float in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This technology is similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), where foam or other lightweight materials are injected into the concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This ancient technique served as an early form of earthquake-proofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The temple, built 800-900 years ago, withstood a massive earthquake that destroyed all other structures in the area, demonstrating the advanced foresight and engineering knowledge of its builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Misinformation and the True Nature of History

The speaker suggests that the lack of acknowledgment of these advanced technologies in history books is part of a "calculated bias" and "misinformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. He posits that historical narratives were written 100-200 years ago and confined to discoveries of the 80s or early 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. With modern globalization and the spread of information through platforms like YouTube, people are increasingly realizing that official history books may be full of inaccuracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

A parallel is drawn with the history of Aboriginal people in Australia, whose culture and history were suppressed by colonizers classifying them as "flora and fauna" and separating children from their families to erase cultural knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Similarly, it's argued that Indians were "distanced from the Real History of our country" through changes in the education system and the teaching of a "wrong history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Temples as Stone Encyclopedias

[[ancient_indian_temples_and_architecture | Ancient Indian temples]] were not merely places of worship but served as "town museums" or "Wikipedias in stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. They were designed to impart knowledge across different age groups, with carvings arranged in levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>:
*   **0-5 years**: Bottom levels display animals, appealing to children's natural curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. These carvings sometimes depict humorous or surprising scenes, acting as an "Animal Planet or Discovery Channel back in the day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **6-10 years**: The next level showcases music and dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **11-15 years**: This section features [[indian_ancient_sciences_and_lost_knowledge | science and technology]], such as a sundial in Konark Temple that can tell time down to the minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **16-20 years**: Depicts war, administration, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **21-25 years**: Contains erotica and depictions of lovemaking, normalizing aspects of human life. It also shows advanced medical practices, such as women giving birth while standing, which is a recommended modern practice due to gravity's aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Some carvings even illustrate post-birth disinfection methods using specific plants and herbs, a practice observed in certain tribes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Above 25 years**: Only at the highest level are the deities or gods depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

The use of stone for these carvings was intentional, as it is the most durable medium, ensuring that these "messages for future generations" would withstand time and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker encourages critical thinking when reading history, emphasizing that there are "serious holes in history and archaeology books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He suggests that humanity is not the most advanced civilization and that more advanced civilizations may have existed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, possibly influencing ancient builders with their [[technologys_impact_on_geopolitics | advanced technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the need to uncover "hidden truths" that could benefit modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

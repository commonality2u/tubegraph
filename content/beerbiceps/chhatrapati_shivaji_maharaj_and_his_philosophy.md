This article is the first part of a three-episode special focusing on [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]. This initial installment delves into the socio-economic and political conditions of India before the formation of his empire, as explained by researcher Medha Bhaskar, who has dedicated over 20 years to studying these subjects [01:01:01].

## The Naming of Shivrai

Medha Bhaskar refers to [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] as "Shivrai" [04:18:21]. This term is used as a respectful abbreviation, where "Rai" signifies "Raja" (king), encapsulating the full title in a single word, making it easier to mention repeatedly in interviews [04:53:00]. This episode aims to rebuild the historical context of his era for a broader audience, as knowledge about him tends to be more concentrated in Maharashtra [05:21:00].

## India's State Before Shivaji Maharaj

Before [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s birth in the 17th century (around 1630) [01:19:19], India had endured centuries of invasions and suffering [01:05:56]. The author notes that to truly understand [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s mentality, history, and conquests, it is crucial to understand the state of India before his emergence [03:48:00].

### A History of Invasions and Suffering
For approximately 800 years, invaders systematically plundered India's wealth [01:17:00]. These invaders often had superior military tactics, such as effective use of horses, compared to Indian armies that relied heavily on elephants [01:24:00].

The mentality of the Indian people during this period was marked by fear, suffering, and a significant loss of self-esteem, leading to a "servile mentality" [01:29:00]. The invasions brought immense brutality, including mass killings, and the abduction of women and children as property or sex slaves [01:06:00].

The term "Sultani Calamity" referred to the devastation caused by incoming raiders, while "Asmani Calamity" denoted natural disasters, both being common phrases of the time, reflecting a widespread sense of vulnerability and insecurity [02:30:00].

The northern parts of India suffered significantly until the 13th century, after which the Deccan region also began to experience similar hardships [02:12:00]. The Portuguese in Goa, for example, forcibly converted people and imposed their lifestyle, using torture chambers for those who resisted [01:21:00].

### The Mughal Empire
At the time of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s birth, the Mughal Empire dominated the North, encompassing 22 provinces [02:13:00]. The empire's administration heavily relied on a system of "mansabdars" and "jagirdars" [01:00:00].

*   **Mansabdars/Jagirdars**: These were warriors granted land by the king or sultan [00:52:00]. Their responsibilities included overseeing cultivators, collecting taxes (as agriculture was the primary industry), and maintaining a cavalry force for the king [00:07:07]. Essentially, the army was outsourced, with 80% of the Mughal Empire's land granted to these mansabdars [01:17:00]. These mansabdars often lived like "mini-kings," and justice for the common Indian was scarce under their ruthless military rule [01:07:00].
*   **Mughal Army**: The Mughal army was formidable, with 200,000 well-mounted, heavily armored cavalrymen [02:59:00]. Their campaigns were vast, with vanguard forces in one village and tail-guard in another, creating an "optical illusion" of immense strength designed to intimidate and cause people to surrender [02:07:00]. The army included soldiers from diverse regions, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Russians, with racial discrimination prevalent against dark-skinned Indian Hindus who were paid less [01:19:00]. They also employed advanced artillery, including lightweight cannons trained by Portuguese experts, capable of firing both explosives and cannonballs [01:33:00].

Emperors possessed unique symbols like sun, moon, fish, and swastika, which lesser sultans were not permitted to display [02:08:00]. These sultans, like the Adil Shahi and Qutb Shahi in the Deccan, were vassals who paid tribute to the Mughal emperor [02:51:00].

### The Harsh Realities of Mughal Rulers

The romanticized depictions of Mughal emperors in historical films and dramas are often inaccurate [02:51:00]. According to Medha Bhaskar, these films often highlight only the positive aspects, creating "historical fiction" that is perceived as real history by the audience [03:00:00].

*   **Akbar**: Contrary to popular belief, Akbar was "very cruel" and killed some of his subordinates to acquire their women [03:00:00]. His aim was to dissolve the southern kingdoms into the empire, not just keep them as vassals [02:51:00].
*   **Salim (Jahangir) and Khusrau**: Salim, later Emperor Jahangir, was notoriously cruel [03:01:00]. His son, Khusrau, who was handsome, intellectual, and favored by Akbar, was brutally tortured by Salim for going against him [00:16:00]. Salim blinded Khusrau by removing his eyes and pouring salt water into the sockets for "excruciating pain" [03:45:00]. Khusrau was later killed by his half-brother, Shah Jahan [03:01:00].
*   **Succession and Brutality**: Mughal history is replete with instances of ruthless succession struggles, where "it was either the throne or the grave" [03:07:00]. Shah Jahan himself killed 36 relatives to secure his claim to the throne [03:16:00].

### Aurangzeb's Ascendancy

Understanding Emperor [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] is essential to understanding [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]], as they were direct adversaries [04:00:00]. [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s rise to power exemplifies the brutal Mughal succession policy [04:22:00].

*   **Strategic Positioning**: Shah Jahan deliberately assigned [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] to less fertile and challenging provinces like Kabul and the Deccan, while his favored son, Dara Shikho, received rich, fertile lands like Punjab [04:40:00]. This limited [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s military power and funds [04:50:00].
*   **Ruthless Tactics**: [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] was exceptionally skilled in military tactics and a formidable warrior [04:49:00]. He strategically decided to conquer the wealthy Deccan sultanates (Qutub Shahi and Adil Shahi) to seize their treasuries and bolster his army, even defying his father's orders [04:59:00].
*   **War of Succession**: [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] cunningly allied with his younger, drunken brother Murad, promising him the throne [05:22:00]. He leveraged religion, portraying Dara Shikho as an "idolater" and "non-believer" for his secular discussions with Hindu, Christian, and Muslim scholars, thereby gaining the support of orthodox mansabdars [05:22:00].
*   **Defeat of Rivals**:
    *   **Dara Shikho**: Dara, a secular intellectual, was defeated by [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] and Murad's forces, including a massive Rajput army led by Jaswant Singh Rathore [05:40:00]. Dara was eventually captured by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, brought to Delhi, tried under Sharia law, and beheaded [01:00:00]. His "crime" was writing a book titled "Mingling of Two Oceans," which explored the meeting of two religions [01:00:00].
    *   **Shah Shuja**: Sent to Bengal, Shah Shuja was a womanizer [04:44:00]. He was driven deep into Bengal by [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s forces and, according to one strong hypothesis by Sir Yadunath Sarkar, was caught and eaten by cannibals in Arakan (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma border) along with his entire family [01:08:00].
    *   **Murad**: After their victories, [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]] eliminated Murad, who died of an opium overdose and was later hung [01:15:00].
    *   **Muhammad Sultan**: Even [[Conflict and politics during the time of Aurangzeb and Shivaji | Aurangzeb]]'s eldest son, Muhammad Sultan, who joined Shah Shuja, was imprisoned and died of depression at the age of 36 in Gwalior Fort [01:15:00].

This brutal period of Mughal rule was marked by immense wealth extraction from cultivators, leading to an empire at its peak economically, but at the cost of widespread suffering among the common people [01:04:00]. The empire's vast revenue (worth 3.5 billion USD in today's money) was built on "sucking the blood and sweat" of the agricultural industry [01:04:00].

## The Purpose of History

History, as explained by the speaker, serves to teach modern humans lessons to prevent the repetition of past mistakes [01:09:00]. Studying the psychology of defeated people is crucial for understanding how societies survive and identifying patterns that could lead to suffering [01:24:00]. The speaker emphasizes that religion, throughout human history, has often been used as a tool to control masses and gain power [01:59:00].

[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his philosophy | Shivaji Maharaj]]'s vision, which is the "muse" for the author's books, stands in stark contrast to the power-hungry rulers of his time [01:42:00]. His unique vision and its relevance today will be explored in subsequent parts of this series [01:49:00].

[[levels_and_practices_within_tantra | Dakara Tantra]] is considered a formal stage within [[understanding_tantra_practices | Tantra]], marking a significant progression in [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Initiation Requirements
To begin [[levels_and_practices_within_tantra | Dakara Tantra]] practice, initiation (`disha`) from a `guru` is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This `guru` must have the authority to grant the initiation and be part of a `guru parampara` (lineage of gurus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. While verbal advice (`upadesha`) may suffice for [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | Shiva]] or [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | Krishna mantras]], `abhisheka diksha` (a specific form of initiation) is mandatory for [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | Shakti mantras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>. This is because [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | Shakti mantras]], particularly `bija mantras`, work with tremendous speed, causing rapid changes in the individual that require experienced guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>.

## Practices in Dakara Tantra
[[levels_and_practices_within_Tantra | Dakara Tantra]] primarily involves `Mantra sadhana` (disciplined practice of mantras) dedicated to one's chosen `devata` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Key practices include:
*   **Mantra Sadhana** Repeated chanting of specific divine mantras to connect with the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>.
*   **Nasas** The practice of placing [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | mantras]] on different parts of the body by chanting and touching those areas. Over time, through resonance, the body is purified, and the deity approaches faster. This is likened to a "spiritual tattoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Preparatory Rituals** Even before beginning `Mantra upasana`, certain `shauchis` (purifications) and preparation of the meditation space must be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Offerings** Standard religious ingredients are used for offerings (`bhog`) to the `devata`, typically vegetarian items such as rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. Worship is performed at specific times of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>.

### Secrecy
From the [[levels_and_practices_within_tantra | Dakara Tantra]] stage onward, secrecy becomes important. These practices should not be performed in front of those who are not meant to see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Right-Hand Path
[[levels_and_practices_within_tantra | Dakara Tantra]] follows the "right-hand path" (`dakshinachara`), which is considered parallel to the Vedic path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>. This means it adheres to similar restrictions and practices as the Vedic system, avoiding actions that would be considered improper in that tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. It is a powerful method of practice, and those who master it can achieve significant spiritual accomplishments (`siddhi`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>.

### Contrast with Vamachara
[[levels_and_practices_within_tantra | Dakara Tantra]] is distinct from `Vamachara` (the "left-hand path"), which comes after `Dakara Tantra` and involves more controversial practices, including the use of `Pancham makaka` (five forbidden substances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>. `Vamachara` is meant only for individuals who have fully integrated `Dakara Tantra` and are deemed fit by their `guru` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>.

[[Suniel Shettys personal and professional life journey | Suniel Shetty]] emphasizes that health and wellness have been consistent factors throughout his life, regardless of career success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The pandemic further underscored the importance of focusing on one's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He connects with the youth by discussing health and wellness, inspiring them to prioritize their well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Philosophy and Mindset
Suniel Shetty views age as "just a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He believes in setting goals and manifesting them, citing examples like aiming to be the "fittest 50" and achieving a "six-pack at 60" through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. His fitness routine is intertwined with his lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. His knowledge of health, nutrition, and science stems from his background in martial arts, specifically the Okinawa Goju-ryu school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Daily Routine and Habits
Shetty's approach to fitness is broken down into a simple mantra: "80% diet and probably 10% training and 10% habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
Key habits include:
*   **Sleep**: Early to bed and early to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He aims to be up by 5 or 6 AM, ensuring bedtime by 10 or 10:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. He maintains this routine and catches up on sleep during the week if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Training**: He trains early in the morning for 45 minutes to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **"Me Time"**: When at the gym or gardening, he leaves his phone behind to fully immerse himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Diet and Nutrition
His dietary principles are strict and focus on simplicity and whole foods:
*   **Home-cooked Meals**: He quantifies his food and eats simple, home-cooked meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He avoids ordering from outside due to concerns about preservatives and unknown ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "White" Foods**: He stays away from milk, white rice, salt, and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Calorie Awareness**: He counts his calories and oil intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Supplements**: While he tried protein supplements for muscle depletion, he found it didn't suit him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He now works with a nutritionist to address any deficiencies with natural supplements, emphasizing the importance of individual blood routines to determine what a body needs at different life stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He believes "food is life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

## Impact of Aging on Fitness
As an action hero, he acknowledges slowing down with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, he views aging as an opportunity to become smarter and wiser, allowing him to manage his energy and present himself better on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He describes every stage of life as "beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Role of Sports in Health
Shetty believes that participation in sports from a young age contributes to long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. He encourages parents to get their children involved in sports to learn teamwork, experience loss, and develop hand-eye coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. He stresses that these experiences build confidence and sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

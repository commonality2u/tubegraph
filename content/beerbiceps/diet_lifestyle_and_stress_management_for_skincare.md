A comprehensive approach to skincare extends beyond topical treatments to include [[Impact of diet and lifestyle on skin health|dietary choices]], [[lifestyle_changes_to_improve_gut_health_including_exercise_and_diet|lifestyle habits]], and [[Role of stress and mental wellbeing in skin conditions|stress management]]. These internal factors play a crucial role in maintaining healthy skin and preventing common skin issues like acne and blemishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Diet Factors for Skin Health

Diet is a fundamental component of healthy skin, impacting its clarity and overall quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
To improve skin health through diet, it is recommended to:
*   **Reduce Sugar Intake:** Quit sugar to prevent negative effects on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:30">[09:45:30]</a>.
*   **Limit Processed and Fried Foods:** Decrease consumption of junk food, restaurant meals ("hotel kakana"), and absolutely avoid packaged fried snacks, which are often high in refined flour (maida), unhealthy oils, and trans fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. These ingredients can lead to skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Increase Whole Foods:** Incorporate a greater variety of vegetables and fruits into your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Dietary Balance:** Avoid overconsuming any single type of food, whether it's non-vegetarian options, eggs, or specific vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Lifestyle Factors for Skin Health

Beyond diet, daily lifestyle choices contribute significantly to skin appearance and health.
*   **Regular Face Washing:** It is essential to wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up or reaching your workplace/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Sweat Cleansing:** If you engage in cardio or activities that cause a lot of sweating, such as playing football or cricket, wash your face a third time after returning home from your session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, aim for twice a day and only go for three times on those occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Stress Management for Skin Health

[[Role of stress and mental wellbeing in skin conditions|Stress]] is as crucial to skin health as diet and can have significant negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Cortisol Levels:** High levels of stress elevate the hormone cortisol in the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Elevated cortisol negatively impacts the skin's aging process and overall quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Oil Gland Activity:** Stress can also cause sebaceous glands (oil glands) to secrete more oil onto the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   **Reducing Cortisol:** To reduce long-term cortisol levels and improve skin quality:
    *   **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:** Focus on the quality of your sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Improving sleep can significantly reduce stress and enhance skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Meditate:** Regular meditation can also reduce stress levels and contribute to better skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

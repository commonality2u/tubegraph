The company one keeps plays a significant role in personal growth and success, particularly in maintaining confidence and navigating life's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. It is essential to be discerning about the people one surrounds oneself with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## The Role of Family and Friends

Being close to one's [[lessons_learned_from_family_and_relationships | family]] and parents is crucial, especially when confidence is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Additionally, cultivating friendships with individuals who genuinely motivate and encourage you is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Avoiding "Yes Men"
It is important to have friends who are not simply "yes men" but rather individuals who are willing to show you the "real picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Such honest perspectives can be invaluable for personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Self-Motivation and Partner Support

While supportive relationships are beneficial, self-motivation remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. No one, not even a partner, can fully motivate an individual; that drive must come from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### Personal Anecdote on Partner Support
In one instance, when expressing the desire to become an actor, a girlfriend laughed at the prospect, questioning how a living would be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This experience reinforced the idea that while a partner can be supportive of goals, the ultimate responsibility for motivation lies with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Choosing Your Company
The choice of one's company significantly impacts personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Individuals can either be uplifted or complicated by the people they associate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This decision ultimately rests with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, and making a sane choice is key to maintaining a clear mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Early Life Struggles and Support Systems

Early in a career, like working multiple demanding jobs in one's early 20s, personal struggles can include not talking to parents and feeling like a "hustler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[role_of_family_and_support_system_in_aashna_shroffs_career | a strong support system]] to navigate challenging periods.

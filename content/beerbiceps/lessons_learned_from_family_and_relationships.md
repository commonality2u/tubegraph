Priyanka Chopra Jonas attributes much of her strength and ambition to the [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | lessons learned from her family and relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Her upbringing instilled in her a strong sense of purpose, confidence, and perseverance.

## Influence of Family
Priyanka learned confidence from her mother and other strong family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They taught her that personal circumstances are less important than the size of one's dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Her parents actively supported her aspirations, ensuring she wouldn't have "what if" moments in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. They encouraged her to always have the confidence to communicate any mistakes she made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Father's Wisdom
Priyanka's father taught her the importance of "hustle" and not fearing failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. He emphasized that what defines you is what you do *after* a failure, not the failure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He encouraged her to find the courage to do things differently and learn from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. He instilled the "courage of conviction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, even humorously stating that if she ever killed someone, she should tell him, and he would help her bury the body before taking her to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

### Parents' Marriage
Priyanka's parents provided a model of an "extremely healthy marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Their [[lessons_learned_from_marriage | relationship]] was one of equals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Despite having separate responsibilities, they always worked together and showed mutual respect for each other's opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Decisions were made jointly, without one person's monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Key Learnings on Relationships
Priyanka emphasizes that honesty is paramount in all kinds of [[relationships_and_love | relationships]], whether with friends, family, or romantic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. She advocates for being genuine about one's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

> "The healthiest relationships happen when you have the ability to call out someone and say well that's not right or I don't feel a certain way and you're wrong or you're right and to be able to talk about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

This requires shedding the "cloak of being careful about your emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. In times of difficulty, especially regarding [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | mental health]], she stresses the importance of seeking support rather than isolating oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

> "It's important if you're feeling down dark deep to not keep it to yourself to not be alone. It's very important to find someone that you can talk to even if they can't help you it doesn't have to be a therapist it could be a mom it could be your friend it could be someone but don't do it alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>

This advice highlights the critical role of a strong support system in navigating [[family_life_and_parenting_challenges | life's challenges]] and overcoming personal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

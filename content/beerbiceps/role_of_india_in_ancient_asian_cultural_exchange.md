India has historically played a significant role in the cultural exchange and development of Asia, serving as a hub for trade, philosophy, and religion. Much of its ancient history, particularly that of the Indus Valley Civilization, remains underground in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Early Civilizations and Trade
The [[lost_history_and_archeological_mysteries_of_ancient_india | Indus Valley Civilization]], with a significant portion located in present-day Pakistan and India, was a primary civilization of India that engaged in direct contact with the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:40">[02:57:40]</a>. Its port city of Lothal in Gujarat facilitated trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia, indicating early transcontinental human interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>. Archeological findings include Mesopotamian seals in India and Indus Valley Civilization seals in Mesopotamia, demonstrating this active trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

The city of Dwarka, located off the coast of Gujarat, is described as a well-planned ancient city that could have served as a major trading port connecting India with Africa, Europe, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>. This city is now submerged underwater, but its exploration is a priority for the Archaeological Survey of India's underwater heritage efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:42">[02:54:42]</a>. These submerged sites are considered important "areas of interest" in archaeology because they represent initial points of connection with other civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>.

> [!info] The Quest for India
> Throughout history, many expeditions aimed to reach India due to its established importance. Christopher Columbus, for instance, was trying to reach India when he inadvertently found America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:03">[09:21:03]</a>. Every historical route map indicates an intention to come to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

## India as a Center of Knowledge and Philosophy
From the 6th to the 12th century CE, India was a "throbbing motherland of civilization, of culture, of intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. During this period, India boasted six grand universities: Nalanda, Vikramshila, Takshashila, Somapura, and Odantapuri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>. These institutions, both Buddhist and Hindu, attracted scholars from across Asia, including Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. Epigraphic evidence suggests that to study at Nalanda, a preliminary Sanskrit exam was required before traveling to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

The philosophical texts that emerged from India, including those from Kashmiri Shaivism and Varanasi, were "mind-bogglingly deep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. An archaeologist described her experience studying [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | classical Indian religion]] at Oxford, where she translated manuscripts like Abhinavagupta's *Tantrasara* and *Tantraloka* from the 9th-10th century Kashmir, which delved into Shaivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. The complexity of understanding consciousness and unpacking the human mind through these texts was profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

## Religious and Philosophical Influence Across Asia
Indian religions and philosophies were widely adopted in Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. The adoption of specific deities often served purposes of state-building, royal patronage, and deifying kings as theological heads of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

*   **Cambodia:** Angkor Wat, the world's largest temple, is a Vishnu temple built in Cambodia before a dedicated Vishnu temple was built in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Previously, Cambodia had primarily worshipped Shiva for 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. The shift to Vishnu was strategic, aimed at consolidating a large empire and signaling stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Tantric Buddhism:** A sudden shift to Tantric Buddhism occurred when the state was under attack, as this religion provided tools for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. This period also saw the largest building program in 12th-century Cambodia, which included not only temples but also the largest network of hospitals, indicating extensive warfare during the kingdom's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

> [!info] The Spread of Buddhism
> Buddhism, originating in India, spread significantly across Asia. It traveled via a Northern Route to Tibet, China, and Japan, and a Southern Route to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. However, Buddhism ceased to exist in India in the mid-medieval period, being largely "wiped out" or "erased" in three waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Universities like Nalanda and Vikramshila were set on fire, and their libraries burned, though some texts were rapidly taken to Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Architectural and Artistic Impact
Indian temple architecture, generally pyramidal and often phallic (like male temples), contrasts with circular Yogini (female) temples, symbolizing the union that leads to creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Even the Parliament of India building is designed after the Yogini Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. This architectural philosophy is evident in temples across India, including those in South, East, and West India, and Jain temples, where every design holds deep philosophical meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

[[ancient_indian_temples_and_their_advanced_construction_techniques | Temples]] like those in Khajuraho and Konark (Odisha) showcase extensive and often outrageous sexual imagery on their exteriors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This imagery, deliberately placed outside, reflects a cosmology of society and the universe, where sex is presented as a "fringe layer" of life that leads to creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. In contrast, the inner sanctum of these temples is often the simplest and most austere space, drawing visitors from external grandeur to internal silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

Beyond India, the influence of Indian mythological creatures is seen in Southeast Asian art. Sea animals called Makara, similar to dragons, are often depicted at temple entrances in places like Bali, symbolizing creation and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. These [[comparative_mythology_between_indian_texts_and_other_ancient_cultures | mythological creatures]] were likely created to explain powerful natural phenomena like typhoons and massive waves, which early seafarers could not comprehend scientifically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Such representations are also found in South America, suggesting [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | broader connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

Paranormal investigator Sarabjit Mohanty discusses various aspects of [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal investigations]] and [[scientific_investigation_of_haunted_locations | haunted locations]], with a focus on experiences in India. He emphasizes the importance of distinguishing genuine [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal experiences]] from psychological phenomena or misconceptions fueled by popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16">[31:16]</a>.

## Defining "Haunted" and Types of Spirits
Contrary to popular belief, a place being "haunted" simply means it is "frequently visited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09">[44:09]</a>. This can include good spirits that may be [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | helping]] people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39">[00:39]</a>, not necessarily evil ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:44">[56:44]</a>.

Spirits can be categorized into three types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>:
*   **Stuck in a loop:** Spirits who have no idea they are dead and continue their day-to-day routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11">[06:11]</a>. They often try to gain attention when their attempts to interact with their environment fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37">[06:37]</a>.
*   **Attention-seeking:** Spirits that need attention, not necessarily because they are malevolent, but because they are stuck and seek help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>.
*   **Voluntarily staying:** Spirits aware of their death and ability to cross over, but choose to remain for various reasons, such as revenge or helping family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00">[07:00]</a>. This concept is often depicted accurately in Bollywood films where spirits return to avenge their deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18">[07:18]</a>.

Spirits can be stuck in a time loop, for example, unaware that centuries have passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37">[10:37]</a>. This suggests that the concept of time does not apply in the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37">[10:37]</a>.

## Paranormal Investigation Methods
Investigators use specific devices to communicate with spirits:
*   **PSB7 Device:** This device scans radio frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55">[11:55]</a>, allowing control over scanning speed and direction (forward or reverse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10">[12:10]</a>. Reversing the scan helps filter out random radio broadcasts and isolate intelligent responses from spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44">[12:44]</a>.
*   **White Noise:** Spirits reportedly communicate through white noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>, which contains the entire sound spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15">[18:15]</a>. By manipulating the white noise, investigators can receive verbal responses from entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04">[14:04]</a>.
*   **Estes Experiment:** This experiment involves a person wearing noise-canceling headphones playing white noise and being blindfolded to block their most important sensory input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01">[52:01]</a>. This triggers other senses, making the person more receptive to [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | spiritual communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21">[52:21]</a>.

[[Paranormal investigation methods | Paranormal entities]] feed on EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), which can be found in electrical appliances and human energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51">[42:51]</a>. This explains why electrical devices often malfunction in haunted locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05">[43:05]</a>. EMF devices are used to measure these fluctuations, indicating the presence of [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | energies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32">[43:32]</a>.

## Notable Haunted Locations and Cases in India
Investigators have explored several [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | haunted locations]] in India:
*   **Kandala Graveyard:** A graveyard where German prisoners of war were buried, investigated by Sarabjit Mohanty's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00">[00:00]</a>. They encountered a soldier from the 1800s who was unaware of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09">[00:09]</a>.
*   **Hulker Bridge, Pune:** Considered one of the most [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | haunted locations]] in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18">[00:18]</a>, where a spirit named Shinas, stuck since the 11th century, was encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25">[00:25]</a>. He was a scholar who had been murdered by being mummified and thrown into a river while alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>. The team used a PSB7 device to communicate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20">[12:20]</a>.
*   **Mud Island and Marve Road, Mumbai:** Often cited as [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | deeply haunted places]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>, these locations are associated with the common misconception of a "white sari ghost" in India, a concept popularized by horror films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27">[03:27]</a>. The idea of a pure soul being white led to this imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>.
*   **Abandoned Church and Hospital in Nainital:** This investigation revealed a doctor from the British era who intentionally killed patients he predicted would die, experimenting on the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:04">[50:04]</a>. The adjacent church, though in ruins, still holds energy from those events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20">[50:20]</a>. During investigation, psychics sensed non-human entities and spirits scared to come out due to the presence of demonic entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:20">[51:20]</a>.

## Psychological vs. Demonic Possession
Many cases reported as demonic possession are often found to be psychological or the result of a human spirit manifesting aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01">[32:01]</a>. Investigators prioritize medical reports before intervening in suspected possession cases to rule out mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44">[36:44]</a>.

The phenomenon of "excited delirium" explains instances where individuals exhibit unusual strength or aggression, such as a mother lifting a car to save her child, or a girl throwing her parents due to exam fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35">[39:35]</a>. This involves tapping into inherent bodily strength during moments of extreme focus or stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16">[40:16]</a>.

## Demonology and its Link to Crime
Demonology is the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20">[30:20]</a>. Demons are considered "inhuman spirits" that have never walked the Earth or taken physical birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43">[30:43]</a>. In [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | Indian spirituality]], entities like *pishach*, *asur*, and *rakshasa* are seen as different forms of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58">[30:58]</a>. Across various religions, demons exist as figures to support the concept of divine light, instilling fear to encourage adherence to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59">[32:59]</a>.

Some serial killers, like Son of Sam, have claimed to be influenced by demonic entities or commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41">[28:41]</a>. Michael Taylor, a man who brutally murdered his wife and dog, was initially believed to be possessed and underwent an exorcism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09">[23:09]</a>. However, his actions could also be attributed to schizophrenia or underlying criminal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26">[34:26]</a>. Similarly, the case of Anneliese Michel (basis for *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*) raised questions about mental illness versus genuine demonic possession, with her parents and priests later charged with manslaughter for neglecting her psychological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01">[36:01]</a>.

## Positive Spiritual Energy and Protection
Places of worship like temples, churches, and mosques have higher EMF fields due to the collective energy of prayers and spiritual devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40">[47:40]</a>. The human body itself emits electricity through its nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01">[45:01]</a>, and collective prayer can concentrate this energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30">[47:30]</a>.

The "Mata Aana phenomena" in [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | India]] refers to a positive deity possessing an individual who is open to it, allowing them to channel messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17">[57:17]</a>. While some instances are genuine, others in rural areas might be faked by women seeking attention or expressing suppressed desires in a male-dominated society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

To counter negative energies, various protective symbols and [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | objects]] are used:
*   **[[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | Symbols]]:** In India, "Om" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> and "Swastika" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a> are commonly used. Other protective symbols include the Pentacle, Eye of Hamsa, Thor's Hammer, and the Celtic knot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   **Crystals:** Crystals are believed to have healing, protective, and shielding abilities derived from nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. They absorb negativity and need to be regularly charged, for instance, by moonlight or sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Meditating with intention can also activate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

Meditation is highly recommended as a powerful tool for self-protection and strengthening the mind and soul against the "world of darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

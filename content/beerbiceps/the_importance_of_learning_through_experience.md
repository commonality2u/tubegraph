The biggest [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | learning]] from one's life experiences is the continuous need to learn everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The more experiences gained in life, the better it is, as true education comes from experiencing things firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Beyond Formal Education

While formal education, such as learning surgery, provides foundational knowledge, genuine mastery and understanding come from practical application and personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Classroom learning offers a specific style taught by an instructor, but true [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | growth]] occurs when individuals learn in their own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Although the process may be difficult, it ultimately leads to a unique outcome, different from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Embracing Experimentation and [[learning_from_failures | Overcoming Failure]]

To achieve stability, continuous [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | evolution]] and experimentation are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Many people fear experimentation due to the possibility of [[learning_from_failures | failure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. However, it's essential to keep trying new things while maintaining one's core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### The Value of Effort

Giving 100% effort to any endeavor is vital, regardless of the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This dedication prevents future regrets of not having tried one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. If an effort doesn't succeed, the philosophy is to accept it and move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Prioritizing Experience

A key piece of advice is to actively seek out and experience things in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The more experiences one accumulates, the more they will [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | grow]] in any field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Stepping Out of the Comfort Zone

It is recommended to never refuse an opportunity and to step out of one's comfort zone to gain new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Even if an experience turns out to be negative, it can become a source of amusement and reflection years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Past "stupid" incidents are often remembered fondly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Ultimately, experiencing new things might even lead to life-changing insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

> "The more you experience, the more you will [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | grow]], no matter what your field is in, literally any field, just experience things, never say no to anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>

## Missing Life Experiences

Despite success, there can be a sense of missing out on common life experiences due to a demanding career. For instance, not learning how to drive or experiencing college life due to lack of time can lead to a feeling of absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The desire to live in a hostel or flat sharing environment stems from a wish to understand and experience the typical college life to better relate to and create content for that demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

In spiritual philosophy, the concepts of karma and predestined life paths are deeply interconnected, suggesting that nothing in the world is unfair. What appears as hard work or effortless success is a manifestation of visible and invisible karma carried by the soul across different lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Karma as a Determinant of Destiny

Karma, defined as one's actions, directly shapes destiny. What is perceived as a "predestined" life path is, in fact, the accumulated effect of past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Visible vs. Invisible Karma
Some individuals work extremely hard and still don't achieve success, while others find success easily without much effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This difference is not unfair, but rather a reflection of:
*   **Visible Karma**: The hard work seen in the current "costume" or lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Invisible Karma**: Good [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmas]] performed by the soul in previous "costumes" (lifetimes) that are not visible in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Therefore, success is not solely a result of current hard work but a cumulative effect of the soul's journey through lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Nothing is based on luck; everything is "pre-decided" by the [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] that the soul chooses to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## The Soul's Journey and Sanskars

The soul carries its [[understanding_soul_connections_and_karmic_relationships | karmic accounts]] and *sanskars* (nature or emotional patterns) from one lifetime to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. *Sanskars* are emotional patterns that come with the soul from past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Examples include:
*   Criticism or appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>
*   Doubt or trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>
*   Stability or reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>

A baby born with specific *sanskars*, such as being naturally smiling or grumpy, reflects the soul's nature from its previous "costume" or lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The soul begins each birth with its accumulated [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] and *sanskars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Astrological Charts as "Opening Balance Sheets"

Astrological charts are viewed as "opening balance sheets" of a soul's [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] and *sanskars* from previous lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. They predict future events based on the *sanskars* the soul has arrived with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. However, these charts represent probabilities, not fixed realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## The Role of Free Will and Meditation

Individuals are the creators of their own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. While past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] determines the "opening balance sheet," current actions can change one's *sanskars* and alter the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Meditation and spiritual practices are key to this transformation:
*   **Changing Response to Outcomes**: Negative [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmic]] outcomes will still manifest, but meditation helps one face them without suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. By raising one's vibration and changing one's present [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]], the individual can respond differently (e.g., being calm instead of reacting with anger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Cleansing and Creating Right Karma**: Meditation cleanses the mind and helps create positive [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Stamina**: Spiritual progress is measured by how one's feelings change in daily activity, not just during meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Developing "spiritual stamina" means being able to respond constructively even to difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

By consciously changing one's lifestyle and *sanskars*, individuals can alter their destiny and defy unfavorable predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This proactive approach prevents one from becoming a "victim of only that balance sheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Karmic Accounts and Relationships

Every person met in a close energy circle (friends, parents, siblings, romantic partners) has been met before in previous lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. Current relationships are influenced by past interactions and existing [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmic accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Bitter Karmic Accounts**: If past interactions were negative, the current relationship might start with discomfort or pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. These accounts will continue until one or both parties make an effort to change their [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Resolving Accounts**: Understanding [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmic connections]] simplifies life, shifting focus from blame to taking responsibility for one's current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. Meditation helps one set aside ego and initiate positive [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] in relationships, even if the other person doesn't reciprocate immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This actively settles past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmic accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

This applies to all significant relationships, not just romantic "twin flames" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Spiritual Growth and Transformation

The current era is described as a "paradigm shift" or "transition," moving from the peak of the Iron Age (Kaliyuga) towards the Golden Age (Satyuga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This transition involves a decline in internal values (ego, lust, greed, mental health issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, leading to an awakening for many souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

As individuals raise their vibration through spiritual practices like meditation, they radiate this energy into the collective consciousness, contributing to a planetary shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. A "tipping point" of a small number of high-vibration souls can overpower lower vibrations and shift the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This implies a cycle of rise and fall in collective consciousness, with a major transformation leading to a new Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.

This current period of upheaval is also a time of spiritual awakening, where the "old house crumbling" makes way for a "new house under construction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. Individual shifts contribute to the global shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[the_role_of_karma_free_will_and_destiny_in_spiritual_life | human experience]] of life is like clay that can be molded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>. By understanding and actively engaging with their [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] and *sanskars* through spiritual practices like meditation, individuals can take control of their predestined paths, transforming probabilities into a desired reality and contributing to a higher collective consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

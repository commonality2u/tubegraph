Dermatology has sometimes been trivialized, but the field is complex and involves understanding the science and craft of improving skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Effective treatment goes beyond quick fixes and focuses on the underlying causes of skin conditions like acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:08">[06:06:08]</a>.

## Understanding Acne Causes

Acne is a prevalent skin problem, particularly [[adult_acne_causes_and_solutions | adult acne]] in metropolitan areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>. While environmental factors like pollution play a role in skin allergies and eczema, acne is more directly linked to lifestyle, hormones, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:37">[33:37:37]</a>.

Key contributing factors include:
*   **Dietary Habits** [[impact_of_diet_on_skin_health | Dietary Habits]] –
    *   Excessive protein supplements can be inflammatory if not properly digested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:40">[07:43:40]</a>.
    *   Extreme dieting, such as zero-fat, zero-carb, or strict keto diets, can disrupt hormone cycles, leading to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:28">[08:25:28]</a>.
    *   Dairy products (excluding curd, ghee, and buttermilk), processed foods (like cheese and packaged proteins), and artificial sugars can cause inflammation and insulin spikes, leading to [[role_of_stress_in_skin_problems | hormonal disruptions]] that trigger acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:40">[21:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:27">[21:44:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:47">[36:06:47]</a>.
    *   Individual bodies differ, meaning foods that suit one person may not suit another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Stress** [[role_of_stress_in_skin_problems | Stress]] – Simple stress, including the societal pressure to look good, can significantly contribute to skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:46">[09:01:46]</a>. Stress hormones like cortisol can lead to an excess of adrenal hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:14">[42:19:14]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Imbalances** – These can lead to conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women, characterized by an imbalance in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), an increase in male hormones (DHE, testosterone, DHT), or elevated prolactin levels, all of which can cause angry, red acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:37">[38:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:31">[39:07:31]</a>. In men, higher testosterone levels lead to larger sebaceous (oil) glands and increased oil secretion, making them more prone to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:08">[40:29:08]</a>.
*   **Genetics** – Family history can predispose individuals to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:17">[41:04:17]</a>.
*   **Microbiome Disruption** – Both gut and skin microbiomes can be disrupted, leading to inflammation and conditions like acne or eczema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:34">[59:58:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

### The Gut-Skin Axis
The gut and skin are intimately connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. An unhealthy gut, often due to poor digestion or inflammation, can manifest as skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. Inflammation is the body's defense system responding to aggressors, but chronic irritation can make it counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:02">[25:34:02]</a>.

## Medical Approach to Acne Treatment

A legitimate and qualified dermatologist begins with a detailed consultation to understand the root cause of acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:14">[05:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:09">[13:59:09]</a>. Skin, hair, and nails serve as diagnostic tools for internal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:10">[28:08:10]</a>.

### Diagnostic Tools
*   **Clinical Examination** – A dermatologist can often determine the type of acne (e.g., cystic, inflammatory, blackheads, whiteheads) and potential underlying issues by visual examination, including steroid abuse acne or folliculitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:53">[45:51:53]</a>.
*   **Blood Tests** – These are typically ordered only when clinical signs suggest a hormonal imbalance (e.g., breast tenderness, disrupted periods, hair loss, facial hair growth, dark skin on the neck indicating insulin resistance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:50">[44:07:50]</a>.

### Treatment Modalities

1.  **Lifestyle Modifications** – Often the first and simplest step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
    *   Adequate sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
    *   Good scalp hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
    *   [[Impact of Diet on Skin Health | Diet]] monitoring: Keeping a food diary can help identify trigger foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.
    *   Stress management: Practices like yoga can balance hormones, calm the mind, and improve circulation, leading to better skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.
    *   Avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

2.  **Antibiotics** –
    *   Used for severe, painful, or infected acne to curb inflammation and infection, usually for a short duration (7-10 days, or pulse therapy for severe cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:00">[58:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
    *   Concerns about gut microbiome disruption are addressed by co-prescribing good gut bacteria (probiotics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:39:00">[58:39:00]</a>.
    *   Singapore once declared acne a pandemic due to widespread antibiotic resistance from long-term use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>.

3.  **Topical Treatments** –
    *   **Benzoyl Peroxide:** A common and effective treatment that stops bacteria growth and reduces oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:36:00">[47:36:00]</a>. It can be irritating, so proper usage (e.g., short contact therapy) is crucial to avoid dryness and redness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:50]</a>.
    *   **Retinoids (including Retinol):** Derivatives of Vitamin A, they increase cell turnover and repair cells, making skin look fresh and youthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>. They also reduce oiliness and clogging, helping with acne and scar reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:45">[01:36:45]</a>. Retinol is not for all skin types; it's best for thicker, oily, or acne-prone skin, but can irritate thin, dry, or sensitive skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>. Strict sun protection is essential when using retinoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>.
    *   **Steroids:** Topical steroids, available over-the-counter, should be used with extreme caution. Long-term misuse can lead to steroid-abuse acne, which is difficult to treat and not a true infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.

4.  **Oral Isotretinoin (Accutane)** –
    *   An oral form of retinoid (Vitamin A precursor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism:** It effectively dries out *all* glands in the body, including oil glands, tear glands, and mucous membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Highly effective for almost all acne, especially severe or hereditary cystic acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.
    *   **Precautions & Side Effects:**
        *   **Teratogenic:** Can cause harm to a developing baby, so women must not conceive while on this medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. Recent studies suggest it's not teratogenic in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:29">[01:40:29]</a>.
        *   Dries out lips, skin, eyes, and can cause hair fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
        *   Can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and derange lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>.
        *   Should be prescribed and monitored by a qualified doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.
    *   Some low-dose, long-term usage (e.g., 5mg daily) is being studied for anti-aging benefits, but monitoring by a doctor is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

5.  **In-Clinic Procedures** –
    *   **Intralesional Steroid Injections:** A tiny amount of steroid injected directly into a large, inflamed pimple to quickly suppress inflammation, often used for immediate relief for actors or public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. Must be done by a qualified dermatologist to avoid side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
    *   **Chemical Peels:** Involve applying different acids (e.g., salicylic, mandelic, TCA, vitamin C, ferulic, kojic, retinol) to the skin to exfoliate and remove dead layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">[01:47:55]</a>.
        *   **Types:** Very superficial (immediate glow), superficial (slight redness, irritation for short time), medium depth (rough skin, takes longer to recover), and deep peels (require bandaging, not suitable for brown skin due to high risk of pigmentation and scarring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>.
        *   **Benefits:** Clears complexion, reduces acne scars, fades imperfections, evens skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:43">[01:53:43]</a>.
    *   **Microneedling Radiofrequency:** Uses tiny needles to deliver radiofrequency energy at specific depths, shrinking oil glands permanently and stimulating collagen for scar reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>.

## General Skincare Guidelines

A comprehensive skincare routine should focus on three main pillars: cleanse, protect, and nourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.

*   **Cleansing:** More than just washing twice a day.
    *   Choose a cleanser appropriate for your skin type (e.g., avoid brightening washes with acids for dry skin, avoid overly drying salicylic acid for oily skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.
    *   Consider pre-cleansing with oil for heavy dust or makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
    *   Proper makeup removal techniques are vital to avoid irritation and clogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
*   **Protection:**
    *   **Sunscreen:** Essential for everyone to protect against UV, visible, and infrared light, which can cause pigmentation, faster aging, dehydration, and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. While early morning sun is beneficial for Vitamin D and happy hormones, strong midday sun is damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
    *   Moisturizers also offer protection against dust and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.
*   **Nourishment:** Provide what your skin needs to quench and calm itself, using ingredients like licorice or calendula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Not all natural ingredients are beneficial (e.g., common aloe vera may lack medicinal value or cause allergies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.
*   **Exfoliation:** Gently removing the top dead layer of skin once a week is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
    *   **Scrubs vs. Exfoliation:** "Scrubbing" is harsh and can damage the skin barrier; gentle exfoliation uses fine granules or chemical exfoliants (like AHAs/BHAs) to loosen dead cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Makeup:** Does not inherently harm skin, but improper application and hygiene (unclean applicators, old makeup) can transfer bacteria and cause irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. Disposable sponges are recommended over brushes for blending foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** Provides hydration to the skin, but can irritate very dry or sensitive skin. Best for normal, calm, or oily skin types needing moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:54">[01:37:54]</a>.

## Importance of Professional Guidance

Dermatology is a complex field, and self-treatment or relying on unverified online advice can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Seeking advice from a legitimate, qualified, and board-certified dermatologist is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:14">[05:33:14]</a>. Quality medical care is an investment, not a commodity to be bought on sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">[01:44:34]</a>.

Ultimately, while scientific treatments are available, it's essential to listen to your body and avoid excessive stress or self-inflicted harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>. Everyone experiences skin troubles, and modern science offers numerous solutions to improve skin health and enhance one's quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.

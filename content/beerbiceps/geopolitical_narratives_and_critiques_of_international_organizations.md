Sanjie Sanal, an economic advisor to the Prime Minister of India, discusses the influence of [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical narratives]] and the manipulation exerted by certain international organizations and powerful interests. He highlights how perceived "objective truths" can be swayed to control or deconstruct nations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>

## The Challenge of Information and Manipulation

Sanjie Sanal emphasizes that many strong opinions, especially those shared on social media platforms like YouTube, are often based on loose information, though some are well-researched and consider multiple perspectives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> The government is aware of channels that criticize them, viewing feedback as important, though filtering out ideologically or politically driven criticism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>

> "a lot of it is is just garbage they made it up because they want to manipulate you in some way and many of these International organizations deliberately do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>

He asserts that we have all become better at filtering information, but some content, including [[conspiracy_theories_and_lesserknown_historical_perspectives | conspiracy theories]], continues to circulate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>

### The Role of Algorithms and AI in Shaping Narratives

Algorithms are essentially equations designed to play out certain patterns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a> A significant danger is the assumption that these algorithms are objective truths. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>

Algorithms can be swayed in a particular direction, influenced by subjective factors, and manipulated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a> For example, Wikipedia entries, despite appearing objective, are edited by a hierarchy of ideologically tilted editors, leading to continuous tampering with entries of public figures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a> With AI models like ChatGPT, which are trained on existing data, there's a risk that they could provide answers that reflect inherent biases or manipulation, presenting them as objective truths. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>

*   **Geopolitical Weapon:** AI bots are seen as potential [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical weapons]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a> American companies owning algorithms means they can influence [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical narratives]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> While India possesses AI capabilities, creating a general open system like ChatGPT that achieves global clustering (where everyone uses it) is currently challenging due to the need for universal participation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>

### ESG Norms and Rating Agencies

Beyond algorithms, other subtle mechanisms influence global decision-making. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a> Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) norms are being pushed globally, particularly by Western governments, to be part of all decision-making for investment and large companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>

While ESG sounds positive, Sanal argues that its components (environmental, social, governance) are subjective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a> This subjectivity allows ESG rating companies to emerge and impose specific norms, forcing companies to make decisions in particular ways within a framework they've accepted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>

### Think Tanks and Narrative Control

Think tanks in the West, such as V-Dem in Sweden, Freedom House in the US, and Chatham House in London, actively create global narratives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a> These narratives can appear as "gospel truth" but are, in fact, subtly ingrained. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>

*   **Examples of Bias:**
    *   India, as the world's largest democracy, was ranked 108th by V-Dem, just above Pakistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>
    *   In a list of academic freedom, India was rated below Afghanistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>

These indices, even if unknown to the public, feed into other indices and ESG norms, systematically influencing decisions and potentially creating an "alternative reality." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a> It is crucial to create debate and push back against these influences to avoid being deconstructed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>

Sanal has published a working paper titled "Reversing the Gaze," which critically examines the data, methodologies, and systems of these international agencies, claiming many contain "kindergarten level mistakes" and systematically tilt towards a negative portrayal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>

### Foreign Influence and Regime Change

Sanal notes that powerful countries or interests, sometimes even at odds with their own governments, can exert influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a> He cites George Soros, an American billionaire of Hungarian origin, who has historically used his wealth to affect narratives and even changes in government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>

Sanal expresses suspicion regarding Soros's televised statements about investing "a billion dollars" to influence India, viewing it as a threat of [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | regime change]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> He highlights that for a country like India, which has experienced repeated colonization, such external attempts to dictate its path must be resisted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>

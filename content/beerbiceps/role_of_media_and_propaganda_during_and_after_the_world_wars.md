The **World Wars** were not only fought on battlefields but also in the realm of [[media_and_narrative_influence_on_public_perception | public perception]] and propaganda. The way events were reported, historical accounts were shaped, and narratives were controlled played a crucial role in influencing public opinion, demonizing enemies, and justifying actions.

## Critique of Traditional News and History
Traditional news media has often been criticized for not adequately reporting geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Many turn to alternative sources like podcasts and platforms such as Twitter for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. History books, too, are seen as incomplete, frequently omitting key facts, such as the significant involvement of Indian troops in World War I and World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### The Power of Narrative Control
A recurring theme in history is that the "winners always write history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:59:00">[39:59:00]</a>, portraying events and individuals in a way that serves their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>. This control of [[media_and_soft_power | narrative]] is a significant aspect of warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>, shaping what the public believes to be true. [[media_influence_on_politics | Media influence on politics]] is evident in how Western media is often seen as propagating state-approved perspectives, limiting true freedom of speech to only those views that align with the official narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>. Countries under the influence of major powers, like Germany and Japan after World War II, also present sanitized, state-approved perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>.

## Propaganda During and After the Wars

### The Demonization of Adolf Hitler
Adolf Hitler has become the face of evil in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:00">[41:04:00]</a>. However, it's argued that other historical figures, such as Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, were responsible for more deaths than Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. Winston Churchill is also cited as having caused more Indian deaths than Hitler caused Jewish deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>, through engineered famines and other atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>. The selective demonization of Hitler is attributed to geopolitical reasons, specifically because he fought against the Anglo-Saxon Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>, which has historically dominated global narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. Had Hitler been an ally of the US, his image might have been portrayed as a hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. This highlights the "son of a bitch" philosophy in geopolitics, where allies, regardless of their actions, are protected from negative portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.

### Hitler's Narrative and Symbols
To consolidate power as a nationalist leader, Hitler created a mythology around himself and the German people, portraying them as superior and wronged, with himself as the one to "right the wrongs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>.

*   **The Swastika:** Hitler chose the *hackenkreuz* (hooked cross) as the Nazi Party symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. Post-war, the British and Americans deliberately attached the Sanskrit word "swastika" to this symbol, despite its ancient and positive connotations as a symbol of auspiciousness in Indian, Japanese, Mongolian, Chinese, and Native American cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:03:00">[45:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22:00">[45:22:00]</a>. This deliberate association has led to the symbol being universally condemned and equated with Nazism and white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:38:00">[47:38:00]</a>.
*   **The "Aryan" Theory:** The Nazis also hijacked the Sanskrit term "Arya," meaning "noble person" in Indian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. Hitler propagated the false "Aryan Invasion myth," claiming that Germans and Nordic people were the "true Aryans" and the "Supreme Master race" destined to rule the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:09:00">[47:09:00]</a>. This pseudo-historical narrative was used to justify their ideology and expansionist ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:21:00">[47:21:00]</a>.

### The Japanese Empire and Hidden Atrocities
Textbooks often overlook the atrocities committed by the Japanese Empire during World War II, such as horrific experiments on human beings involving biological warfare agents, exposure to extreme cold, and other tortures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:31:00">[52:31:00]</a>. This historical omission is believed to be due to Japan's post-war alliance with the US, which allowed some of this information to be "erased" from history books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08:00">[49:08:00]</a>.

### The Enigma of Hitler's Death
The official narrative of Adolf Hitler's suicide is questioned due to a significant lack of convincing evidence, such as photographs of his body, which would have been a massive propaganda triumph for the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. This contributes to the conspiracy theory that he, like many other Nazi officers and soldiers, might have escaped to South America, particularly Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

## Modern Media and Counter-Narratives
In the age of podcasts and platforms like YouTube, there is a growing effort to "correct the history that we've been taught" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>. It is argued that audiences should seek out neutral, non-Western narratives, such as those offered from an Indian perspective, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of historical events and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>. Approaching subjects from multiple angles and using personal judgment are crucial to discerning the truth, which often lies somewhere in between differing perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. The continuous nature of [[chronology_and_impact_of_world_war_2 | geopolitical cycles]], like the "tough times create hard men" pattern, suggests that understanding history through diverse lenses is vital for predicting and navigating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

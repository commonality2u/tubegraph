Perception is often influenced by one's fashion sense, especially in formal settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Dressing too casually can lead to not being taken seriously, while dressing like everyone else may prevent you from standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. These [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules for formal dressing]] are designed to help you look your best for office or formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

There are two primary types of formal dressing:
*   **Traditional Formal Dressing:** Features very strict rules and is suitable for old-school office environments where fashion liberties are not typically given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Modern Formal / Business Casual:** Allows for more flexibility and options, enabling you to play around with the rules a bit more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

These are key [[differences_between_traditional_and_modern_formal_dressing | differences between traditional and modern formal dressing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Shirts: Color and Style Guidelines

### Traditional Formal Shirts

For traditional formal offices that adhere to strict rules, keep the following in mind:
*   **Colors:** Stick to white, shades of pink, or shades of blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Shades:** Always opt for lighter shades, as office environments are typically daytime situations, and lighter colors are preferred for daytime wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Darker colors are generally reserved for nighttime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Sleeves:** Avoid half-sleeve shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Patterns & Intensity:** Do not wear shirts with loud patterns or colors that are super saturated (high intensity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Traditional formal dressing emphasizes subtlety and sobriety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Modern Formal Shirts

For modern formal or business casual settings, where there is more leeway:
*   **Patterns:** While very loud patterns are still not recommended, you can incorporate very subtle patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The goal is to avoid anything too eye-catching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These are [[guidelines_for_wearing_pattern_shirts | guidelines for wearing pattern shirts]] in formal settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Colors:** Prioritize lighter shades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, for business casual, you can occasionally wear darker shades such as black, navy blue, brown, or shades of gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These can be considered [[basic_shirt_colors_every_man_should_own | basic shirt colors every man should own]] for modern formal attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Application:** These rules are mostly applicable to new-age offices or formal parties that allow for a more contemporary approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Only follow modern formal rules if your office or formal environment permits it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Pants: Color and Style Guidelines

### General Rules for Formal Pants
*   **Color Selection:** Be strict with your color selection. Recommended colors include black, charcoal gray, navy blue, and some shades of brown, such as super light tan, which can be paired with white or blue shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These colors are part of effective [[color_combinations_and_clothing_combinations | color combinations and clothing combinations]] for formal wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Shade Rule:** A very important [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | formal dressing rule]] is that the shade of your pants must always be darker than that of your shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This ensures that attention is drawn more towards your upper body rather than your legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Types of Formal Pants
*   **Traditional Formal Pants (Suit Pants/Trousers):** These are very formal-looking pants that can be worn in any office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Tailoring:** Always get your pants tailored to be tapered towards the base. The bottom of the formal pant should be slightly more sleek and thin, giving an overall leaner and sharper appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Chinos:** A cross between jeans and traditional suit pants, chinos are slightly more casual cotton pants that are tight around the thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. While chinos come in many colors, for formal wear, stick to the recommended darker shades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Belt and Shoe Matching
*   **Belts:** Avoid cotton belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Always opt for leather or faux leather belts with a leathery feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Prioritize black and dark brown belts for their versatility and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Matching Rule:** The color of your belt must always match the color of your shoes. It doesn't have to be the exact same shade, but it needs to be a similar color, e.g., light brown shoes with a dark brown belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This is a crucial aspect of [[matching_belts_and_shoes_in_formal_attire | matching belts and shoes in formal attire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Socks:** Match the color of your socks to that of your pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Shoe Color (Traditional):** For traditional formal dressing, the color of your shoes should be either the same shade as your pants or one shade darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Shoe Style (Modern):** For modern formal attire, consider brogues (formal shoes with a slight pattern), monk strap shoes (with buckles), or smart dark-colored loafers, which can be worn for both parties and the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Investing in high-quality formal footwear is recommended for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Ensure shoes are always well-polished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Wristwatches in Formal Attire
A wristwatch is an essential accessory for formal dressing; no formal outfit is complete without one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Traditional Formal:** A good quality metallic watch is preferred, serving as a power symbol for meetings and super formal events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Modern Formal:** You can wear watches with leather straps and slightly thinner dials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **General Rules:** Avoid digital watches, very thick and eye-catching dials, and straps with patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

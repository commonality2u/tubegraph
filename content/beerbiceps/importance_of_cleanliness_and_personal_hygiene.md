Looking handsome, particularly for Indian men, is less about innate physical features and more about presenting as neat and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The focus should be on looking clean and well-kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Women generally associate cleanliness with looking good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, and the aim is to appear as if one has recently bathed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Hair Care

*   **[[importance_of_haircuts_and_styles | Haircuts]]**: [[importance_of_haircuts_and_styles | Haircuts]] significantly impact how scruffy one looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. For many Indian men with rough hair, growing it out is not advisable unless it is silky smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. To appear neat and classy, a "golden haircut" with a slightly long top and short sides is recommended, as seen on athletes like Virat Kohli and Cristiano Ronaldo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The most important rule is to always look neat and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Facial Hair Grooming

*   **Primary Facial Hair**: Getting your facial hair right is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Beard**: Options include growing a full beard and maintaining it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, or styling it (e.g., a goatee or soul patch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Mustache**: Avoid mustaches, especially as a young man, as they can make you look like a "child molester" rather than just older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Mustaches are considered historic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Clean Shaven**: The "evergreen" and safest approach is to be clean shaven, as nothing conveys cleanliness and tidiness better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
        *   **Shaving Tips**: A good quality razor is essential for a clean shave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Features like strong, durable blades, a good grip to prevent cuts, and spring-mounted blades for precision (especially around pimples) are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Facial Hair**: Many people neglect secondary facial hair, which is often noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Ear Hair**: A common issue for Indian men, which can be shaved off with a regular razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Nose Hair**: Trimmed with super narrow, sharp small scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Unibrow**: Many Indian men have a unibrow, which can negatively impact one's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Tweezers are recommended for removing the thickest hairs in the middle of the eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. It's important to leave a few strands of hair for a natural look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, ensuring the face appears to have two distinct eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Face Cleanliness

*   **Daily [[face_washing_routine_and_products | Face Wash]]**: A basic, mild [[face_washing_routine_and_products | face wash]] is the first weapon against an oily appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
    *   It helps remove oil, which if accumulated, increases pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   Young men (teens, early 20s) and gym-goers are more prone to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
    *   Washing the face twice daily (morning after waking, and 1-2 hours before bedtime) significantly prevents and minimizes acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
    *   Rub the [[face_washing_routine_and_products | face wash]] deep into the skin and rinse with tepid (room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

## Occasional Skincare

*   **Bonus [[the_importance_of_exfoliation_and_skincare_routines | Skincare Routine]]**: For important occasions like office meetings or parties, an additional [[the_importance_of_exfoliation_and_skincare_routines | skincare routine]] can enhance neatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Moisturizer**: Use sparingly if you have oily skin, as excessive use can block pores and cause acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. It helps rehydrate the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Baby Powder**: Preferred over regular talcum powder due to its fine granules, which do not block pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Use sparingly as too much can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
    *   This combination can reduce the oily appearance of skin, serving as a subtle form of men's makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. If too much is applied, it can be wiped down with a slightly wet cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

## Hand and Nail Hygiene

*   Women often gauge cleanliness by looking at one's hands and feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. While feet may not always be exposed, hands always are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   **Nails**: Keep nails short and clean, removing any dirt from underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Clean nails convey cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Calluses**: For those with calluses from activities like gym-going, a little moisturizer rubbed into the hands can help get rid of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## Fragrance

*   **Men's Fragrances**: Fragrances are a significant factor in appearing handsome because women associate you with your smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. For first encounters and impressions, wearing perfume is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

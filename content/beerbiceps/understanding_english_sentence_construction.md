To [[improving_english_fluency_and_confidence | improve your spoken English]], a key focus should be on understanding English sentence construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Ranveer believes this is more important than merely expanding vocabulary or learning "big words" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Sentence Construction

Many people prioritize learning new words, but the emphasis should first be on how English is naturally spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Understanding sentence structure provides the foundation upon which vocabulary can later be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## How to Observe and Learn

The process of understanding sentence construction begins by observing English as it is used by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

*   **Consume Varied Content**
    *   Watch easy video content like cartoons or sports commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
    *   Listen to radio and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   Read simple English texts, such as a 10th-standard ICSE textbook with short stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
    *   Choose content you genuinely enjoy to make the [[practicing_english_through_media_and_content | practice]] enjoyable and sustainable for at least 15 minutes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

*   **Actively Observe Differences**
    *   As you consume content, pay close attention to how sentences are constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
    *   Notice instances where the sentence structure differs from the way you would think or speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mental Notes and Repetition
> Every time you spot a difference in sentence construction, make a mental note of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Recognize that this is a mistake in your own speaking patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. To internalize the correct construction, repeat it to yourself about 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Order of Learning

This observational approach to sentence construction is step two in the recommended process for [[improving_english_fluency_and_confidence | improving spoken English]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Only after you have gained an understanding of how English is spoken and sentences are constructed should you then focus on learning new vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This ability to understand spoken English comes from consistent practice of absorbing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

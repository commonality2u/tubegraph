This article outlines a basic skincare routine focused on natural and herbal solutions to combat acne, blemishes, skin bumps, and general skin irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The recommendations prioritize honesty and consumer power over brand sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

A proper face washing routine is crucial for [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | healthy skin]] and preventing issues.

### Frequency
Wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before going to bed and once in the morning after waking up, or after reaching your office or college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you engage in cardio or activities that cause a lot of sweating (like football or cricket), you can wash your face a third time after your session, but ideally stick to twice daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Choosing a Face Wash
Always opt for a 100% herbal face wash. While mild face washes were previously recommended due to limited herbal options, now large brands are producing herbal alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, be cautious as many "Ayurvedic" products from big companies might only contain Ayurvedic ingredients, rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Recommended brands for 100% natural, Ayurvedic, herbal products include:
*   **Budget-friendly:** Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   **Higher-end:** K Aura, Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

### Washing Technique
It is preferable to wash your face after shaving or showering, as the pores on your skin are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to effectively clean and close them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Herbal face washes also provide nutrition to the skin, which can absorb ingredients like the body absorbs nutrients from food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

1.  **Amount:** Use a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel (e.g., aloe vera gel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
2.  **Application:** Rub the face wash between your hands and then apply it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
3.  **Regions and Motion:**
    *   **Cheeks:** Apply in a circular motion for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck:** Continue applying in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **T-Area (forehead, nose, chin line):** Rub in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   **Purpose of Circular Motion:** This increases blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes skin growth, and helps clean dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Pressure:** Be gentle but firm; avoid pressing too hard or too light to prevent damaging the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  **Dwell Time:** For herbal face washes, allow the product to sit on your face for about a minute to let it work its magic before washing off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
5.  **Water Temperature:** Wash your face with room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature, but not hot) water. Hot or freezing cold water can damage your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Moisturizers and Their Effects on Acne and Bacteria

Natural moisturizers are recommended for all skin types (dry, regular, oily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Unlike chemically made moisturizers, which can clog pores, increase acne, and harm beneficial bacteria on the face, natural options maintain the balance of good and bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Your face naturally contains good bacteria that fight acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Chemically made products might act as disinfectants and destroy both good and bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Application Tools
Always use clean cotton balls for applying moisturizers to avoid transferring dirty bacteria from your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Recommended Natural Moisturizers
1.  **Rose Water:** This acts as a disinfectant and can be applied twice a day: once before going out and once at night before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Khadi is a favored brand, though rose water products are widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
2.  **Lime Juice:** Squeeze about half a lime into a bowl, dip a cotton swab, and apply to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Usage Frequency:** Do not apply more than once or twice a week, as it is stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Fights acne and helps fade blemishes (acne marks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Sensation:** It may sting slightly, indicating it's working. If too strong, mix with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  **Aloe Vera:** This is a powerful, magical medicinal plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   **Preparation:** Tear open a piece of the plant, squeeze or scrape out the pulp/gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Application:** Apply the gel onto your face, possibly mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   **Usage Frequency:** For extremely dry skin or bad acne, use once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   **Sensation:** May cause a slight stinging sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Targeted Anti-Acne Products

While natural moisturizers offer long-term acne prevention, specific products are useful for active, painful pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Cautions with Antibiotics
Antibiotics like Clinda, available at general stores, can be used for active acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. However, long-term overuse can destroy the beneficial bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. It's recommended to turn to natural herbal oils first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Low-Density Skin Oils
These oils are designed for skin and pimples, unlike dense oils such as coconut oil, which can clog pores and worsen pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Types:** Sweet almond oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, rose hip oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, or tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** They are meant to reduce inflammation. When applied to a pimple, they are absorbed, reducing inflammation and redness, and helping the pimple heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Recommendation:** Always try these low-density oils first before resorting to antibiotics, and never overuse antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Diet and Lifestyle Factors

Diet and lifestyle play a significant role in [[adult_acne_causes_and_solutions | managing acne]] and overall skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Dietary Recommendations
*   **Avoid:**
    *   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
    *   Junk food or restaurant food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
    *   Packaged fried snacks (often full of *maida*, dirty oils, and trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
*   **Include:**
    *   More vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
    *   More fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   **Balance:** Do not overdo any single type of food, whether non-vegetarian, eggs, or specific vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Lifestyle Factors
*   **Stress Reduction:** High stress levels elevate the hormone cortisol in the bloodstream, which negatively affects skin, aging, and causes oil glands to secrete more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. To reduce cortisol long-term:
    *   Focus on [[sleep_hygiene | sleep hygiene]] (quality of sleep) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   Meditate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    Both meditation and quality sleep can reduce stress levels and improve skin quality, being as important as other skincare factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

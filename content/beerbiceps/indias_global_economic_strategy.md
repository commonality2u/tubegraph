[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]], India's Minister of External Affairs, emphasizes the growing public interest in [[geopolitical_discussions_related_to_india | foreign policy]] and [[geopolitical_discussions_related_to_india | geopolitics]] in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. He attributes this increased engagement to pervasive global connectivity through technology, where daily interactions and consumption patterns are influenced by global content and comparisons, a phenomenon he calls "globalization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Rebranding India Globally

[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]] highlights Prime Minister Modi's significant role in reshaping [[international_perspectives_on_india | India's branding on a global stage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He describes the Prime Minister as personally transformative, having radically "churned the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Modi's unique quality lies in his ability to combine grand strategic visions and revolutionary concepts with meticulous attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This dual approach makes working with him both interesting and challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Economic Challenges and Foreign Policy's Role

India faces multiple global challenges simultaneously, including the aftermath of COVID-19, the Ukraine conflict and its impact on energy, food, and fertilizer inflation, and ongoing border issues with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. There is also the persistent issue of terrorism emanating from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]] emphasizes that [[indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] is not merely an academic exercise but directly impacts every Indian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. His department's goal is to ensure [[indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] benefits individuals by securing them during travel, assisting them in problems abroad, and facilitating opportunities like student work visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

Foreign policy also plays a crucial role in marketing and branding India globally, making it a magnet for business by assuring the world that India is responsible and safe for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

## Building National Competitiveness

At its core, India's economic strategy hinges on building fundamental competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. This means developing strong domestic capabilities in:
*   **Manufacturing:** Establishing factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurship:** Fostering businesses and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.
*   **Agriculture:** Strengthening the agricultural sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure:** Investing in smart ports, good roads, and efficient movement of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

These internal strengths are vital for India to compete globally, not just with China, but with other nations like Vietnam, which may be economically smaller but compete effectively in specific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. Initiatives like "Make in India," "Startup India," and "Gati Shakti" are crucial for creating jobs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. The overall message to the youth and entrepreneurs is to "Chase Excellence, create employment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, as individual excellence contributes to national excellence in the "global sport of [[geopolitical_discussions_related_to_india | geopolitics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

## Technology and the Global Workplace

[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]] acknowledges the profound impact of technology on [[geopolitical_discussions_related_to_india | geopolitics]] and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. He views artificial intelligence (AI) as a "mega process" for analyzing patterns, offering a significant advantage similar to a cricketer predicting every delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>. While quantum computing is discussed, the more immediate focus in diplomatic conversations is on semiconductors, seen as "the new oil," and the ongoing "Chip War" or "Tech War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.

A key aspect of India's global strategy is preparing for an era of "trusted collaboration" regarding critical and emerging technologies. This involves countries with similar systems (market economies, democracies) creating secure supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.

Prime Minister Modi consistently advocates for India to view the world as a "global workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. This vision aims to open up opportunities for talented Indians abroad, regardless of their profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. There is a high demand for "trusted talent" â€“ skilled people who play by the rules and understand international business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>.

To facilitate this, India has signed mobility agreements with countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and is working on similar agreements with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. The concept of the "global workplace" no longer strictly requires physical relocation; employment or services can be rendered remotely, blurring geographical boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>.

## Addressing Brain Drain

[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]] reframes the "brain drain" discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>. Instead of seeing it as a choice between India and abroad, he views the world as a "membrane" where people can move in and out freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. The traditional fear of not being able to return after working abroad is diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. He believes that in many industries, opportunities within India are becoming increasingly competitive, sometimes even better than those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. The example of Apple's manufacturing presence in India demonstrates an improved business atmosphere and validates the quality of Indian talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>. Additionally, major Indian companies are showing increased confidence in investing domestically rather than primarily hedging abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.

## Message to Young Indians

[[dr_jaishankars_role_in_indian_diplomacy | Dr. Jaishankar]]'s message to young Indians, including aspiring leaders and digital content creators, is one of self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. He states that the current era offers unprecedented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. He encourages them to consider the interconnectedness of national and personal choices, asserting that "a good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>. He believes it is the obligation of older generations to "open that up as much to prepare it as much to create that kind of favorable ground" for the youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>. He also notes that leadership can now emerge from young people, as confidence and a fresh perspective can appeal to all generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.

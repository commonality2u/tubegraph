Parents often hold evolving perceptions regarding their children's unconventional career paths, particularly in fields like online content creation. Initially, there can be a significant lack of understanding and concern for the future [00:02:33].

## Initial Misunderstanding and Evolving Views
Initially, parents of the "Slayy Point" founders viewed their YouTube activities as merely "posting memes on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, a "random thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, or just "having fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, their perception began to change as they observed their children:
*   Engaging in public speaking and interacting with others, which improved their "speaking skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> [00:02:48].
*   Communicating with brands and managing business aspects, leading to an understanding that they were "learning about money and business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

For now, parents allow their children to pursue YouTube because they recognize the significant "real life" skills being acquired in a specific industry [00:03:00].

## Parental Concerns and Demotivation
Despite growing recognition, parents frequently voice significant concerns about the long-term viability of unconventional careers. They express [[the_motivation_behind_managing_multiple_careers | uncertainty]] about the future, stating it's hard to "put numbers to it or predict exactly what's going to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Common demotivating statements from parents include:
*   "It's not going to last anyway, so why do you want to put so much effort?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Suggestions to "just do Masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, implying the YouTube path "won't be fruitful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Doubt in their ability to "run a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Concerns about future fame: "After 5 years you won't be famous anymore or after 10 years you probably won't be famous anymore and you won't get as many views then what will you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>

These parental remarks can be very demotivating for young entrepreneurs [00:03:38].

## Children's Response to Parental Concerns
The children understand that parental concerns stem from a natural desire to protect them from an "uncertain" path [00:03:46]. To counter this, they actively try to prove the viability of their career by:
*   Demonstrating financial success through "brand deals and the money that's coming in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Showcasing audience engagement, such as "fan following and the people who are watching our channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

While parents may not overtly show pride, they secretly wish for their children's YouTube growth [00:04:32]. They often hold back overt encouragement to ensure their children remain "grounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> and "humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, preventing them from getting "carried away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> by their early success [00:04:12]. They also frequently remind them that despite their achievements, they are "still 21 and still my child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The Role of Academic Performance
[[family_life_and_parenting_challenges | Parental expectations]] regarding academic performance play a crucial role. For the Slayy Point founders, maintaining good grades was never an option to compromise on, as their parents would not have allowed them to continue with YouTube otherwise [00:10:22]. The speakers noted that their academic marks actually "increased since we started doing YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, attributing this to improved time management and prioritization skills learned from balancing multiple demands [00:10:50]. This dedication to both studies and their YouTube venture highlights [[the_motivation_behind_managing_multiple_careers | the importance of discipline and preparation]] in satisfying parental expectations while pursuing non-traditional careers [00:10:04].

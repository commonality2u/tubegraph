This article is based on the first part of a three-part special on [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] with Medha Bhaskar Ma'am, a researcher who has dedicated 20 years to studying [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] and the history of India [01:15:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>). This initial episode focuses on the [[socioeconomic_conditions_of_india_before_the_rise_of_shivaji_maharaj | state of India before Shivaji Maharaj's empire began to form]] [01:30:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>).

## Understanding the Term "Shivrai"

The term "Shivrai" is used as a respectful, shorter form for [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] [04:55:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>). It encapsulates the full title, with "rai" meaning "raja" or king [05:05:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>). This term is used to make it easier to refer to the legend in interviews and conversations while still honoring him [04:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>).

## India Before Shivaji Maharaj

To understand [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]'s mentality, history, and conquests, it is crucial to understand what India was like before his time [03:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>). The historical context spans from about 1000 years before his birth, focusing on the mentality of the people and the impact of continuous invasions [06:36:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>).

### Geographical and Political Landscape (12th-17th Century)

*   **Mughal Empire:** In the North, the Mughal Empire controlled 22 provinces [07:37:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>). Their rule extended from Madhya Pradesh to the borders of Maharashtra [08:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>).
    *   **Mansabdars and Jagirdars:** The Mughal administration heavily relied on a system where 80% of the empire's land was granted to *mansabdars* (warriors) and *jagirdars* [07:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>). These individuals were responsible for cultivating the land, collecting taxes (primarily from agriculture), and maintaining a cavalry force for the King [07:07:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>). This system effectively outsourced the army [07:23:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>).
*   **Deccan Sultanates:** Below Maharashtra, the Deccan region was divided among several Sultanates:
    *   Ahmednagar's Nizam Shahi [08:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>)
    *   Bijapur's Adil Shah [08:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>)
    *   Hyderabad's Qutb Shahi [08:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>)
*   **Vijayanagara Empire:** Further south, the Vijayanagara Empire, ruled by Hindu kings, was almost vanishing by the time [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] was born [09:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>). While it still existed, it had become very weak [09:24:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>).

### Mentality of the Indian People Before Shivaji Maharaj

For approximately 500-600 years leading up to the 17th century, the average Indian lived with immense fear and suffering [13:59:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>).

*   **Impact of Invasions:** India, particularly the North, suffered numerous invasions for about 800 years [12:17:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>).
    *   Early Indian kings, like King Jaipal in Kabul, were defeated by invaders from Central Asia (Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan) [10:34:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>).
    *   The invaders often had better tactics, including horse cavalry, which was superior to India's elephant cavalry in certain terrains [11:24:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>).
    *   Despite a larger population, Indians were easily outnumbered due to a mentality of internal rivalries among Hindu kings and a forgiving, secular approach [10:40:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>). They would even tolerate invaders attacking their neighbors [11:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>).
*   **Brutality and Loss of Self-Esteem:** Invasions led to mass killings, the taking of women and children as chattel property and sex slaves, and severe brutality [13:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>). This long period of subjugation led to a loss of self-esteem and a "secondary citizen" mentality among the populace [13:38:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>).
*   **Vulnerability:** The common terms of the era, "Sultani Calamity" (raiders) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disaster), highlight the widespread insecurity and fear [23:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>).
*   **Portuguese Influence:** Similar to the Islamic invasions, the Portuguese in Goa (15th-16th century) forcibly converted and "brainwashed" locals, making them forget their religion, festivals, and lifestyles, leading to significant cultural change [14:19:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>). Refusal to convert led to torture [14:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>).

### Researching History

Researching this historical period relies on several sources:

*   **Contemporary Correspondence (Cusp Watt):** This is considered the best way to research, involving letters between people at that time [15:40:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>). Historians learn languages like Persian, Sanskrit, and Modi script (an old Marathi script) to read these documents [16:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>).
*   **Tamar Patra:** Writings etched on metal sheets, similar to "etching in stone," also provide valuable information [17:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>).
*   **Bakhars:** These are historical accounts often written by court members who were paid by kings, potentially leading to biased, filtered narratives [18:26:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>).
*   **Historians' Works:** Researchers rely on the works of dedicated historians, like Sir Jadunath Sarkar (who spent 50 years studying [[Aurangzeb]] and the [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | relationship between Aurangzeb and Shivaji Maharaj]]) [19:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>) and Gajanan Mehendale (who studied Modi and Persian for his research on Shivrai) [19:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>). It's important to view history from a 360-degree perspective, using intellect, empathy, and instinct to "read between the lines" [19:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>).

## The Mughal Empire and its Rulers

The podcast delves into the nature of Mughal rule, particularly focusing on the perception versus reality of its emperors.

### Mughal Military and Economy

The Mughal Empire was at its peak during [[Aurangzeb]]'s rule, holding immense military and economic power [01:16:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>).

*   **Vast Army:** The Mughal army boasted 200,000 heavy-duty cavalrymen, 40,000 artillery men, and foot soldiers [01:16:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>). Their equipment included helmets, full armor, javelins, heavy-duty swords, and shields [25:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>).
*   **Caravans:** Mughal military campaigns involved massive caravans that could stretch for miles, with a vanguard in one village and a tail guard in another, creating an optical illusion of overwhelming force [27:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>). These caravans included:
    *   Road cleaners and tree cutters [26:05:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>)
    *   Camel cavalry and foot soldiers [26:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>)
    *   Camels carrying luxurious tents and equipment for the Badshah and high-ranking mansabdars [26:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>)
    *   Thousands of oxen carrying food, sheep, and goats for provisions [26:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>)
    *   Families, concubines, and children accompanying the army [26:59:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>)
*   **Wealth Extraction:** The Mughals extracted massive wealth from their provinces, particularly from agriculture, which was the primary industry [08:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>). About 20% of the total earnings went directly into the emperor's coffers [01:06:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>). For example, the Mughal Empire collected 12 million rupees (silver coins, each about 10 grams) from 22 provinces, equivalent to 93,000 kg of gold, valued at $3.5 billion USD today [01:05:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>).
*   **Ruthless Administration:** Approximately 80% of the Mughal Empire was under the rule of military men (mansabdars) [01:07:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>). These mansabdars were ruthless warriors who often acted as "mini-kings," and their presence instilled fear in the local population, making it difficult for common people to receive justice [01:07:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>).

### Emperors and Their Cruelty

*   **Akbar:** Despite romanticized depictions in films like *Jodha Akbar*, Akbar was reportedly very cruel [29:26:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>). He killed subordinates, including women, to achieve his desires [30:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>). Films often "hide the truth" or only show positive aspects, leading to historical inaccuracies becoming perceived as real history by audiences [30:38:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>).
*   **Salim (Jahangir):** Salim, Akbar's son (later Emperor Jahangir), was also extremely cruel [00:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>). He tortured and blinded his own handsome and secular son, Khusrau, who was favored by Akbar and wanted to bypass Salim for the throne [35:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>). Saltwater was poured into Khusrau's eye sockets to inflict excruciating pain [00:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>). Khusrau was later killed by his half-brother, Shah Jahan [36:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>).
*   **Shah Jahan:** Shah Jahan himself killed 36 people, including Khusrau, to secure his claim to the throne [36:16:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>).
*   **[[Aurangzeb]]'s Ascent to Power:** The Mughal succession had no fixed rule, meaning any son could become king, leading to brutal power struggles where "it was either the throne or the grave" [38:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>).
    *   **Family Conflicts:** [[Aurangzeb]]'s rise involved intense conflict with his brothers. His father, Shah Jahan, tried to limit [[Aurangzeb]]'s power by sending him to less fertile provinces like Kabul, while his favored son, Dara Shikoh, received rich lands like Punjab and the Ganges belt [44:37:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>).
    *   **Strategic Alliances:** [[Aurangzeb]], a brilliant military tactician, outsmarted his brothers [46:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:49:00">[46:49:00]</a>). He cleverly used religion to his advantage, portraying Dara Shikoh (who was intellectually interested in various religions) as an "idolator" and "non-believer" [52:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>). He convinced his younger, drunken brother Murad to join him by promising him the throne [52:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>).
    *   **Elimination of Rivals:**
        *   **Dara Shikoh:** He was defeated by [[Aurangzeb]] and Murad's forces at Agra [55:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[55:10:00]</a>). Dara fled but was eventually caught by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, brought back to Delhi, tried under Sharia law, and beheaded [01:00:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>). His "crime" was writing a book, *Mingling of Two Oceans*, which discussed the meeting of two religions [01:00:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>).
        *   **Murad:** He was executed after a trial, likely by hanging, possibly due to opium addiction induced in prison [01:15:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>).
        *   **Shah Shuja:** He was killed by "cannibals of Arakan" (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma border), a strong hypothesis states his family was eaten by them after being driven deep into Bengal by [[Aurangzeb]]'s forces [00:34:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>), [01:08:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>).
        *   **Suleiman Shikoh (Dara's son) & Muhammad Sultan ([[Aurangzeb]]'s son):** They were imprisoned and died in Gwalior Fort [01:15:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>). Muhammad Sultan died of depression at 36 [01:15:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>).
    *   **[[Aurangzeb]]'s Bravery:** [[Aurangzeb]] was a skilled warrior who earned his right to the throne through his military prowess and political acumen [01:12:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>). He was known for being ruthless and intelligent in using people and religion to his advantage [00:57:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>), [01:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>).

### Mughal Torture Methods

Mughal prisons were infamous for their brutal torture methods:

*   **Blinding and Saltwater:** Victims had their eyes removed, and saltwater was poured into the sockets for prolonged pain [00:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>).
*   **Sharp Instruments:** Feet were dismembered with sharp instruments, even from pregnant women [01:07:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>).
*   **Opium Poisoning:** In Gwalior fort, prisoners were given a drink made from opium seeds (post), which gradually deteriorated their mind and body [01:17:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>).
*   **Venomous Snakes:** Prisoners, along with their families, were sometimes thrown into dungeons with venomous snakes [01:13:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>).

### Mughal Military Tactics

Mughal armies, trained by Portuguese, used advanced weaponry for their time [01:16:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>).

*   **Cannons:** They employed lightweight cannons that could be moved quickly on the battlefield, firing both explosives and large iron cannonballs to destroy structures [01:16:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>).
*   **War Elephants:** Elephants were sometimes given opium (post) and had heavy iron balls with spikes chained to their trunks [01:11:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>). These maddened elephants were then released into enemy ranks, causing intentional casualties and chaos [01:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>).

### Racial Discrimination in the Mughal Army

The Mughal army consisted of diverse groups, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkistanis, who were perceived as fairer and better-looking, and thus were paid more [01:19:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>). Indian Hindus and Marathas, with darker skin, were paid less, indicating racial discrimination even then [01:20:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>). Some Siddhis from Africa were also part of the army, but were not a major force [01:20:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>).

Despite the perceived "villainy" of figures like [[Aurangzeb]], the podcast argues that understanding the circumstances and the harsh realities of the time is crucial [01:13:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>). The vision of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]], who thought of creating his small Swaraj (self-rule) against such a powerful enemy, becomes highly relevant in this context [01:18:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>).

Actor Sanjay Dutt openly discusses his past struggles with drug addiction, describing it as a "roller coaster ride" and a "difficult life" he wouldn't wish on anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He views his journey as one of learning from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Initiation into Drugs
Dutt's entry into drug use was driven by a desire to "be in the scene" and "be cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. He admits to being a very shy and aloof person, especially with women, and believed drugs made him a "cooler guy with the ladies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. He recognizes that he was one of the few people who developed an addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## Types of Drugs and Effects
Sanjay Dutt engaged in "real hardcore kind of drug abuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, going beyond marijuana or alcohol. His drug use included:
*   Rin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>
*   Cocaine (an "upper" that makes one talkative and feel like "one of the guys") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>
*   Heroin (a "downer" that caused "winkies" or nodding off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>
*   Uppers and Downers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>
*   Quaaludes ("Quus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>

He recounted that when he was taken to rehab in Miami, he had tried every drug on their list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. He believes his upbringing and parents' care helped him survive such an extreme period, as doctors stated it was impossible for anyone to do that kind of stuff and live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Even today, he cannot consume cannabis, despite its legalization in some places, due to his "addictive personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

While his mind remained "intact," the physical effects, known as "flashbacks," lasted for about four years after rehab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. These flashbacks occurred because the body stores drug deposits in fat content, which would be released, causing him to feel a high randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Path to Recovery
Dutt's recovery began when he made up his mind to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. During his "intense drug addiction," he became a "loner" living in a "cocoon or shell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. He spent two years in a rehab center in the Bayou Country of Jackson, Mississippi, a rare duration for patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. He initially struggled to accept he was a drug addict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

His realization came when he participated in group activities like boating and barbecuing with other patients. He began to understand that "this is what life is" and that he had missed out on ten years of his life spent hiding in his room or bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. This epiphany marked the turning point in his recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

The film [[Sanju|Sanju]] depicted Dutt's post-rehab phase, where he used his addictive personality to develop positive habits like working out, transforming his physical appearance from "chi" (weak) to a "guy with a swag and C body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. He believes this is a way to "beat it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

## Advice to Others
Sanjay Dutt offers strong advice to those dealing with drug addiction:
> "There's no better high in life than what life is. There's no better high in life than your mother and father or your family, your brother, sister... there's no better high than work... these things are just escapism... if you guys are men and if you guys are strong, face that whatever problems you have in your life head on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>

He emphasizes that while drug addicts often have "addictive personality disorder," this can be channeled into positive pursuits like workouts, career, or spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. His overarching message to the younger generation is: "Be strong, listen to your parents, study hard, stay away from drugs, and please don't follow my life because it's not a heroic life, it's difficult. So, learn from it but please don't follow it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

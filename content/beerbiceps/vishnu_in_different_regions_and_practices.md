Vishnu, the deity of sustenance and the universe, is revered across various regions of India and beyond, with diverse forms and worship practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The understanding of Vishnu extends beyond his common portrayal as the "all-encompassing God" (Parabrahma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>.

## Essence of Vishnu and Sanatan Dharma
The core essence of Sanatan Dharma posits that deities are manifestations of a single reality, capable of shifting shapes according to their will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Vishnu embodies playfulness and divinity, encapsulating a vastness that transcends simple definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. He is associated with expansion, derived from the root word "Vishwam" (universe) and "Vapam" (to spread), representing constantly moving and radiating consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. This concept is visualized by the image of reclining Vishnu with a lotus emerging from his navel, from which Brahma creates the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.

Vishnu is considered the ruling deity of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>, analogous to [[Shiva in Hinduism | Shiva]] as the deity of fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. His connection to water is seen in his reclining posture on a serpent bed in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. As the sustainer, Vishnu ensures the universe's continuation, a role connected to his various avatars that nourish different aspects of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>. His interest in Earth is purely out of love, as he married Bhudevi (the Earth), representing tangible resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">[02:37:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.

## Vishnu's Avatars and Regional Worship

While many are familiar with [[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] and [[Krishnas life and teachings | Rama]], Vishnu's earlier avatars are less known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Vishnu manifests to restore balance in the universe, either by vanquishing negative forces or responding to the devotion of his followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

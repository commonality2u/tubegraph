Sarvesh Shashi, recognized as one of India's leading young entrepreneurs, attributes his success to his practice of celibacy and [[benefits_of_semen_retention_and_nofap | NoFap]]. He claims to have followed the "no sex and [[nofap_movement_and_its_psychological_impact | NoFap]]" rule for nine years and genuinely believes it has endowed him with a "superpower" to achieve his aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Genesis of the Practice

Shashi's life took a significant turn at the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Before this, his life was characterized by "arrogance and attitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He had started yoga at six years old to improve balance and focus for his dream of playing cricket for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. At 17, he began taking his father's unfinished yoga classes, where he met his guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

His guru introduced him to five core precepts, asking for a commitment to follow them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Shashi had previously completed various "sadas" (disciplines) like 40 days of silence or meditating nine hours a day, which consistently led to positive life advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This success motivated him to commit to the five precepts:

1.  **No Intoxication**: Abstinence from alcohol, smoking, and non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing**: Neither physical nor mental (coveting others' possessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Not even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy**: This was the most challenging precept due to his age and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Initially, Shashi understood celibacy as "no sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He had never had sex before, so he thought it would be easy for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, his guru clarified that the commitment was for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, and later specified it meant "no getting physical, no fap, no masturbation, no ejaculation at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Despite the daunting nature of this commitment during his "prime time," Shashi honored his promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. For the first 1.5 years, he aimed to prove his guru wrong, but after that, it became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. He started this practice at 18 and has not broken any of the five precepts, continuing beyond the initial seven-year commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Benefits of Semen Retention and NoFap

Sarvesh emphasizes that the observed changes are a cumulative result of all five precepts, not just celibacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. He highlights the following benefits:

*   **Increased Energy and Stamina**: A general feeling of being energetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Creative Thought and Brain Activation**: Semen retention is described as taking the energy from the lower chakras upwards to the brain, opening a new dimension of creative thought and right-brain activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This has positively impacted his performance in cricket and his profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Increased Confidence**: The practice can lead to increased confidence in social and professional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Attractiveness and Magnetism**: He has been told that [[the_benefits_of_semen_retention_and_celibacy | semen retention]] makes one more attractive and magnetic, possibly due to energy rather than physical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Women are drawn to him because they feel safe, trusting his internal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Shift in Attraction**: His definition of attraction has changed, moving beyond superficial physical traits. He encourages introspection on why attraction is fleeting and focused on physical aspects rather than compassion or empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Managing Lust and Urges

Even after years of practice, Sarvesh admits he still experiences lust and horniness, as he is not "enlightened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. However, he is conscious of these feelings and knows how to transform them into compassion and love, causing them to fade away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

He, along with the interviewer, suggests a simple yoga exercise for those starting [[nofap_movement_and_its_psychological_impact | NoFap]] when experiencing lust:
*   Sit in one place.
*   Take a deep breath in, visualizing the energy flowing upwards through the spine into the brain.
*   Breathe out, imagining that energy spreading through the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
This technique helps re-channel sexual energy into creative energy, a concept taught in advanced meditation schools like Osho School, Isha Foundation, YSS, or Chinmaya Mission School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Sarvesh faced numerous temptations, particularly during his time traveling with the IPL as a professional cricketer, where accessibility to situations that could break his precepts was high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. He recounts extreme instances, like women changing clothes in front of him, to which he would respond by leaving the room, stating he "can't do much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## Intuition and Manifestation

Sarvesh believes his spiritual and clean lifestyle has significantly enhanced his intuition, or "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. He has experienced remarkable instances where his truthful statements or desires have seemingly manifested. For example:
*   He once told a friend she would get her London visa on a specific date (December 25th) and leave the next day (December 26th), which precisely happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
*   His prediction about a friend wearing red instead of black for an event came true when her black dress accidentally burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   He openly spoke about wanting to do his first movie with Christopher Nolan and having prominent yoga practitioners like Jennifer Lopez invest in his company. Both seemingly impossible dreams later materialized; Jennifer Lopez became an investor in his company, and he even flew with her on a private jet to her concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

He attributes these occurrences to manifestation, believing that if one believes in something, they can make it happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. He clarifies that he never consciously uses intuition for his career, as spirituality (Adhyatma in Hindi) means "coming to oneself" and "being in the present." Actively seeking intuition for future gain would contradict being present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. He maintains that everyone possesses intuition; some simply realize it because they are not blocked by intoxicants or negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The "third eye" or Ajna chakra is the sixth chakra in the body, and opening it through practices like pranayama, meditation, and yoga enhances intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Daily Practice and Life Lessons

Sarvesh practices an intensive meditation based on *Anapana* (focusing on natural breath), which helps him stay in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. He believes that even 30 seconds of focused meditation can lead to a different stage of being, increasing focus levels in waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. He asserts that one hour of yoga a day can energize a person for the remaining 23 hours, reducing the need for extensive sleep to just 4-6 hours, as quality is more critical than quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

From his journey, Sarvesh offers three key life lessons:
1.  **Be True and Authentic to Yourself**: Despite external pressures, remain authentic and take the first step towards your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
2.  **Practice Self-Care (Physical and Mental)**: There's a thin line between being selfish and selfless. One must care for themselves to effectively care for others, encouraging a mix of physical activities (like gym or functional training) and mindful practices (like breathing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person**: Especially in business, understanding and managing people is crucial. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good employer or team member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

These three principles, combined, lead to becoming a more compassionate person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Sarvesh's motivation for starting his yoga company, Diva Yoga (and SVA, its mother brand), stemmed from the profound personal changes he experienced, compelling him to spread the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. His philosophy culminates in the sentiment: "Love like there is no tomorrow, and if tomorrow comes, love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

In Indian society, there is a significant [[cultural_identity_and_misconceptions | cultural misconception]] that associates the ability to speak English with intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is considered a "flair" within Indian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## English and Intelligence

This perception is rooted in 200 years of British rule, which ingrained the idea that English is linked to intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This is described as a "very wrong mentality to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Unlike countries like Germany where people speak German or Japan where people speak Japanese, India uniquely holds this strong association of English with intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The speaker himself notes that while his English serves as his "thinking language," his perceived fluency comes from clarity of thought and confidence, rather than a vast vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Judgment and Insecurity

A common behavior observed is that many Indians readily judge others' English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This judgment is often a reflection of the critic's own insecurity and a way to boost their ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It is advised to disregard such criticism and focus on self-improvement, accepting that making mistakes is perfectly acceptable and a part of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Shifting Generations

While the older generation, particularly parents, might express concern if someone cannot speak English well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, there's a growing acceptance among the younger generation of mixing Hindi with English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Pride in Native Languages

It is emphasized that individuals should be proud of their own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Not speaking English perfectly is considered "not that big a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If one gets stuck while speaking English, it is acceptable to complete sentences in Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The ideal is for Indians to speak their native languages such as Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Major Vivek Jacob is regarded as one of India's most respected Special Forces veterans, often described as a fierce and battle-hardened soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. His experiences in the [[cultural_and_operational_dynamics_of_the_indian_army | Indian Army]] have given him a profound understanding of life, combat, and philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Role and Philosophy of Special Forces (SF)

Major Jacob describes Special Forces as the "highest efficiency part of the [[cultural_and_operational_dynamics_of_the_indian_army | Indian Armed Forces]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. SF soldiers are distinguished by their exceptional psychological and physical capabilities, honed through rigorous and supplemental [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that being in the Special Forces is fundamentally about a "mindset" that evolves over time as individuals navigate numerous emotional, psychological, and physical obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. At its core, this mindset stems from the realization that "everybody is special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

SF serves as a "directed energy" for national security, capable of applying concise and precise force to resolve specific issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Their mandate is incredibly broad; they can be tasked to do "anything anywhere anytime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. This often involves "creative destruction," where operations are executed with precise parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. The secretive nature of their work means many details cannot be shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. An illustrative mission might involve a stealth operation to eliminate a target across the border with minimal casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

## [[combat_experiences_and_challenges_faced_by_major_vivek_jacob | Combat Experiences and Challenges]]

Major Jacob shared several intense [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat experiences]]:

### The Mine Incident
During an operation after over a decade of service, Major Jacob experienced a profound sense of discomfort and anxiety for the first time, a feeling he couldn't logically explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. This internal battle turned into extreme anxiety over several hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. Despite the urge to retreat to comfort, he stayed put, only for an explosion to occur shortly after, resulting in one of his teammates losing a leg to a mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
This incident plunged them into chaos far from base, with a severely wounded brother bleeding profusely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. He describes such situations as a "f*** up" in the SF environment, where a teammate is shot, maimed, or dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:10]</a>. In such moments of chaos, survival depends on entering a flow state, surrendering to the situation, accepting it, and then leveraging awareness to make life-or-death decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>. His choice was to immediately enter repair mode: administering morphine, setting up an IV, stemming blood flow, bandaging the wound, and assessing the damage to prolong the teammate's life until extraction and surgery were possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

### Teammate's Head Injury
Major Jacob recounted an incident involving a young, pure-hearted, and courageous soldier who sustained a severe head injury during a head-on engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>. The enemy's bullet hit the soldier's bulletproof helmet, causing it to collapse and crack his skull with such impact that his eye popped out and hung from its socket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. Despite this horrific injury, the soldier instinctively killed the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

After being extracted and hospitalized, the soldier lost all his memories, including those of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>. For many months, he was "lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>. When Major Jacob visited him, the soldier would look at old photographs of himself, struggling to reconcile his former handsome, athletic appearance with his disfigured face and lost eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>. His engagement broke off due to the injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. He was re-assigned to a cushy job running a canteen, a stark contrast to his past as a "super soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:48:00">[33:48:00]</a>. This profoundly impacted him, making his heart heavy and leading him to self-judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>. Years later, Major Jacob observed that the soldier had recovered much of his former self, having accepted his new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>.

### Artillery Shelling
[[Combat experiences and challenges faced by Major Vivek Jacob | Artillery shelling]] is described as "terror in supreme form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>. The whistling sound of incoming shells is terrifying because if the whistle stops, it means the shell is falling directly on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>. When a shell explodes, the metal casing disintegrates and melts due to intense heat, scattering razor-sharp fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. Major Jacob narrowly escaped death when an artillery shell exploded outside his bed, sending a line of molten shrapnel across the wall just above his sleeping area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.

### Near-Death Experience on a Cliff
Major Jacob recounted a moment of intense fear when he was stuck on a narrow ledge of a cliff, hanging onto grass for support, with a deep drop below and a waterfall nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. He was carrying a heavy rucksack and his weapon, and his new shoes were dangerously slippery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>. At this vulnerable moment, he saw an enemy soldier looking directly at him, signifying that his life was "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.

In that instant, he experienced a "flash" akin to a near-death experience, where his entire life replayed before his eyes like a photo album with videos, but without any emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt â€“ purely a detached observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>. This "time dilation" allowed him to perceive years of his life in no measurable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>. He ultimately survived the situation, despite it being an "impossible" escape, due to an "alternative form of reality" where the exact opposite of what should have happened occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

## [[philosophical_insights_and_spiritual_aspects_of_being_a_soldier | Philosophical Insights and Spiritual Aspects]]

Major Jacob views his entire life, including his [[major_vivek_jacods_tenure_and_experiences_in_the_indian_army | military career]], as a culmination of his DNA, childhood experiences, and professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. He has undergone a personal transformation, moving from "collecting things" to "letting things go," including concepts and perceptions of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. He believes life is a journey from understanding to realization, culminating in living a blissful and heavenly manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. He notes a similarity between monks and Special Forces veterans in their ability to discuss profound topics like consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:04]</a>.

### Flow State and Intuition
In [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat]], soldiers often enter a "flow state" where there is no past or future, only the present moment and the task at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a>. This state allows them to shed all concepts of duality (life/death, good/bad) and operate with singular focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.

Over time, Major Jacob developed a "sixth sense" or intuition, which allowed him to predict when something was going to happen in a combat scenario, sometimes hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>. This intuition emerged as he learned to surrender to the situation, letting go of all ideas of past, future, life, and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:41:00">[42:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. He believes this is linked to entering a spiritual dimension where awareness expands, allowing information to pour into consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:14:00">[43:14:00]</a>.

### Awareness and Chaos
In moments of extreme chaos, such as active combat where bullets are flying unpredictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>, the key to survival is heightened awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>. This means surrendering to the truth of the situationâ€”that it's "anybody's game"â€”and accepting the possibility of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07:00">[52:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:18:00">[52:18:00]</a>. From this detached, objective perspective, one can perceive infinite possibilities and identify the single opportunity that can change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:45:00">[52:45:00]</a>.

## [[military_experiences_in_international_settings | Experiences in Nature and with Animals]]

Major Jacob notes that [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military life]], especially in the Special Forces, constantly immerses individuals in raw nature, far from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>. Soldiers merge with nature not just physically but also at a deeper consciousness level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.

### The Leopard Encounter
During a night-time surveillance mission in a dangerous forested mountain, Major Jacob was on Sentry duty, staring into the darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:39:00">[57:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04:00">[59:04:00]</a>. After about an hour and a half, he heard a noise very close by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:21:00">[59:21:00]</a>. Using his night vision goggles, he discovered a leopard sitting less than a meter away from him, looking in the same direction he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:00">[59:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01:00">[01:00:01:00]</a>. He immediately prepared his weapon, but after about four to five minutes, the leopard calmly got up and walked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49:00">[01:00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51:00">[01:00:51:00]</a>.
He believes this peaceful coexistence occurred because both he and the leopard were immersed in the present moment, operating without complex thoughts or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37:00">[01:05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42:00">[01:05:42:00]</a>. Soldiers in the field, who may not bathe for weeks, align with nature's smells, making them less of an anomaly to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03:00">[01:06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31:00">[01:06:31:00]</a>.

### The Bear Encounters
Major Jacob described bears as potentially terrifying animals with immense strength, long, sharp claws, and speed, capable of tearing a person apart with one swipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19:00">[01:07:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32:00">[01:07:32:00]</a>. A mother bear with cubs is considered the most dangerous in Indian forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18:00">[01:08:18:00]</a>.

He recounted an instance where his team encountered a mother bear with two cubs, and despite expecting an attack, she calmly walked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44:00">[01:08:44:00]</a>. This suggests an alignment between wild animals and special forces soldiers, possibly because soldiers exude no fear and their movements or smells indicate they are not to be messed with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09:00">[01:09:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37:00">[01:09:37:00]</a>.

In another intense bear encounter, while observing an area at night in a high-altitude forest, Major Jacob found himself unknowingly on the path of two bears, near their cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19:00">[01:10:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58:00">[01:14:58:00]</a>. One bear, after initially attempting to climb around the soldiers, charged directly at them, stopping just two meters away and roaring into Major Jacob's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57:00">[01:13:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57:00">[01:15:57:00]</a>. During this terrifying five-second encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31:00">[01:18:31:00]</a>, Major Jacob remained in a flow state, ready to fire only if the bear swiped, to avoid compromising the mission with gunfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42:00">[01:18:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39:00">[01:16:39:00]</a>. A teammate behind him used a laser light from his weapon to flash the bear's eyes, causing it to stumble backward and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33:00">[01:17:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42:00">[01:17:42:00]</a>.

## Siachen Glacier
Major Jacob's posting to the Siachen Glacier immediately after his NDA and IMA training was his most intense experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21:00">[01:30:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:34:00">[01:30:34:00]</a>. He describes the environment as living "inside a fridge," where everything freezes instantly, including water thrown in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31:00">[01:31:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33:00">[01:31:33:00]</a>. Exposed skin burns and loses sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53:00">[01:31:53:00]</a>. Besides enemy action, the glacier itself is fraught with dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29:00">[01:32:29:00]</a>.

## Post-Military Initiatives

Major Jacob is involved in "Soul of Steel," an initiative that combines military mountaineering and combat experiences with adventure and mountain climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07:00">[01:57:07:00]</a>. This program teaches a range of skills, including unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, survival, and navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32:00">[01:57:32:00]</a>. The goal is to create "human ability biomes" to help individuals, from those with disabilities to Olympic athletes, realize their full potential and godliness within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12:00">[01:58:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19:00">[01:59:19:00]</a>. This, he believes, will lead to more open human beings who spread love, joy, and peace in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36:00">[01:59:36:00]</a>.

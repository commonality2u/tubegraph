Understanding how to choose and wear graphic or patterned t-shirts can significantly impact your overall look, contributing to the [[tshirt_maturity_scale_and_ageappropriate_dressing | t-shirt maturity scale]] and perceived style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Patterns and the T-Shirt Maturity Scale
The presence of a pattern on a t-shirt is one of two primary factors influencing whether it makes you look younger or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Younger Look:** T-shirts with a lot of patterns tend to make you look younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. If you are in college, you can afford to wear more graphics and patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Combination Effect:**
    *   A dark t-shirt with a pattern does not significantly alter whether you look older or younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   A bright-colored t-shirt with a lot of patterns will make you look very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Rules for Graphics on T-Shirts
When choosing t-shirts with graphics, adhere to specific color rules for a polished look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Two-Color Maximum Rule
Ideally, go for a maximum of two colors in your graphic t-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This means:
*   One base color for the t-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   One simple color for the graphic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Black graphic on a red t-shirt, blue on black, or white on green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Incorporating a Third Color
If you want to wear a t-shirt with a graphic that contains two colors, any third color should be minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   The third color's purpose is to bring out the overall pattern and the t-shirt's natural base color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** A common mistake is choosing patterns where a third color is dominating, which can ruin the overall aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Avoiding Logos
It is generally advisable to avoid t-shirts with prominent logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Judgment:** People may judge you based on the brands you wear. Flaunting a budget-friendly brand can lead to negative perceptions, while flaunting a high-end brand can make you appear ostentatious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics:** T-shirts generally look better without any logos, as simplicity is considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

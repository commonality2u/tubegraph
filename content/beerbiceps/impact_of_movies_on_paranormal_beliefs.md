Movies and media significantly influence public perception and experiences of the paranormal, often creating misconceptions and shaping expectations of what encounters with spirits or demons might entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Paranormal investigators report numerous cases where individuals believe they are experiencing something supernatural, but are, in fact, influenced by what they have seen in horror films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Misconceptions in Indian Horror Films

In India, a prevalent misconception, often stemming from horror movies like *Raaz* or *Fear Files*, is the image of a "white sari" clad female ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This concept became popular after the Ram Brothers' generation, who focused more on monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The idea behind the white sari is linked to an ancient belief that a pure soul is white, and thus, a soul leaving the body would appear as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Movies are also often criticized for misrepresenting the extent of damage entities can inflict on a body or environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Hollywood's Portrayal vs. Reality

While films like *The Conjuring* are considered among the closest to realistic paranormal depictions, they still incorporate "creative liberty" to maintain fear and entertainment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The 1974 case of Michael Taylor, who murdered his wife after an exorcism, is often cited as a potential example of demonic possession, but could also be attributed to schizophrenia or underlying criminal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. Similarly, the famous case depicted in *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* (based on Anneliese Michel), where a girl died during an exorcism, was later revealed to be a case of manslaughter due to the parents and priest failing to acknowledge her psychological illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Paranormal investigators emphasize the importance of medical and psychological evaluations before considering demonic possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Psychological Impact of Media Consumption

The content consumed, especially before sleep, can heavily influence one's subconscious mind, leading to vivid dreams or perceived experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. Many supposed possessions are merely the psychological effect of what a person has seen or a situation they are experiencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. An example of this is "excited delirium," a psychological term explaining superhuman strength exhibited in moments of extreme stress or focus, as seen in movies like *Bhoot* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Authenticity and Responsibility in Filmmaking

Filmmakers sometimes incorporate real satanic mantras or symbols for authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. However, responsible practitioners advise taking precautions, such as shielding the set or using protective symbols, to prevent unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. The existence of fake practitioners in the paranormal field contributes to a negative societal perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

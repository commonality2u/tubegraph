Robert Kiyosaki, author of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, frequently discusses the fundamental [[Differences between capitalism and communism | differences between capitalism and communism]], often contrasting his own capitalist mindset with what he perceives as communist or socialist ideologies in society and government.

## Defining Ideologies

Kiyosaki identifies himself as a capitalist, aligning with figures like [[Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. His definition of capitalism involves the ability to earn and multiply money to achieve mental freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. He believes capitalists own commodities like oil wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

In contrast, Kiyosaki describes communists and socialists as people who believe in giving people money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> and lack a "money building mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He states that many school teachers are Marxists or communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, and his "poor dad" was a communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. These individuals, he claims, believe everyone should be equal and share everything, which Kiyosaki dismisses as "lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Impact on Society and Economy

Kiyosaki asserts that the actions of leaders reveal their true ideology, rather than their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. He criticizes President Biden, labeling him a communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, and attributes specific policy decisions to this ideology.

### The Pipeline Example
As an "oil guy," Kiyosaki cites the example of President Biden cutting off a pipeline running from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Kiyosaki was selling oil for $30 a barrel at the time, and after the pipeline was cut, the price rose to $130 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:00">[00:00:38]</a>. He interpreted this action as a deliberate move by Biden to "destroy the middle class" and create only two classes of people: the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He reiterated this example later, calling it a deliberate act by a "communist" to create rich and poor classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Financial Education and Fake Money
A core tenet of Kiyosaki's teachings is the importance of financial education, which he believes is lacking in traditional schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He argues that schools, influenced by Marxist teachers, do not teach about money because they don't want people to realize that modern currency (like the dollar, rupee, or peso) is "fake money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. He considers this "fake money" to be "toilet paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He argues that people working for this "fake stuff" is a cause of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Kiyosaki advises people to invest in "real money" like silver and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> and assets like real estate, Bitcoin, cattle, and oil wells, rather than working for "fake money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. He champions Bitcoin for its "integrity" due to blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:25">[00:22:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Integrity

Kiyosaki's personal philosophy, shaped by his military background as a pilot in Vietnam, emphasizes fighting for freedom and upholding integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. He fought against communists in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and now fights with education to promote financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. He believes in direct, truthful communication, even if it leads to being hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

He highlights the importance of integrity, defined as one's body, mind, words, heart, and actions being in sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. He measures his life by the good he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> and aims to teach people to make money legally, ethically, and morally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

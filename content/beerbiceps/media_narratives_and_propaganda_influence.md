## Introduction to Narratives
States build narratives that can be both long-term and short-term, serving specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. An example of a long-term narrative is the historical portrayal of India as a "land of snake charmers," implying inferiority compared to the West, which positioned itself as powerful, rich, and possessing democratic values, fairness, and generosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. This narrative suggested that India's cultural and intellectual heritage was not original but brought by others, a story that "sold for a long time in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

## Methods of Influence
[[role_of_media_in_shaping_political_narratives | Media narratives]] are constructed through various means, including the strategic use of information and psychological impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

### Open Source Intelligence and Social Media
While intelligence agencies collect specific information, about 90% of total information comes from open sources, accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The skill lies in combining this publicly available information with additional, specific intelligence to gain a comprehensive understanding and predict future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Open sources include tools like Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> and especially [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_changing_societal_norms | social media]], which is extensively monitored by intelligence agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

[[soft_power_and_media_influence | Social media]] acts as both a tool for information collection and a "weapon of influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. It can be used to psychologically impact populations, twist stories, and spread misinformation, as seen with platforms like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Indian audiences are likely targets of Chinese and Pakistani intelligence agencies that twist narratives on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### Manufactured Intelligence and Conditioning
States can manufacture intelligence and create stories that are then widely disseminated to achieve specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. The goal is often to condition the minds of the target audience to accept a particular narrative, even if it's not the complete truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. If a large number of people understand the "game" of narrative building, it becomes harder for these efforts to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### The Iraq War and Oil
A notable example of a manufactured narrative is the justification for the Iraq War, which centered on claims of Saddam Hussein possessing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Al-Qaeda operating in Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. This narrative facilitated intervention under the guise of a "war on terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. The underlying intention, however, was related to oil; Saddam Hussein's decision to sell oil for euros rather than dollars threatened the US's control over global oil markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. By manufacturing intelligence and spreading this story, the US was able to attack Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. However, this intervention led to unforeseen complications, including a stronger Iranian presence and a broader regional conflict in Syria, which eventually drew Russia into the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. This demonstrates how narratives can be built to serve financial or geopolitical goals, portraying the intervening power as a "superhero" while the true motivations remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

### The Ukraine War and Dollar Pressure
The conflict in Ukraine highlights a shift in global narrative acceptance. Unlike past interventions, a large number of people globally have remained neutral regarding who is the "hero" or "villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. This neutrality, combined with international sanctions, has prompted countries to trade in different currencies, putting pressure on the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. Discussions about a BRICS currency and the US Treasury Secretary acknowledging dollar pressure indicate a superpower facing challenges to its abilities and finding it difficult to navigate the changing geopolitical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

### Portrayal of Dictators
[[influence_of_movies_on_perspective | Media content]], such as the Netflix show "How to be a Dictator," can also serve as a form of [[soft_power_and_media_influence | propaganda]] by portraying historical figures in an excessively evil light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. This reinforces long-term narratives and conditions public perception. Similar to how repeated exposure to an image makes someone more desirable, constant exposure to a particular narrative makes it accepted as "truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. It's suggested that these portrayals often omit the economic motivations behind US interventions in countries led by these "dictators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

## Impact and Countermeasures

### Distrust of Mainstream News
Recognizing that [[indian_journalism_and_media_representation | mainstream media]] often presents a partial truth or manufactured narratives, some individuals choose to stop consuming traditional news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. Podcasts are suggested as an alternative means of information gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>.

### Resilience and [[reevaluating_historical_narratives | Geopolitical Influences on National Policies | Geopolitical Narratives]]
Western analyses of countries like Russia and China often predict their collapse, mirroring past predictions about the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. However, these narratives frequently underestimate the resilience of these nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. For instance, the enduring Russian strength, evident in their resistance against Hitler during the Siege of St. Petersburg for a year and a half on meager supplies, demonstrates a deep-seated belief in themselves that allows leaders like Putin to continue their actions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Similarly, China, as a civilization, has a historical comfort with autocratic rule, which Western observers may not fully understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Big countries and civilizations do not simply "die away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### [[public_perception_and_polarization_in_india | Public Perception and Governance in India]]
The perception of a "safer India" and a "tiger's branding on the world stage" for the current government is attributed to a combination of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. Visible delivery on promises for the common person, such as widespread digital payment adoption (e.g., PhonePe), access to banking, and subsidies, contributes to public satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Initiatives like providing gas cooktops and toilets improve health, time, and dignity for beneficiaries, making a significant difference to a sizable portion of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. Furthermore, the government's outreach to countries like those in West Asia has significantly improved relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. Actions such as the Balakot counter-attack after the Pulwama incident served as a clear message that India would retaliate, changing the "tune" of its adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This assertive stance, unlike the perceived inaction after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has fostered self-pride and confidence within the country, leading to a stronger international image where other nations think twice before provoking India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. This improved security is a combination of both a strengthened security apparatus and public support from a satisfied populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.

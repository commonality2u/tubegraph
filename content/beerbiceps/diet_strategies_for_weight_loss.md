This guide focuses on the dietary side of weight loss, emphasizing that how you look and your weight primarily depend on your diet. While exercise can contribute about 20% to 30% to the overall weight loss journey, diet is the main factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Core Principles of Weight Loss Dieting
Weight loss is not about following a fixed meal plan, but rather about understanding food science and making informed food decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To lose weight successfully, especially in an environment where junk food and desserts are prevalent, the diet must be enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Long-term adherence to a plan is only possible if you find enjoyment in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The fundamental principle for [[caloric_deficit_and_weight_loss | losing weight]] is the caloric theory: your calories out must consistently exceed your calories in each day until you reach your target weight, thereby creating a [[caloric_deficit_and_weight_loss | caloric deficit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Weight Loss Speed Scale
The speed of your weight loss can be viewed on a scale, ranging from easier, slower methods to more difficult, rapid ones. All rules from lower levels are included if you opt for a higher-level plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The choice of level depends on your mental state and readiness to make sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Level 1: Minimizing Desserts
To start your weight loss journey, begin by cutting out or minimizing desserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Desserts are problematic due to:
*   **Sugar**: An addictive substance that creates a similar brain reaction to cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Dirty Carbohydrates**: Ingredients like maida (refined flour) are not beneficial for your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **High Fat Content**: Fat is often added for flavor, making desserts delicious and highly addictive when combined with sugar and refined carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Level 2: Eliminating Vegetarian Junk Food
This level involves cutting out sugar and vegetarian junk foods, with the exception of paneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Unlike non-vegetarian junk food, which might offer some protein, vegetarian junk food (such as farsan, pav bhaji, sev puri, pani puri) primarily consists of refined or simple carbohydrates and unhealthy fats, offering minimal protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If you are vegetarian and eat out, paneer-based dishes are a better option as they provide some protein and fat, making them superior to typical vegetarian junk foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Level 3: Making Better Carbohydrate Choices
Beyond sugar and vegetarian junk food, Level 3 focuses on replacing simple (high GI) carbohydrates with complex (low GI) carbohydrates at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Complex Carbs**: Are difficult for the body to digest, keeping you satiated (full) longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Examples include brown rice, oats, whole wheat, and sweet potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Simple Carbs**: Digest quickly, leading to quicker hunger. Examples include white rice, white bread, maida, and potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Replacing simple carbs with complex ones leads to higher energy levels, prolonged satiety, and improved body composition due to lower overall calorie consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Following these first three rules can almost prevent excess weight gain for life, provided cheat meals are managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Level 4: Indian Paleo Diet
This level introduces diet protocols. The Indian Paleo diet is a low-carb approach that avoids all carb sources like rice, potatoes, wheat, and any grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It includes meat, veggies, fruits, and, uniquely for the Indian version, dals (legumes), despite their small carbohydrate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. In this plan, you might have fruit for breakfast and then veggies and protein sources (excluding typical carbohydrates) for the rest of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Level 5: [[challenges_and_alternatives_to_the_keto_diet | Ketogenic Diet]]
The [[challenges_and_alternatives_to_the_keto_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a very low-carb diet where net carbs must be kept under 20 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Your only carb sources are vegetables, and in strict [[challenges_and_alternatives_to_the_keto_diet | keto]], these are limited to green leafy vegetables, excluding higher-carb options like carrots or beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This diet can lead to very rapid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Level 6: [[dietary_guidelines_and_caloric_deficit_strategies_in_intermittent_fasting | Intermittent Fasting]]
If a low-carb diet is not preferred, [[dietary_guidelines_and_caloric_deficit_strategies_in_intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] is another protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Level 7: Combining [[dietary_guidelines_and_caloric_deficit_strategies_in_intermittent_fasting | Intermittent Fasting]] and [[challenges_and_alternatives_to the_keto_diet | Ketogenic Diet]]
To achieve very rapid weight loss, such as 5 kg in one week, combining [[dietary_guidelines_and_caloric_deficit_strategies_in_intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] with a [[challenges_and_alternatives_to_the_keto_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a highly effective, though difficult, protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Both protocols accelerate the rate of weight loss and can be safely combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Level 8: Saltless Diet (Unhealthy, Temporary)
This level is not recommended for general health and is only meant for extreme temporary results, such as for a photoshoot or a specific event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It involves going completely saltless for 1-2 days to shed water weight, often combined with a diuretic pill and potassium supplement, as done before bodybuilding competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This protocol drains the body of water, leading to what is called "paper thin skin" but is a dangerous state of partial dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

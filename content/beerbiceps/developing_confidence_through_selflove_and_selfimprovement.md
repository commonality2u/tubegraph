Money, fame, and success are determined by two primary factors: the ability to work hard and a correct career [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Before entering the "real world," it is crucial to improve every aspect of one's [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The following are three key lessons that can significantly contribute to [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | personal growth]] and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Leveraging Criticism for Growth

People who mock, doubt, or hurt you can actually be catalysts for [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Instead of feeling bad, such negative experiences can be transformed into motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, if someone criticizes your weight, use it as motivation to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. If told you won't succeed, use it as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Your future is solely in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

It is acceptable to feel inferior at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Life is a continuous [[studying_for_selfimprovement | self-improvement]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. One can choose to dwell on negative situations or actively choose to grow in every aspect of life to become the best version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Embracing Flaws and Self-Love

Your perceived flaws are often much smaller than you imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Nobody is perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, and you tend to notice your own imperfections more than others do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. In a world characterized by fakeness and insecurity, it is essential to learn to love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Distinguishing Changeable from Unchangeable Aspects
There are aspects of yourself that cannot be changed, such as your hair, skin color, or nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For these, it is vital to learn to love them, as they contribute to who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

However, there are also changeable aspects, like clothing choices and other external appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As you transition from childhood to adulthood, these changes are part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Improving external confidence can lead to internal confidence, which in turn fosters internal happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Redefining Success Beyond Academic Marks

One of the most significant teenage life lessons is that marks should never define you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While society often suggests that grades determine happiness, academic scores primarily influence only the initial chapters (5 to 10 years) of one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Beyond this initial period, employers and peers will care more about your proficiency in your chosen field, the kind of person you are, and the passion you invest in your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Pressure from parents and teachers often stems from their desire to protect their own reputations or as a form of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Therefore, poor academic performance should not be a source of distress; it is merely a small moment in the timeline of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Your future is not dictated by your marks, but by the "hustle" and effort you put into the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. At every stage, strive to become the best version of yourself and to love every part of who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## A Three-Point Formula for Success

Success in life can be summarized by a three-point formula:
1.  **Love:** Love people and love your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  **Gratitude:** Have gratitude for everything the world has provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
3.  **Positivity:** Focus on happiness and all the positives in your situation, your life, and who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

You are more beautiful than you can ever imagine, but it is up to you to realize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

In the public eye, individuals, especially those in the entertainment industry, often face challenges related to negative energies and intentions from others. This necessitates the adoption of [[spiritual_practices_for_protection_against_negative_entities | spiritual practices]] for self-protection and maintaining one's well-being.

## The Concept of Nazar (Evil Eye)
Nazar, often understood as the "evil eye," is believed to be a significant threat to those in the public eye due to the sheer number of people constantly observing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. It is described as an energy stemming from envy, hate, and jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
The impact of Nazar can manifest in various ways:
*   Physical pain and sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.
*   Mental disturbance, sleep loss, depression, and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. Many stars struggle with depression and anxiety because of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   A dimming or "killing" of one's aura, affecting their appearance and appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.
*   Negative impacts on career, personal life, and relationships, causing things to "crumble down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

Nazar can be transmitted not only through direct interaction but also digitally, as eyes are considered the "gate of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

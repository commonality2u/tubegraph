## Parental Perspectives on Career Choices

Ashish's journey from a background in business to a career in acting highlights the family's flexible and supportive stance on [[parental_perspectives_on_pursuing_unconventional_careers | unconventional careers]].

### Ashish's Early Work Ethic and Business Acumen
Ashish's father, who is from the business world, notes that Ashish started working with him from the age of 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This early exposure to work, unlike many "sheltered" rich kids, helped shape his personality and instilled in him the understanding that success is more important than money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Even while pursuing his studies at Datta Meghe College, Ashish regularly worked in multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. He was instrumental in introducing high technology like 3D and 7.1 Dolby sound to the multiplexes, showing a passion for Hollywood movies and the cinematic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. He also handled daily banking tasks, demonstrating a consistent work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. His father states that Ashish was effectively earning from a young age through his contributions, comparable to an assistant's salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Transition to Acting and Parental Support
Ashish initially started his video channel as a passion project, driven by his long-standing desire to act, rather than an immediate goal to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

His mother initially had reservations when Ashish started making videos, questioning what he was doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. However, after he showed her his work, she became supportive and expressed happiness at his efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. She provided him with whatever he needed for his work at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> and even gave feedback on his content, advising him when she felt the public might get bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This active involvement showcases her support for his [[acting_career_challenges | acting career challenges]].

When Ashish decided he couldn't continue with engineering and wanted to be an actor, his father agreed, suggesting he pursue both his studies and his passion simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The emphasis was on completing his studies and not leaving midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, demonstrating a belief that while passion is important, education also holds significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This reflects the family's approach to [[balancing_college_and_youtube_career | balancing college and YouTube career]].

## Values Instilled by Parents

The Chanchlani family prioritizes several core values that they believe are crucial for enduring success:

*   **Humility and Kindness:** Both Ashish and Muskan are described as "very humble" and "very good," considering humility their biggest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They treat everyone, including household staff, with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Their parents have instilled in them the belief that true success lies in remaining humble even after achieving fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **No Jealousy:** The children do not feel jealous of others' success, instead feeling positive about the hard work of their peers, like Amit Bhadana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Obsession and Hard Work:** The family acknowledges that obsession with one's work, especially when starting a career, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Ashish's immersion in his craft, even speaking dialogues in his sleep, exemplifies this dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Success Over Money:** Ashish's father highlights that he taught Ashish from childhood that success is more important than money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He uses the example of film stars like Aamir Khan, whose fame fluctuated with the success of their films, to emphasize that true success and the hunger for it keeps one humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This focus helps them navigate [[managing_fame_and_family_reactions | managing fame and family reactions]].
*   **Creating One's Own Identity:** Ashish learned from his father's example to forge his own path, rather than relying on inherited wealth or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. He never wanted to "flaunt" his family's money but instead desired to be independent and build his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

Colonel Rajeev Bharwan, identified as representing the Airborne forces, has served in various military capacities both within and outside India, accumulating extensive combat experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. His professional life has been largely defined by his involvement in action, particularly in [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies | combat operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:18">[04:15:18]</a>. He considers himself best suited for combat and second-best at training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>.

## Combat Operations Overview
Colonel Bharwan's service has predominantly involved counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:25">[04:23:25]</a>. He estimates having been in "more than 100" [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies | combat situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:52">[05:50:52]</a>. Many of these operations were "fighting in built-up areas" (FIBUA), which is considered one of the most difficult types of operations in military terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:52">[06:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:18">[06:16:18]</a>. This difficulty arises because every building or house has a different layout, making it unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:23">[06:22:23]</a>.

## Regional Experiences

### Northeast India
Colonel Bharwan's first-hand [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies | combat experience]] began in 1999, the year he joined his unit in Kargil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>. However, the "raw" experience of combat was in Manipur, his first posting on deputation to the Assam Rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:24">[07:23:24]</a>.

At the time, Manipur faced an "unparalleled government" run by various groups, and Hindi movies, books, and newspapers were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:45">[08:43:45]</a>. The animosity stemmed from a lack of awareness and exploitation by anti-national elements and groups with political interests, where young people picked up weapons for a sense of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:52">[09:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:50">[09:44:50]</a>.

#### First Dangerous Encounter
One early combat experience in Northeast India involved entering a house during a FIBUA operation, where he unexpectedly found someone pointing a weapon at his head as he opened the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:01">[10:42:01]</a>. The weapon malfunctioned, giving him the critical seconds needed to react and neutralize the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:02">[12:11:02]</a>. He describes going "black" for a moment due to the shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

#### Lessons from Manipur
From his time in Manipur, Colonel Bharwan derived three key lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>:
1.  **Military Perspective (Assam Rifles)**: He realized the Assam Rifles, known as the "Sentinel of the Northeast," are a highly potent force, a "mini India" with soldiers from all regions speaking multiple languages, including Gorali and Nepali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Their experience, with personnel serving up to 60 years of age, provided invaluable advice in [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies | combat situations]], to the extent that he rarely needed maps or GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Militant Groups' Code of Conduct**: Surprisingly, the militant groups in Manipur had a strong ethical and moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. They would publicly apologize and constitute courts of inquiry for any wrongdoings by their members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. They never harmed women, children, or the elderly, and military personnel with their families were considered "walking insurance policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Public Relations**: Treating the local population with respect (age, gender, children, elderly) ensured safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Colonel Bharwan even attended local marriage functions in remote areas at night without a weapon, relying solely on trust, which proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. He concludes that "situation in an area is as good or bad as you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>.

### Jammu & Kashmir
Regarding Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Colonel Bharwan advises against forming opinions based on media or documentaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. He suggests visiting as a tourist, especially with family, to truly understand the situation and the constant presence of security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

He recounts seeing signs that stated "Indian army and dogs are not allowed" in Srinagar, which was deeply infuriating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. He also witnessed incidents where routes were blocked while moving a fallen soldier's body to the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. He highlights the positive change with the presence of the "Teranga" (Indian flag) at Lal Chowk and the neutralization of agencies causing havoc, believing the environment is getting "cleaned up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

### Africa (Sudan/Abyei)
Colonel Bharwan was deployed to Sudan as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force, specifically in Abyei, a location he describes as one of the worst places in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:00">[51:17:00]</a>. The region was characterized by absolute barrenness, political instability, and extreme scarcity of resources like water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>. He witnessed people drinking cow's blood for thirst and eating boot polish or expired medicines from garbage disposal areas due to hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>. Life had "absolutely no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:00">[51:48:00]</a>.

#### Hostage Situation and Negotiation
He recounts a [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | challenging situation]] where previous military contingents had officers and men taken hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:11:00">[54:11:00]</a>. Tasked with resolving this, he decided to approach a local "warlord" or militant leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Despite the intimidating presence of hundreds of armed men firing into the air, he chose to de-escalate by putting away weapons and approaching with a smile, showing confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:47:00">[56:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>. He directly engaged the leader, who fortunately spoke English, and convinced him to disperse his men to create a suitable environment for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:31:00">[58:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>. The situation was resolved without a single bullet fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>.

#### Unimaginable Barbarity and Humanity
Colonel Bharwan describes witnessing extreme barbarity, including people chopping off heads and playing football with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. He also recounts defying orders to open gates and provide shelter to fleeing civilians, including a pregnant lady, a small child, an old lady, and a man with an amputated leg, during intense firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. He deliberately disobeyed orders to not give water or food to anyone, quietly sharing his own supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. This experience, dating back to 2007-2008, deeply affected him, highlighting the difference between challenges in operations and the suffering of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. He used photographs from Sudan to teach privileged students about the importance of not wasting food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

## Combat-Related Aspects

### Weapons and Equipment
Colonel Bharwan discusses various weapons:
*   **Grenades**: He considers them "useless" and "literally useless," citing their unreliability in his experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Their "killing zone" is roughly 2-3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL)**: This is a highly effective and precise weapon for bunker clearance or hitting targets from long distances (800-900m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Pistols**: Preferred in "fighting in built-up areas" with small rooms due to their swiftness, though they have less accuracy due to recoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **AK-47/56**: Preferred for more open areas, offering greater stability than a pistol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that while other militaries might have different weapons, the [[Indian Special Forces selection and training process | Indian Army]] itself is the "biggest brand" and its soldiers are "the only potent and capable soldiers who can actually fight a battle and are just surviving on water, jaggery and muana (nothing)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. He highlights the unparalleled mental and physical endurance of [[Life and training in the Indian Army | Indian soldiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

### Airborne Forces
Airborne forces operate "from the air," possessing unparalleled reach and penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Every individual in an Airborne unit is capable of exiting an aircraft at high speeds (600 km/h) with full gear, and performing static line or military free-fall jumps in any terrain – jungles, urban areas, high altitudes, or snow-covered peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

There is a significant [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | casualty rate]] associated with Airborne jumps due to unpredictable landing zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. He cites an instance during a night jump where the static line cable broke for three soldiers, causing their parachutes not to deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. They impacted the ground in the trained "para position" and succumbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. To counter the "fear factor" and maintain morale, the remaining soldiers were immediately given new parachutes and jumped again the same night, before the bodies were even moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Night jumps, despite the challenges of visibility and quick reaction time, are found "more exotic" and "beautiful" by Colonel Bharwan, offering a clear, silent aerial view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### Survival Training and Food
As part of [[Life and training in the Indian Army | Commando training]], soldiers are expected to eat "anything that walks, crawls, creeps, or flies" when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Colonel Bharwan has eaten snake (raw and cooked) and crocodile, considering crocodile meat better than chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. He has also eaten insects and snails, finding snails the "worst thing" due to their creepy feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This training also involves drinking muddy or "shitty" water by filtering it through organic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Philosophy and Outlook
Colonel Bharwan asserts that the [[the_spiritual_and_psychological_aspects_of_military_life | biggest brand]] and the best brand in the world is the [[Life and training in the Indian Army | Indian Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. He emphasizes that being a soldier is "by heart, not by uniform," highlighting that attitude and dedication to the nation matter more than military attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. He encourages aspiring defense personnel not to lose heart if they cannot join the forces, as they can still contribute to the nation as citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. He states that he carries only positive memories and lessons from his [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>.

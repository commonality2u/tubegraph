A [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | hair care routine]] is one of the most important aspects of [[basic_male_grooming_tips_for_indian_men | men's grooming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Regardless of location or genetics, hair will eventually start thinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to learn how to care for both hair and scalp while young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This routine focuses on hair health, proper washing, oiling, and [[post_shower_hair_care_tips_including_serums_and_combing | post-wash treatments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Oiling Your Hair

Oiling hair is considered a significant contribution from India to [[basic_male_grooming_tips_for_indian_men | men's grooming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It should be done at least two or three times a week to nourish the hair effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Application Tips and Benefits
*   **Heating the Oil**: Heating the oil before application helps open the scalp's pores, allowing the oil to seep in and nourish both the scalp and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Nourishment Benefits**: Oiling prevents bacterial and fungal infections, strengthens hair, promotes better hair growth, and helps maintain hair thickness for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Frequency Adjustment**: While two to three times a week is generally recommended, individuals with naturally oily skin or hair may only need to oil once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Oiling**: Excessive oiling can clog hair pores, increasing the risk of [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]] and potential infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Application Method**: Heat the oil until warm, then apply it to the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Mixing oils like amla and coconut oil can provide mixed nourishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Soaking Time**: Ideally, oil should stay in the hair overnight for at least 12 hours for maximum absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, even one hour with heated oil can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Alternative Products**: Hot oil products that create an exothermic reaction upon rubbing can be used to open pores and nourish the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Scalp Massage**: Massaging the scalp in a circular motion increases blood circulation, aiding in the removal of dead skin cells and the formation of new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Shampooing Techniques

Given the hot climate and genetic predisposition to oily scalps among Indian men, [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]] is a common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Choosing and Using Shampoos
*   **Anti-Dandruff Shampoo**: An anti-dandruff shampoo (e.g., Head & Shoulders, Clinic All Clear, Seba Med) is a top priority for hair washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. These strong shampoos should only be used once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Overusing them can spoil hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Mild Shampoos**: For daily or alternate-day use (two to three times a week), a milder shampoo should be used to maintain hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. These are often labeled for specific hair concerns like "silky hair" or "unmanageable hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Choose one that addresses your specific hair issues, such as frizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Pillowcase Cleanliness**: Unmanaged [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]] can persist due to contaminated pillowcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Regularly washing pillowcases and bed sheets is crucial to prevent continuous infection of the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Shampoo Function**: Shampoos are water-based products designed to wash the hair and scalp, removing excess dirt and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Conditioning Hair

Conditioners are oil-based products that play a vital role in a comprehensive [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | hair care routine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Conditioner Usage
*   **Frequency**: Conditioners should not be overused due to their oil-based nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For those with oily genetics, using conditioner once or twice a week is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Individuals with dry hair or skin may use it more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Pairing Products**: It is advisable to use a conditioner that is the "sister product" to your shampoo, as these pairs often work best together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Protocol**: The specific protocol for shampoo and conditioner use may vary based on individual genetics, but generally, oily hair benefits from less frequent conditioning, while dry hair benefits from more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Anti-[[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]] shampoos should always be kept to a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## [[post_shower_hair_care_tips_including_serums_and_combing | Post-Shower Hair Care]]

After showering, [[post_shower_hair_care_tips_including_serums_and_combing | post-shower hair care]] is simple, involving primarily a hair serum and a comb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Drying, Combing, and Serum Application
*   **Towel Drying**: Hair should be dabbed dry with a towel, not ruffled, to avoid damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Combing**: Combing hair along its natural direction of growth, ensuring the comb makes contact with the scalp, helps increase blood circulation to the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, for rough hair, using hands to shape the hair might be preferable as combs can sometimes make it look worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Hair Serum**: Serum primarily enhances the look of hair, making it appear thicker, glossier, and shinier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It also provides a protective coating against excess humidity and dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Serum Application**: Apply a coin-sized amount of serum to the hands, rub it, and then apply it to the body of the hair (not the scalp) while it is still slightly wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

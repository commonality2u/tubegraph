While accessories can include items like flares and wristbands, classic dressing emphasizes timeless pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The Importance of Watches
Watches are seen as a classic way to demonstrate sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They suggest that the wearer is a busy individual who values time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   A professional-looking watch, such as a neutral silver watch with a blue dial, can be worn for work or a date and pairs well with various outfits, including blue ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Films like *Border* have had a profound cultural impact in India, particularly concerning public perception and inspiration related to the Indian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

## Cultural and Inspirational Impact
*Border* is considered a culturally impactful film, alongside others like *LOC Kargil* and *Hera Pheri* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. A whole generation of Indians, and even the [[Indian Armys exposure and global perception | Indian military]] itself, drew inspiration from *Border* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. The film is credited with inspiring younger individuals to join the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Witnessing scenes like Sunil Shetty running into a battlefield in the film evokes a desire to be a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

The film's energy was deeply connected to the armed forces and the concept of uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>, honoring the numerous people who had sacrificed their lives for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Its enduring impact means that while other things might be forgotten, *Border* will ensure that the sacrifices it depicts are remembered across generations, particularly on Republic Day and Independence Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>.

## Production Insights
During the making of *Border*, the team realized it would become an important film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Director J.P. Dutta was deeply "in love with the [[Life in the Indian Army | Indian forces]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a> and chose to make films based on his beliefs rather than commercial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. The set of *Border* often saw cast and crew in tears when the song "Sandeshe Aate Hain" was played, highlighting the emotional depth of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

## Military Perspective on Films
While many in the military are grateful for films like *Border* and *LOC Kargil* for inspiring younger kids to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>, some are critical of the specific details, noting that they are not always an exact representation of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. Nevertheless, these films are widely considered beneficial for the military's public image and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

There is a call for more films about the forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. The Indian government and Army are now actively encouraging filmmakers, offering infrastructure and technical expertise to projects they believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. This support extends to other forces like the police, who also deserve recognition for their 20-hour workdays in ensuring safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

## Social Media and Public Perception
The current era of social media has both positive and negative impacts. While it fosters a lack of privacy and can destroy lives through edited sentences and abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, it has also played a role in making people respect entities like the military and pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. This "human side" of social media helps convey what truly matters to people, like honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. There is a growing trend among the current generation to celebrate the military more, partly due to increased discussions on platforms like podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

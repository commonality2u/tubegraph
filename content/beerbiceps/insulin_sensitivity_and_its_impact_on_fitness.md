Insulin sensitivity is a key factor in improving your metabolism, gaining lean muscle, and rapidly burning fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It plays a significant role in your overall fitness levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:07">[05:50:07]</a>.

## What is Insulin Sensitivity?

While [[intermittent_fasting_benefits | intermittent fasting]] (IF) does not change the amount of insulin secreted by the body, it directly impacts your body's *insulin sensitivity* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:49">[05:29:49]</a>. Insulin, alongside human growth hormone (HGH), is an anabolic hormone that aids in increasing muscle mass and burning fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:04">[05:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:08">[05:46:08]</a>.

To illustrate, consider two individuals:
*   **Person A (more insulin sensitive)**: Requires 10ml of insulin to gain 10 grams of muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:07">[05:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   **Person B (less insulin sensitive)**: Needs 20ml of insulin to achieve the same 10-gram muscle gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

Being less insulin sensitive means your body requires more insulin to create the same physiological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Therefore, a body with higher insulin sensitivity operates more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

## How Intermittent Fasting Impacts Insulin Sensitivity

Generally, younger individuals tend to be more insulin sensitive, with sensitivity decreasing as one ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. However, [[intermittent_fasting_benefits | intermittent fasting]] can significantly improve your insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. By adopting the IF diet, you can enhance your body's ability to burn fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Improved Insulin Sensitivity

Both [[the_role_of_human_growth_hormone_hgh_in_fasting | HGH]] and insulin work in tandem to improve your body's *nutrient repartitioning* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This means your body becomes more efficient at utilizing the food you consume to build muscle mass rather than storing it as fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. This contributes to a better body composition, including a lower fat percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

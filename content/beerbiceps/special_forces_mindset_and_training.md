The discussion about Special Forces often begins with Major Vivek Jacob, a highly respected Special Forces veteran described as one of India's fiercest and most battle-hardened soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This conversation aims to offer a deep dive into his mind and heart, exploring the unique [[mindset_and_training_of_special_forces_soldiers | perspectives]] gained through his [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Defining Special Forces

The [[structure_and_selection_process_of_the_indian_special_forces | Special Forces]] are described as the highest efficiency troop within the [[the_role_of_indian_army_special_forces | Indian Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:08">[06:35:08]</a>. These soldiers are considered psychologically and physically a cut above the rest due to their supplementary training and the types of missions they undertake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

Major Jacob emphasizes that Special Forces represent a mindset that develops over time through various emotional, psychological, and physical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. It's about realizing that everyone is uniquely special, a realization that forms a neural network over time as experiences shape an individual's understanding of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. In the military context, Special Forces are a "directed energy" used by the government and Armed Forces for national security, to resolve issues, and ensure the country is a safer place for its citizens to live freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

Their mandate is open-ended; they can be tasked to do "anything, anywhere, anytime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. This often involves creative destruction, destroying but within specific parameters unique to each operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Combat and Chaos

[[combat_experience_and_mentality | Combat scenarios]] are intense, with real stakes of life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Major Jacob recounts a situation where a young soldier's bulletproof collapsed, cracking his skull and causing his eye to pop out, yet he still managed to eliminate the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This highlights the extreme circumstances soldiers face.

### Navigating Extreme Challenges
Major Jacob describes a particularly challenging operation early in his career where, for the first time, he felt an overwhelming instinct to extract from the situation, despite nothing having physically gone wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This discomfort escalated into extreme anxiety, which he initially attributed to laziness and a desire for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. However, he decided to stay, and shortly after, his teammate stepped on a mine, losing his leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

In such moments of chaos, the difference between life and death depends on how one handles the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The [[leadership_and_responsibility_in_intense_combat_situations | immediate choices]] involve assessing the wound, stemming blood flow, applying bandages, and extending the time the injured person is alive until extraction and surgery are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### The Role of Flow State
To cope with such intense situations, Special Forces soldiers enter a "Flow State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This involves surrendering to the situation, which leads to acceptance, then awareness, and finally the ability to make critical choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. In a flow state, there is no past or future, only the present moment and the actions that need to be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

> "You have to go into Flow State, you have to surrender to the situation. You have by surrendering comes acceptance. Once acceptance comes from acceptance comes awareness, with awareness there comes choices, from choices you can make that one choice that is going to make the difference between your brother living or dying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>

### Preparing for "F***-ups"
[[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | Special Forces training]] also involves preparing for "f***-ups," which in a military environment typically means a teammate getting shot, maimed, or dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. When such a situation occurs, it signifies ultimate chaos where anything can happen and everything is out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The ability to maintain awareness and focus on opportunities determines [[survival_strategies_in_military_operations | survival]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Spiritual and Philosophical Aspects

Major Jacob discusses how the extreme experiences of [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat]] transform a person's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. The constant proximity to life and death creates a barrier that soldiers cross, letting go of fear of loss of life or limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Beyond Duality and Ego
In combat, soldiers must let go of duality (life/death, past/future) and completely focus on the "now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This surrender opens up the spiritual aspect of one's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Major Jacob suggests that the mind is a limitation, and by "losing that 'I'" – the egoic self-definition – the "real you" starts to open up, connecting to a higher "Source," "Spirit," or "Supreme Consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### Intuition and the Sixth Sense
Through prolonged [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat exposure]], many Special Forces soldiers develop a heightened intuition or "sixth sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This allows them to "know" that something is going to happen before it actually does, even hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This expanded awareness, beyond the five senses, enables them to perceive information that hasn't materialized yet in the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Near-Death Experiences
Major Jacob describes a near-death experience where he was caught in an impossible situation on a cliff, facing an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. In that moment, he experienced a "life flash," seeing his entire life as a detached, emotionless observation of episodes, without judgment, regret, or guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This phenomenon, which he relates to a burst of DMT in the brain, shows the mind operating beyond linear time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He survived the encounter, an outcome he considers impossible, suggesting an alternative form of reality at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Nature and Animals

Special Forces personnel often operate in raw nature, far from civilization, leading to a unique connection with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Major Jacob recounts an instance where he found a leopard sitting peacefully next to him while on Sentry duty, both looking in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Animals can sense fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, and Special Forces soldiers, by shedding thoughts and operating on instinct, align with nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Another encounter involved two large bears in a high-altitude mountain region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Despite the bears charging and roaring, they did not attack, sensing no fear from the soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This is partly attributed to the soldiers' natural scent from prolonged periods in the wild without bathing, making them a "familiar smell to the animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Ultimate Purpose

The experiences of Special Forces soldiers, particularly those in active [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat]], lead to profound reflections and realizations about life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Major Jacob believes that everyone possesses a "god" inside them, a supreme consciousness and ability that can be realized by overcoming the limitations of the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This realization, or "unleashing of one's own self," allows individuals to become more open human beings and spread love, joy, and peace in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Paranormal investigator Sarabjit Mohanty discusses his experiences and insights into the world of spirits and demons in India, highlighting various case studies and debunking common misconceptions. This second part of a horror special podcast delves into the complexities of paranormal phenomena, the impact of popular culture, and the scientific aspects of investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

## Notable Investigations and Haunted Locations

India is home to numerous locations reported to be haunted, with spirits often unaware of their deceased state or trapped for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:09">[06:09:09]</a>.

### Kandala Graveyard
During an investigation at a graveyard in Kandala where German prisoners of war were buried, Mohanty and his team encountered a soldier from the 1800s who had no idea it was the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

### Hulker Bridge, Pune
Considered one of India's most haunted locations, Hulker Bridge in Pune revealed a spirit named Mr. Shinas, who had been stuck there since the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. Through devices, it was understood that Shinas was a scholar who was mummified, placed in a box-like structure, and thrown alive into a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. The team's attempt to help him "find light" seemingly resulted in his release, as no further replies were received after their prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:58">[02:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.

### Abandoned Church in Nainital
In Nainital, an abandoned church adjacent to a former hospital was investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. The hospital's British-era doctor reportedly healed people but later started predicting their deaths, isolating them in a "moksha" room before killing them to experiment on the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The church, though in ruins, still contained entities, some of whom were "scared" of other demonic entities outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

### Bombay (Mumbai) COVID-era Case
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a 15-year-old girl in Bombay was believed to be demonically possessed, exhibiting violent behavior like throwing parents and biting her psychologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Upon investigation, no paranormal activity was detected; the girl confessed her actions were a way to avoid 10th board exams and school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. This behavior, termed "excited delirium," demonstrates how psychological factors can mimic possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Understanding Spirits and Hauntings

According to paranormal investigators, a place is "haunted" when spirits or energies frequently visit or reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Every place, in some way, is haunted, but the difference lies in the activity level of the spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Types of Spirits
*   **Good Spirits**: These spirits do not seek attention and are present to help, often aiding in endeavors like work or business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Stuck Spirits**: Many spirits, approximately 8 out of 10 cases, are unaware they are dead and remain in a loop of their day-to-day activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. They seek attention because they don't understand their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Voluntarily Lingering Spirits**: Some spirits know they are dead and can cross over but choose to stay for various reasons, including revenge or helping family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.
    *   Bollywood's portrayal of spirits returning for revenge is considered true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   The "hell" for a stuck spirit is being unable to be acknowledged by loved ones or being confined to a limited area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Spirits Fearing Judgment Day**: Due to religious teachings about hell and judgment, some spirits, aware of their past sins, fear crossing over and thus remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This is why prisons are often haunted by criminals who fear what awaits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

### Misconceptions and Influences on Beliefs

The perception of the paranormal, particularly in India, is heavily influenced by media portrayals.
[[impact_of_movies_on_paranormal_beliefs | Impact of movies on paranormal beliefs]]
*   **White Sari Concept**: Indian horror movies popularized the image of female ghosts in white saris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This stems from an ancient belief that a pure soul, leaving the body after death, is white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This cinematic trope leads many people to misinterpret normal experiences as paranormal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated Damage**: Movies often incorrectly depict the extent of physical damage entities can inflict on bodies or environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While films like *The Conjuring* are closer to reality, they still take creative liberties for dramatic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Tools and Methodology in Paranormal Investigations
[[the_science_and_methodology_of_paranormal_investigations | The Science and Methodology of Paranormal Investigations]]

Paranormal investigators use specialized tools to detect and communicate with entities.
*   **PSB7 Device**: This device scans radio frequencies and is used to communicate with spirits in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. By controlling the speed and direction of scanning (e.g., reversing the scan), investigators can distinguish genuine spirit voices from random radio broadcasts, preventing misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **White Noise**: Spirits communicate through white noise, which contains all frequencies, allowing for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.
*   **EMF Devices**: Electromagnetic field (EMF) devices measure energy fluctuations caused by the interaction of spirit energies with the environment's existing energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Spirits absorb EMF from electrical appliances, cameras, and mobile phone batteries to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.
*   **ESTES Experiment**: This experiment involves having a subject wear noise-cancelling headphones connected to the PSB7 device and being blindfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. This blocks the sense of sight, enhancing other senses and allowing the subject to "hear" voices and sounds from the spiritual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

## Demonology and Possessions
[[paranormal_theories_and_entities_in_indian_culture | Paranormal theories and entities in Indian culture]]

Demonology is the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Inhuman Spirits**: Demons are considered "inhuman spirits" that have never walked the Earth or taken physical birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. They are much more powerful than human spirits and can cause greater emotional and physical damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **Misdiagnosis**: Many cases initially reported as demonic possessions are later found to be either psychological issues or powerful human spirits mimicking demonic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Psychological Evaluation**: Before investigating a purported demonic possession, a medical evaluation (psychiatrist, psychologist, MRI) is crucial, as many "possessions" are simply psychological effects or mental illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The human mind can project significant energy, leading to "excited delirium," where individuals exhibit superhuman strength or aggressive behavior, which can be mistaken for possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Origin of Demons**: The concept of demons largely originates from religious texts across various faiths (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. These figures were, in part, created to instill fear, thereby strengthening faith in God and the "light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

### Serial Killers and Demonology
*   **Jeffrey Dahmer**: A serial killer who mainly targeted the LGBT community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. Mohanty believes individuals who commit such acts cannot be human beings and have lost their soul's humanity, effectively becoming modern-world demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   **Son of Sam**: David Berkowitz, known as Son of Sam, targeted females and claimed his neighbor's pet dog, whom he believed was Lucifer, commanded him to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Michael Taylor Case (1974)**: Michael Taylor, a man who brutally murdered his wife after an exorcism, presents a complex case with multiple angles:
    *   **Schizophrenia**: Taylor could have been schizophrenic, and the exorcism rituals may have worsened his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
    *   **Serial Killer**: Taylor showed signs of being a serial killer from the beginning, such as an inability to hold a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   **Actual Possession**: The third possibility is that he was genuinely possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **Anneliese Michel (The Exorcism of Emily Rose)**: The famous case of Anneliese Michel, depicted in *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*, where she died during an exorcism, was later found to be a case of manslaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Her parents and the priest were charged because they failed to consider her potential psychological illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.

## Positive Energies and Spiritual Growth

Beyond malevolent entities, the spiritual world also encompasses powerful positive energies.
[[role_of_paranormal_investigators_and_varying_beliefs | Role of paranormal investigators and varying beliefs]]
*   **EMF in Sacred Places**: Temples, churches, mosques, and dargahs, even abandoned ones, radiate strong EMF fields due to the collective prayers and energy of devotees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. This energy contributes to the feelings of peace and satisfaction experienced in these places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Human Energy and Chi**: The human body itself has electricity and energy (neurons, nervous system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Practices like Reiki and Tai Chi demonstrate the ability to manipulate and project this energy, referred to as "Chi" or "Prana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. Collective prayer, in particular, can accumulate significant energy in a space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Mata Ana Phenomena**: This phenomenon refers to positive deity possession, where an individual, open to possession, channels a divine power to answer questions or deliver messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>. While genuine instances exist, some individuals, especially women in male-dominated rural areas, might feign possession to gain attention and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Crystals**: Crystals are believed to be powerful tools from nature that can heal, protect, and shield against negative spirits and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. They absorb negativity and need to be charged (e.g., with moonlight or sunlight) to remain effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
*   **Meditation**: Meditation is a crucial practice for strengthening and protecting one's mind and soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Through meditation, individuals can understand the reality of both positive and negative spiritual aspects and learn to tap into their inner strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The world of paranormal investigations is complex, often blurring the lines between genuine spiritual encounters and psychological phenomena. While there are genuine cases of spirits and energies, the field is often marred by fakes, leading to skepticism within the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Ultimately, understanding the paranormal requires an open mind and recognizing the power of the human spirit and mind, which, through practices like meditation, can be cultivated for protection and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.

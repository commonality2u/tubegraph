Suniel Shetty is known for his acting career, but he also has a flourishing business career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The mindset behind his success, particularly the "masculine lessons," is a focus of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He has been relooking and reinventing himself, returning to work after an eight-year gap with the intention of enjoying and making his work meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He views this return as a "launch as a senior citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Evolution in Appearance and Industry

Shetty notes that he is perceived as looking "sexier" as he ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He attributes this to focusing on health and wellness, which has been a consistent factor in his life regardless of career success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. He believes his timing was right for aging, as there is now more knowledge about skin wellness, gut health, and traditional practices like yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He states that he looks even better now than during his earlier phase in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Career Beginnings and Challenges

Shetty entered the film industry around age 28 or 29, after getting an opportunity due to his martial arts background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. His first film, *Balwaan*, was a huge success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. However, he was initially criticized as "wooden" and advised to return to his family's Udupi restaurant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. He was not embarrassed by his background, stating that he cleaned tables because his father did so from the age of nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. He admits he never attended acting school and his Hindi was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

During this period of early criticism, he realized he needed to return to the "drawing board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. To maintain his self-respect, he pursued his entrepreneurial side, which gave him confidence beyond his acting struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. He wanted to retire from acting and be known for his background from a humble, simple family where "work meant worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. He came from the hospitality business, where the customer was always right, and positive word-of-mouth was crucial for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

In his 20s, he wished he had more "brains" and was less naive and innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. In his 30s, he wished he had "knowledge of acting" as he got into the profession without formal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. He developed his "action hero" persona by performing "death-defying stunts" to compensate for being perceived as a "bad actor" and avoid being dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. This garnered him a large fan following, which led to more films and allowed him to learn acting through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

## Views on the Hindi Film Industry and Fame

### Social Media's Impact
Shetty highlights social media as the worst aspect of modern society due to its destruction of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. A single sentence can be edited and spread in many ways, making life difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He is "scared to talk" because of how things can be manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He feels actors are forced to be diplomatic, facing abuse from unknown individuals on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, which can target their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. He finds it hurtful when his family is insulted for things he hasn't done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### Adulation vs. Criticism
Despite the challenges, he acknowledges the "lot of adulation, lot of love" in the Hindi film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. He doesn't get bothered by mimicry or caricatures, as those who do so often disappear within a few months lacking their own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. He views critics who ran him down as having gotten their "answer" due to his enduring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Financial Aspects
Shetty notes a significant difference in remuneration between past and present heroes, with current actors earning substantially more per film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. However, he states that money has "never bothered" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>, and he often wasn't fully paid for many of his 130 films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

### Cultural Relevance
He considers the film *Border* to be defining for his career, as playing a real-life hero is very tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. He feels blessed to have remained culturally relevant, citing the success of his recent action film *Hunter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. He attributes this continued relevance to production houses and distribution platforms like Sama and Amazon mini TV who believe in him as an action hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. He is also excited about an upcoming *Hera Pheri* film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, returning to the comedy genre.

## Personal Philosophy on Career and Life

Suniel Shetty believes that success should not go to one's head and failure should not affect one's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. He views his recent career phase as a "new innings," where he is more conscious and intends to take others along with him who are less fortunate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. He feels fortunate to have a second innings and wants to give back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>.

He reflects on past mistakes, such as choosing the wrong subjects and believing that stardom would carry him through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of giving time and attention to one's work, treating it like one's own child, as taught by his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. During the pandemic, he prioritized his employees, aiming to add more people rather than offloading them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. This approach, he believes, contributes to his continued blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>.

He attributes his grounded mindset and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong to his martial arts background, specifically the Yava Gojri style of martial arts under Sensei P.S. Mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of having a "guru" rather than just trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

Eight-time Mr. Olympia winner Ronnie Coleman shares his insights on the demanding world of bodybuilding, emphasizing the crucial roles of rigorous training, disciplined nutrition, and a resilient mindset. He asserts that bodybuilding is "probably the hardest sport in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## The Demands of Bodybuilding

Coleman describes bodybuilding as a 24/7, 365-day commitment, where "you can't really slip up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> because competitors are constantly working just as hard to take the title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The lifestyle demands significant [[bodybuilding_challenges_and_rewards | sacrifices]], leading to "real real dark times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. During his competitive years, he couldn't go out to eat, to movies, to parties, or even hang out with friends; "everything was about bodybuilding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Coleman also notes that despite winning eight Mr. Olympia titles, he doesn't feel it was "rewarding at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, especially considering the extreme measures required, such as the food intake and "all the shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. He only started to truly enjoy his accomplishments after his career ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Ronnie Coleman's Approach to Training

Coleman's success was built on several key principles:

### Heavy Lifting and Powerlifting Roots
Coleman's "tactical edge" was his commitment to training even harder after winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. He performed feats of strength that other bodybuilders wouldn't or couldn't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, such as:
*   Squatting 800 lbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>
*   Deadlifting 800 lbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Leg pressing 2300 lbs for nine reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>
*   Bench pressing 500 lbs for reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>

He credits his powerlifting background, which began at 14-15 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, for his ability to handle such heavy weights. He also believes that lifting heavier weights is "the more effective way to gain size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, definition, and thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, which gave him a unique "density" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a> that stood out.

### The Mental Edge and Visualization
Coleman emphasizes that [[role_of_genetics_and_mentality_in_bodybuilding | mentality is a huge part of bodybuilding success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. His key mental attributes included being:
*   Determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
*   Focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
*   Motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
*   Dedicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
*   Perseverant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Having strong faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>

He often visualized his lifts, stating, "most the time I had already done it before I did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. For example, he pictured himself squatting 800 lbs for two weeks leading up to the actual lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Rep Ranges and Training Consistency
Coleman consistently followed a fixed rep range for his bodybuilding workouts: 20, 15, 12, and 10 reps for four sets, taking each set to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. While he did lower reps (3-6) during his powerlifting days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>, he never used them for bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. He also did 100-rep sets occasionally, but only "just for fun" and not for bodybuilding gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of consistency in training, regardless of specific exercise variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

## Dietary Strategies for Size

Coleman describes a crucial realization he had after winning his first Olympia: "the only way to get big is eat Foods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. He initially thought lifting heavy weights was enough, but learned he "had to eat so much food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

His winning diet involved:
*   Six meals a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   A pound of chicken in every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Eating in the middle of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, even if not hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   Stuffing himself with food, gradually increasing intake from 10 ounces to 16 ounces per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   Consuming 600 grams of protein daily during his peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

Coleman attributes his "thickness" to the inclusion of red meat in his diet, though he ate it only once a day, with most meals being chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. He believes it's possible to build a physique with just chicken and fish, but "you probably can't look like I did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a> without red meat. He also notes a "significant amount of size and strength" is lost when one leaves meat from their [[dangers_and_benefits_of_various_diet_protocols | diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>, stressing the [[importance_of_high_protein_intake_for_muscle_recovery | role of protein]] in building muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

His mother cooked all six of his daily meals throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, providing essential family support. Even now, he maintains a high protein intake of 200-300 grams daily to support his size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. He prefers bland food and avoids spicy Indian cuisine, which his system cannot tolerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Supplementation and Steroids

Coleman openly discusses his steroid use, emphasizing that everything he took was "doctor prescribed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. He underwent health checkups every four months to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were functioning correctly, and "never had a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. He stresses the critical need for medical guidance when using steroids, recommending checkups at least every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

He began using steroids at age 30, after consulting with Flex Wheeler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. He clarified that he took "normal dosage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a> and that massive amounts would have likely prevented him from being healthy today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. He prioritized his health to avoid common side effects like bad skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. He warns against unsafe practices, particularly the cultural trend in some gyms where trainers give steroids to teenagers without proper medical supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, emphasizing the importance of thorough research before use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

Coleman also notes that steroid use can actually lead to being "less sexually active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, as the body isn't accustomed to the foreign substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

## Flexibility and Functional Fitness

Coleman diligently incorporated stretching into his routine, stemming from his football background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. He would stretch for 20-30 minutes every night after cardio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a> and was even able to do splits on stage despite his massive 300+ lb physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. He believes stretching contributes to hypertrophy by making the body more flexible and removing limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, ultimately helping him stay "normal" and functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

Interestingly, Coleman states he rarely experienced muscle soreness after workouts, indicating it's not a universal sign of muscle building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Guidance for Aspiring Bodybuilders

Coleman's primary advice for young bodybuilders is to seek "knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. He emphasizes learning from multiple knowledgeable coaches, as one individual cannot provide all necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This comprehensive knowledge should cover [[role_of_diet_and_nutrition | diet]], training, and recovery—everything it takes to become a champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.

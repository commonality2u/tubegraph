The content creator known as CarryMina, or Ajay Nagar, emphasizes the significance of personal experience and continuous growth in one's life and career. He believes in giving 100% effort in any endeavor, regardless of the outcome, to avoid future regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For him, the aim is to be able to say he gave his all, and if it didn't work, then to simply move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Distinguishing Public and Private Selves

Ajay Nagar sees a clear distinction between his public persona, CarryMina, and his private self. While he keeps the character of CarryMina very open, sharing everything about it, his personal identity as Ajay remains private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He feels there are certain parts of his personal life he doesn't want to share, and to maintain that privacy, he keeps it entirely separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This preference for privacy stems from childhood, as he has always been an introvert who enjoys staying home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His room serves as his "world," where he works, plays games, and relaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

He appreciates his private space and avoids "unwanted things" that can arise from public interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For example, he finds it challenging when fans use the same language in front of his parents as he does in his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Approach to Life and Goals

Ajay Nagar focuses on living in the present rather than planning far into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. His primary goal is to continue what he is doing, taking "one day at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### The Value of Experience
A core belief for Ajay is the importance of continuous learning through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He states that the more experience one gains, the better it is for personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He contrasts this with traditional education, arguing that while some fields like surgery require formal schooling, true understanding often comes from personal experience and finding one's own learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. He encourages people to learn in their own way, even if it's difficult, as it leads to a unique outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Independence and Fulfillment
He considers his independence to be the best part of his life, allowing him to do what he wants without parental pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. He states that he literally has no problems in life and is doing everything he desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, having achieved many of his dreams at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This early fulfillment, however, sometimes makes him feel like his dreams are "ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Challenges of Fame and [[personal_journeys_and_overcoming_failure | Personal Journeys and Overcoming Failure]]

Being a famous teenager in India presents unique difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Ajay highlights how fame impacts normal teenage experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He has missed out on basic life skills like learning to drive due to lack of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He also regrets not experiencing college life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, expressing a desire to live in a hostel or flat share to understand that experience, partly for personal growth and partly to create relatable content for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Learning from Experience
He believes that to achieve stability and growth, one must keep evolving and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Many people fear failure, but he encourages secret experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He advises against taking pressure, as it often leads to things going wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. His family, particularly his parents, are also navigating his fame, learning how to deal with it together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Final Advice: Embrace All Experiences

His ultimate advice for everyone is to "experience things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He encourages people to never say no to anything and to step out of their comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Even if an experience turns out badly, it will be a source of laughter and reflection years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. He suggests that experiencing different things could even lead to life-changing discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

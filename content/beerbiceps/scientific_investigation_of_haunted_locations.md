Dr. Savio Fado, a demonologist and psychic, works alongside Sarjit Mohanty and Puja Vijay in the field of [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Their work on TRS, a horror special, aims not to introduce darkness but to foster understanding, enabling movement towards light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

## Defining [[paranormal_investigation_methods | Paranormal Investigations]]

Dr. Fado prefers the term "[[paranormal_investigation_methods | paranormal investigations]] research" over "ghost hunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:41">[06:17:41]</a>. He brings a strong sense of [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | skepticism]] to his work, questioning everything that occurs during investigations and [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | exorcisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>. His background includes handwriting analysis, graphology, NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) practice, hypnotherapy, face reading, and behavior analysis, which collectively make it challenging to deny the existence of something beyond the observable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:01">[03:47:01]</a>.

## Investigation Methodology

The team employs a multi-faceted approach to investigate potentially haunted locations:

### Scouting and Peripheral Audit
*   **Scouting** involves physically visiting a location to identify any anomalies, including both spiritual phenomena and potential human interference, such as wild animals, drunkards, or druggists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:21">[04:25:21]</a>.
*   **Peripheral audit** is a spiritual assessment to determine if a place is genuinely haunted and worthy of a full investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:49">[04:56:49]</a>. Not every abandoned place or location where a death occurred is haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:01">[05:06:01]</a>.

### Scientific Procedure
Their investigations utilize scientific devices that measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) and wave radiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:26">[06:24:26]</a>. However, Dr. Fado emphasizes that [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | spirituality]] is the science of the paranormal, suggesting a deeper understanding of human senses and biology beyond current technological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

### Psychometry
Dr. Fado employs psychometry, an ability to read the history and energy of objects and surfaces by touching them, using the body's nerve endings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This method has yielded corroborated results, such as sensing underground tunnels at a location in Alibag, which was later confirmed by a local resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. He believes that if these sensations (flashes of light, colors, faces, voices) could be translated into technology, it could revolutionize fields like crime solving by eliminating the need for witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

## Understanding [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | Spirits, Ghosts, and Demonic Entities]]

### Demonic Possession and [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | Exorcism]]
*   **Demonic possession** is viewed as a "sickness" or an unwanted disease within the body, soul, or spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. An exorcist's role is to help remove this "sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   Demons are present "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a> and are believed to feed off negative emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   Individuals become vulnerable to attachment when there's a "gap" in their aura or if they possess negative surplus energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | Exorcism]] involves diagnosing the specific type of demon afflicting a person, similar to how a doctor diagnoses an illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Each demon has a weakness that can be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | Exorcisms]] are not always dramatic; they can be calm and relaxed. The process can take several hours, especially if the person is unwilling or if the demon needs to be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   During an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | exorcism]], the afflicted person may not be aware of the entity but realizes their actions were wrong once the manic phase subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

### The Most Challenging Case of Demonic Possession
Dr. Fado recounts a challenging case involving two boys exhibiting similar demonic possession symptoms concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
<br>
> "When this person is trying to stab himself, that person is trying to take something and stab someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>
<br>
Through careful observation and a discreet meeting with their parents, he discovered that the boys were half-brothers, sharing the same father who was involved in pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. The father's illicit activities seemed to synchronize with the boys' manic phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. The possessions stopped after the father committed suicide, leading to questions about whether it was the exorcist's intervention, the universe's conspiracy, the father's action, or the demon's self-annihilation that resolved the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

### Types of Entities
*   **Demons:** Free radicals of energy that acquire negative spiritual memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. They have never walked the Earth in a human form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Some are more potent, causing illusions, hallucinations, or manipulating core aspects of a person like memory, conscience, and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. These can manipulate the mind to normalize evil actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
*   **Ghosts:** Entities that were once human and may appear visually like normal people, not necessarily scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. They may not realize they are dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. They gain energy from sources like EMF, light, plants, or other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Poltergeists:** Entities that can physically manipulate the environment, throwing objects or shattering glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. They are not necessarily human spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

### Interaction with Entities
*   Entities do not typically want to scare or latch onto people unless their presence is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   Communication with ghosts is primarily telepathic, as they lack physical senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>.
*   Some entities refuse to cross over due to unresolved desires like concerns about family, property, or a desire for revenge if they died an unnatural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

### The Most Uncomfortable Location
Dr. Fado considers his own house to be the most haunted due to the collection of "charged objects" or [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | haunted objects]] he stores there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. One significant object is a large mirror on his loft that can open portals, serving as a doorway for multiple entities from different dimensions to enter and exit this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

### Portal Creation
*   Mirrors can potentially be portals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>, especially when facing each other, creating an endless loop that acts as a passageway for other-worldly entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   Natural portals can occur where three or four elements interact, such as water bodies or specific tree formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   A house can become a portal if objects emitting high EMF (like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, or refrigerators) are placed in specific configurations, such as a triangle, leading to entities visually walking through walls and doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   Ouija boards are not necessarily portals, but their interaction relies on the ideomotor effect (micro-muscle movements) and information from the participants' subconscious memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. However, they can still invite entities if approached with the intention of doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>.

## Personal Protection and Cleansing
Dr. Fado does not allow entities to latch onto him after cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. He performs spiritual hygiene and cleanses locations immediately after investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. His constant meditative state helps densify his aura, acting as a shield against entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## The Most Difficult Entity Encounter
Dr. Fado describes an encounter with a powerful and obstinate entity at a dilapidated temple outside Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. The entity was the spirit of a woman who had killed an entire family in revenge in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. The spirit actively resisted communication on gadgets and physically restrained Dr. Fado by activating thick plant branches, blocking his path, an experience that had never happened before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. Despite the aggression, empathy is still required to encourage interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. This powerful entity had likely learned to sustain itself and gather energy for decades, manipulating the physical realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>, possibly feeding off the energy of dark rituals performed in the temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

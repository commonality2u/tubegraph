India's geopolitical influence is an evolving landscape, marked by its efforts to shape global narratives, manage complex relationships, and leverage its soft power. The nation aims to establish a credible and impactful global media presence, which is seen as crucial for its international standing and the perception of its legitimacy [[indias_foreign_policy | India's foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:50">[02:17:50]</a>.

## Shaping Global Narratives and Soft Power

A key aspect of [[indias_foreign_policy | India's foreign policy]] involves its soft power. According to journalist Palki Sharma, maligning India on a global stage by fellow Indians negatively impacts the nation's soft power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. She emphasizes that every Indian outside the country is a brand ambassador for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. A concerning trend highlighted is the perception that to be considered a "true journalist" by some Western audiences, one must "diss India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

The need for validation from Western powers is seen as a mental hangover from colonial powers, affecting perceptions of India's democracy and freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Double standards are evident in the global response to protests; for instance, blocking highways in India is framed as a righteous cause, while similar actions in Canada lead to police intervention deemed acceptable for maintaining law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

### Media Presence and Perception
India's media presence on a global scale is currently limited, with the nation being "nowhere in the picture" compared to international counterparts like Al Jazeera, BBC, RT, CNN, France 24, and Channel NewsAsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. While platforms like the Washington Post and New York Times influence global perspectives, Indian media lacks similar reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:50">[02:17:50]</a>. This lack of global media presence means India's intentions are questioned and its reach is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

The narrative built by media can shape how the world views a country. For example, Hollywood movies depicting the US military as courageous or saving the world constantly build a narrative that influences global opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>. While Bollywood acts as a soft power, presenting India as a "fun loving singing dancing society," it does not necessarily translate into a favorable perception of India's economic or political standing in the eyes of an international viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a>. Negative perceptions, such as India being unsafe or having excessive red tapism, can deter investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>. It is crucial to address true problems while also correcting outdated perceptions, such as India being a "land of snake charmers" rather than a "land of coders" with high AI adoption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>.

Individual content creators, such as Palki Sharma, are seen as playing a significant role in changing the perception of India by leveraging social media algorithms to reach wider international audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:40">[02:37:40]</a>.

## Geopolitical Stance and Relations

### India-China Relations
Relations between India and China are characterized by a lack of sincerity in conversations, despite numerous rounds of talks, such as the 20 rounds of talks since the Galwan clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. [[indiachina_geopolitical_tensions_and_historical_conflicts | China's refusal to accept or respect borders]] is seen as a primary cause of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. China's expenditure on internal security is higher than on external security, reflecting its fear of internal protests, which explains its tight curbs on information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. China's "peaceful rise" narrative has shifted under Xi Jinping, who is perceived as having "overplayed his hand" by provoking many countries while facing internal challenges like a debt bubble and public anger over the property market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>.

### Defense Market
India is an emerging player in the global defense market. While the American military-industrial complex is very strong, many countries cannot afford its weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. India is attempting to sell its effective and cost-effective weapons to countries like the Philippines (BrahMos missile deal) and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. This contrasts with the presence of Russian Wagner group and Chinese inroads in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>.

## Economic and Trade Relations

### Post-Brexit Britain and India
Post-Brexit, Britain's economy is struggling, leading it to seek new trade partnerships. This has led to ongoing discussions about a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. However, negotiations are slow as both sides "are holding their ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. Britain's internal issues, such as immigration challenges and a struggling healthcare system, also impact its global standing and desire for new economic alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

## Global Conflicts and India's Role

India aims to stay out of global conflicts where possible. While the US and China focus on soft power, India's expenditure on soft power initiatives like yoga and Ayurveda is a "fraction" compared to military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. India, as a multi-polar world actor, has figured out it can stand up for itself and does not necessarily have to do what "big powers are telling them to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.

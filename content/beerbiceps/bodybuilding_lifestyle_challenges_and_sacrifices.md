Bodybuilding, especially at an elite level, is widely considered one of the hardest sports in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. It demands immense commitment, discipline, and significant personal sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, emphasizes that the sport is a 24/7, 365-day commitment, where "you can't really slip up" due to constant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Demanding Nature and Loneliness
While not a lonely journey for Coleman due to strong [[Family life and parenting challenges | family support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, the competitive lifestyle inherently involves significant social sacrifices. During his preparation for competitions, Coleman describes "real real dark times" where he couldn't engage in normal social activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Key sacrifices included:
*   Inability to go out to eat, go to dinner, or attend movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Missing parties, weddings, and amusement parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Limited social interaction, as "everything was about bodybuilding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Coleman notes that he is only now, after his competitive career, truly able to "sit back, relax and soak it all in" and enjoy the benefits of his past victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Dietary Regimen
One of the most challenging aspects of bodybuilding is the strict and demanding diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. To achieve the necessary size, bodybuilders must consume massive amounts of food, regardless of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

Ronnie Coleman's diet for winning his first Olympia was an extraordinary feat:
*   Six meals a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   A pound of chicken with every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Waking up in the middle of the night to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   Forced himself to eat until his body adapted to the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. His nutritionist increased his portion sizes from 10 ounces to 16 ounces per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   This intense food intake led to frequent bowel movements, sometimes after every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

Coleman attributes his "thickness" and overall size and definition to his heavy lifting and dietary intake, particularly the consumption of red meat, even though he only ate it once a day compared to chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. He notes that while one "can" build muscle with just chicken and fish, they likely "can't look like I did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. His body is used to bland food, making spicy cuisines like Indian food difficult to digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Physical Impact and Steroid Use
The pursuit of a competitive physique often involves the use of performance-enhancing substances. Ronnie Coleman openly discusses his use of steroids, emphasizing that it was always doctor-prescribed and closely monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

Key points on steroid use:
*   Started at 30 years old (around 1995-1996) out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
*   Received guidance from Flex Wheeler, a respected figure in bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   Underwent regular check-ups every four months to ensure liver, kidney, and heart health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.
*   Maintained "normal dosage" rather than "massive amounts" to avoid adverse health effects seen in others, such as bad skin, pimples, and excessive veins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   Stresses the critical need for doctor guidance and regular body check-ups (at least every six months) when using steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   Noted that steroid use can lead to reduced sexual activity, as the body isn't "used to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. During show preparation, he abstained from sex and masturbation, as it wasn't a priority for winning the Olympia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

Despite numerous surgeries (13-14 on his back, hips, and neck), Coleman maintains a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. He notes a physical weakening after each surgery, being unable to lift as much as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. However, he believes continuing to train, even with herniated discs, helped rehabilitate his body and prevented further deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. Coleman himself rarely experienced muscle soreness after workouts, unlike others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.

## Mental Fortitude and Training Philosophy
Coleman's dominance in bodybuilding was not solely due to physical prowess, but also an incredible [[Mental focus and training philosophy in bodybuilding | mental edge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He maintained commitment, trained harder than competitors, and often entered the gym with an "attitude," viewing training as "going to war" to protect his title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

His mental approach included:
*   Extreme determination, focus, motivation, and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   Perseverance through obstacles, with a strong faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Visualization: He would mentally "do it before it's already done," picturing heavy lifts like 800lb squats for weeks before actually attempting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. His only regret with an 800lb squat was not visualizing more reps, as he felt he could have done six or seven but only planned for two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Despite the intensity, Coleman described the constant repetition and routine of bodybuilding as "boringness" and a "recycle thing," highlighting the monotony required for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. His mentality helped him maintain a positive outlook, even through challenging moments like the end of his Olympia streak, which he processed in a couple of hours, accepting that "everything comes to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

## Daily Life Adaptations
The extreme physique of a top bodybuilder necessitates significant adjustments in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>:
*   Cars sometimes had to be sold because he gained too much weight for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   Clothing required tailoring, as off-the-rack clothes would not fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Even his police uniforms were tailor-made from his first day on the job due to his already significant size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Post-Competition Life and Advice
After his competitive career, Coleman emphasizes enjoying life more, including [[Family life and parenting challenges | spending time with family]] and having the freedom to eat what he wants, travel, and go to movies and restaurants, activities that were restricted during his competitive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

His advice for young bodybuilders focuses on continuous learning and seeking diverse expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>:
*   Acquire extensive knowledge about diet, training, and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   Seek guidance from multiple knowledgeable coaches, not just one, to continuously learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   Embrace the hard work and consistency needed, whether it's through heavy lifting for size and thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> or consistent training for overall muscle development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
*   He stressed that functional fitness is important, as he practiced stretching daily due to his football background, which allowed him to remain flexible even at his peak size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

Coleman highlights that "everybody's body is different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>, and while specific training methods like high reps (e.g., 100 reps) were done for fun and not for size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>, consistent training at fixed rep ranges (like 20, 15, 12, 10 to failure) was key to his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. He also recommends massage therapy for relaxation and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

Maintaining neat, crease-free clothing is essential for a polished appearance, as creases can "absolutely ruin" your look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Every man should know how to iron his own clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Essential Tools

To start, acquire a good quality steam iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Irons with a "steam burst feature" are particularly useful as they can moisten clothes, easing the ironing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## General Ironing Tips

*   **Moistening Clothes:** Traditionally, clothes are moistened with a water spray before ironing to help remove creases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Modern steam irons with a steam burst feature can perform this function automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **[[selecting_the_perfect_tshirt_fit | T-Shirts]] and Polos:** Ironing these items is straightforward; simply look for creases and iron over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Detailed Shirt Ironing Routine

Ironing a shirt requires a specific sequence of steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>:

1.  **Collar:** Lay the collar flat on the ironing surface. Iron one side, then flip the shirt over and iron the second side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Cuffs:** Open the cuffs. Start by ironing the inside, then flip them over and iron the outside. Be sure to avoid damaging the buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
3.  **Front Side:** Lay the front of the shirt completely flat. Iron using straight strokes, again dodging any buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Once the main body of the front is done, iron the placket (the part with button slots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
4.  **Yoke:** Move to the yoke, which is the part of the shirt on your upper back. Iron over it in straight strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
5.  **Back Body:** Iron the back body of the shirt using straight strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
6.  **Sleeves:** Lay each sleeve out flat on the surface. Start at the top and iron all the way down to the cuffs. Turn the sleeve over and repeat the process. Then, move on to the other sleeve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Post-Ironing Care

After ironing, it's crucial to hang your shirt in the air for about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. If you fold it immediately while it's still warm, it will likely get creased again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Allowing it to hang and cool helps the material stretch out and set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

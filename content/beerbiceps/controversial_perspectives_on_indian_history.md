Discussions around [[historical_perspectives_on_india_and_china_relations | Indian history]] are increasingly prevalent, particularly online, as younger generations express dissatisfaction with the education system's portrayal of the past. Many believe that school textbooks teach an incomplete, irrelevant, and biased version of history, often omitting crucial events and figures and focusing narrowly on specific regions or narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>.

## Critique of Mainstream Historical Narratives

Historically, Indian textbooks have been criticized for presenting a "Delhi-centric" view, largely ignoring the contributions and histories of vast regions and powerful dynasties outside of Delhi, such as the Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire, Rashtrakutas, and Ahom rulers, who governed for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:40">[03:48:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:58">[07:00:58]</a>. The focus has often been on a linear, simplified, and monochromatic view of the Indian Freedom Struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:51">[04:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The term "Revolutionary Terrorists"
> Delhi University textbooks and UPSC books, authored by figures like Bipin Chandra and Mridula Mukherjee, have used the term "revolutionary terrorists" to describe freedom fighters such as Bhagat Singh and Bagha Jatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This colonial-era term, coined by British masters, continues to be used, despite protests from descendants of figures like Bhagat Singh, who highlight its inappropriate nature in independent India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

## Unveiling Hidden Chapters of the Freedom Struggle

The mainstream narrative often emphasizes the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:50">[05:08:50]</a>. However, an alternative narrative highlights an "unending chain" of armed resistance and revolutionaries from 1857 until 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### The Naval Mutiny of 1946

This event, which began in Bombay (now Mumbai), involved sailors protesting their conditions, which then escalated into demands for national liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:52">[13:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:49">[14:02:49]</a>. The mutiny, inspired by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA) trials, spread across India, including South India, Karachi, and Jabalpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:49">[14:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:16">[14:14:16]</a>.
<br>
British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who oversaw India's independence, reportedly stated in 1952-53 that the heroics of the INA and the subsequent mutinies in the Navy and Army were the primary reasons for Britain's swift departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. He considered the impact of Gandhi's non-violent Quit India movement minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. The British feared a repeat of the 1857 uprising if the Indian forces turned against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Suppressing Alternate Viewpoints
> After independence, the prevailing political dispensation aimed to highlight a specific viewpoint of the freedom struggle, particularly the non-violent movement and the Congress's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>. Any opposing narratives or individuals not aligned with this framework were marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. For instance, historian R.C. Majumdar was removed from a government-commissioned project to chronicle the freedom struggle because he intended to be critical of Mahatma Gandhi's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

## Geopolitics and Historical Narratives

Geopolitical powers, especially the Western bloc (Britain, then America), are believed to have influenced the shaping of historical narratives about India's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. This influence allegedly reinforced the branding of figures like Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. The British, aiming to portray their departure as peaceful, benefited from a narrative that downplayed violent resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

Some historians also point to the role of "collaborators" during the British Raj who later held positions of power in independent India's bureaucracy and intellectual circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:50]</a>. An example cited is Yashpal, an individual allegedly "our man" according to British intelligence reports, who later became a celebrated intellectual and author in independent India, receiving awards and writing books that perpetuated a specific version of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

## Re-evaluating V.D. Savarkar

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar is a key figure whose historical role is debated. He founded India's first organized secret society, Abhinav Bharat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. In 1905, he initiated the first student bonfire of foreign clothes, a full 22 years before Mahatma Gandhi's similar act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>. While in London as a law student, he led the revolutionary movement and authored "The First War of Indian Independence" about the 1857 Uprising, which became a foundational text for future revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>.

Savarkar endured 14 years of imprisonment (12 in Kalapani and 2 in Indian mainland jails), followed by 13 years of house arrest in Ratnagiri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. His degrees were snatched, family property confiscated, and his family faced destitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.

### "Mercy Petitions" and [[hindutva | Hindutva]]

Critics often cite Savarkar's "mercy petitions" to the British as evidence of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a>. However, these were common legal applications filed by many political prisoners, not exclusively by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>. British records themselves indicate he showed "no regret or repentance or remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. Many petitions were filed on behalf of other younger revolutionaries who lacked legal knowledge or English proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.

His concept of [[hindutva | Hindutva]], as defined in his book "Essentials of Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?", is presented as a cultural and national identity, distinct from the theological aspects of Hinduism as a religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>. He envisioned it as an affiliation to the Indian nation (Hindustan) for anyone, regardless of their religious background (Jain, Muslim, Parsi, Sikh), provided they considered India as their "punyabhoomi" (holy land) and "pitrubhoomi" (ancestral land) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. During his house arrest, he actively worked towards caste eradication and unifying Hindu society, advocating for a complete elimination of the caste system, not just untouchability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[42:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>.

## The Horrors of Kalapani (Cellular Jail)

The Cellular Jail in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, also known as Kalapani, was one of the most horrific prisons built by the British, designed to break the spirit of political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:34:00">[49:34:00]</a>.
<br>
It housed primarily revolutionaries, not Congress members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>. Inhuman tortures included:
*   Lack of basic human rights like good food, drinking water, or proper toilet facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.
*   "Standing handcuffs" and legs tied for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.
*   Food often contained pieces of reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:58:00">[44:58:00]</a>.
*   Prisoners forced to defecate and urinate in their cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>.
*   The "Kukal Bell" punishment, where political prisoners were yoked to an oil-grinding machine, replacing bullocks, and forced to extract 30 lbs of oil daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>. Failure to meet the quota resulted in whiplashes and denial of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.
*   Poor clothing causing skin rashes, and lack of medical treatment for ailments including leech bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>.
*   Many prisoners, often young men in their teens and twenties, committed suicide or went mad due to the tortures, leading to the creation of an asylum on Haddo Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:19:00">[46:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.
*   Savarkar, a prolific poet, memorized thousands of lines of his poetry written with charcoal on cell walls after jailers whitewashed them to spite him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>.

Many historians advocate for Kalapani to be a place of pilgrimage for Indian students to acknowledge and pay tribute to the immense sacrifices made for freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>.

## Nathuram Godse and Savarkar's Association

Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, was initially a trusted confidant and secretary to Savarkar within the Hindu Mahasabha's youth wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>. However, Godse stated in court that Savarkar became a "pacifist" closer to independence, advocating support for the new Indian government, which led Godse and other hot-blooded young men to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:32:00">[52:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>.

Godse's motivations for assassinating Gandhi included the perceived failure to adequately address the partition's violence and refugee crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19:00">[53:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>. A critical turning point was Gandhi's call on January 12, 1948, to fast unto death if the Indian government did not pay 50 crores (500 million rupees) to Pakistan as promised, at a time when Pakistani forces were making incursions into Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:57:00">[54:57:00]</a>. Godse and others viewed this as a national security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:00">[55:15:00]</a>.

Savarkar was implicated in Gandhi's murder but honorably exonerated by the court in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:19:00">[58:19:00]</a>. A 2018 Supreme Court bench, after reviewing documents, upheld his exoneration, ruling that the insinuation of his involvement in the conspiracy was "null and void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:46:00">[58:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>.

### The 1948 Anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin Carnage

Following Gandhi's assassination, an "anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin carnage" occurred across Maharashtra, spearheaded by Congress goons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This retaliation targeted members of the community to which Godse belonged. Many Maharashtrian Brahmins were killed, lost property, and faced ethnic cleansing, with no cases filed or justice provided by the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Many victims' descendants still prefer anonymity due to the political power of the perpetrators' successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## Lessons for the Present

The "divide and rule" strategy, used against India for over a thousand years by invaders and colonizers, continues to manifest in contemporary internal divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. To move forward, India needs to confront and heal from its troubled past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This means acknowledging historical truths, even uncomfortable ones, without using history as a tool for political correctness or fabricating narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. An honest assessment allows a nation to gain closure and build a stronger future, avoiding the repetition of past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

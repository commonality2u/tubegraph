The [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | Ketogenic Diet]] is fundamentally characterized by a very low carbohydrate intake. This strict limit on carbohydrates is crucial for the diet's effectiveness in promoting fat loss and maintaining ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Daily Carbohydrate Limit
For the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] to be effective, your total daily carbohydrate intake must remain below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This strict limit is repeatedly emphasized as the core principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Evolution of Fat Intake
Initially, while following the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], you can consume greasier foods, provided your carbs stay under 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, as you progress, it becomes necessary to reduce fat intake to ensure you remain under your maintenance calories for continued fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The [[meal_plan_for_keto_diet | diet plan]] presented is more typical for later stages of keto, when calories are lower, and food should not be excessively greasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Strategic Carbohydrate Allocation
The specific sources from which you obtain your 20 grams of carbohydrates are highly significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is ideal to fill this allowance with nutrient-dense options rather than dairy or cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Essential Green Leafy Vegetables
Incorporating green leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, and spinach is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. These can be stir-fried with ingredients like garlic and curry leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. You must meticulously count carbohydrates from all sources, including small amounts from vegetables and even garlic cloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Neglecting this part of the diet can lead to deficiencies and severe constipation, making it a health necessity despite the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Impact on Meal Choices
The low carbohydrate requirement influences nearly every [[foods_to_eat_and_avoid_on_a_ketogenic_diet | food]] choice on the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]]:
*   **Protein Shakes:** While milk is a common base, for an ideal [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], protein shakes should be mixed with water to minimize dairy intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Isolate protein supplements are preferred due to their lower carb and calorie content and faster absorption compared to whey concentrates, though concentrates are also permissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Pre-Workout Meals:** Traditional pre-workout meals rich in carbohydrates are not an option on keto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A simple four-egg omelette cooked with minimal oil is a suitable alternative to keep the stomach full without excessive carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation:** For those accustomed to high-carb pre-workout meals, adjusting to the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] lifestyle might be challenging initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Psychological Aspect
Adhering to a [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] requires significant psychological strength, especially if you have a strong affinity for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The [[pros_and_cons_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] may not be suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

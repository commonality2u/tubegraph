In a candid discussion, content creator Tanmay Bhat delves into his personal journey through significant challenges, the impact on his mental health, and the profound lessons learned through self-exploration and a shift in perspective.

## The Journey Through Challenges
Tanmay Bhat's journey began with an early life mentorship, where he trained his mentor, Tanmay B, in physical fitness in exchange for guidance in the media industry, a time when YouTube earnings were minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This reciprocal relationship highlights the [[bodybuilding_challenges_and_rewards | challenges and rewards]] of their respective fields.

Tanmay identifies several pivotal "worst moments" in his life:
*   **Academic Disappointment** Receiving 65% in his 12th standard exams, a dramatic drop from 90% in 10th grade, led to him binge-eating and avoiding going home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Family Stress from Controversy** Witnessing his parents sob and question his career choices after the Sachin controversy, especially following the roast incident a year prior, caused immense stress, particularly as his father had recently undergone a bypass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **The Disintegration of AIB** The most profound challenge was the disbandment of AIB and the difficult decision to let all employees go, which led to Tanmay breaking down and crying in front of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This event marked a severe financial debt for AIB, as all brand deals disappeared overnight and projects were left unfinished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

## Impact on Mental Health and Self-Worth
The disbandment of AIB forced Tanmay to question his entire life, having spent 10 years building the company and working closely with its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. For a period, he struggled with not having an office to go to, leading to deep self-reflection about whether his self-worth was solely tied to his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. This period, though dark, was also enlightening, leading to a [[personal_growth_and_selfexploration | personal reinvention]] and the realization that he was still a person capable of things beyond his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:47]</a>.

He highlights a key societal challenge: the metric of success is often solely measured by career achievements and wealth, rather than happiness, friendships, or family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Tanmay observes that much of his own "hustle" stemmed from a desire to fill a void, driven by insecurities from growing up as an overweight child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

### The Role of Public Perception and Insecurity
Tanmay shares his perspective on how public perception and social media contribute to unhealthy mental states. He notes that news prioritizes views over truth, simplifying complex issues and fostering immediate judgment and anger online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. This creates a "black or white" view of people, whereas in reality, "everybody's gray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. He learned that individuals who are least accepting of others' flaws are often unaware of their own, and a lack of empathy typically signifies a lack of self-introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

He acknowledges his own arrogance in the past as a manifestation of deep-seated insecurity, noting that managers who are cruel often compensate for their own insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Fostering Well-being

### Seeking Support and Environment Change
Diagnosed with clinical depression in December of the prior year, Tanmay decided to move to Bangalore to escape the media-centric environment of Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. His friend Kunal Shah advised him to surround himself with people outside his domain to turn sadness into fuel for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:07]</a>. This shift exposed him to the startup world and a more optimistic, collaborative environment focused on wealth creation rather than status games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>.

### Therapy and Self-Awareness
Tanmay engaged in intense therapy, leading to a significant increase in [[personal_growth_and_selfexploration | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:07]</a>. He realized his excessive dependence on external validation, an "illness" common among social media influencers, which he attributes partly to childhood experiences like "daddy issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>. Therapy, for him, is like going to the gym for the head, providing a structured space to process thoughts and gain objectivity that even close friends cannot offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.

### The Power of Routine and Long-Term Games
A new, strict daily routine, waking at 2 PM and working through the night, has brought him immense happiness and clarity after a year of lacking motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He emphasizes the amazing power of a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This new approach reflects a commitment to playing "long-term games" and understanding that success doesn't need to happen immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>.

### Physical Fitness and Emotional Processing
Tanmay's past experience with extreme weight gain, reaching 245 kilograms, led to acute sleep apnea and a near-death experience where his neck muscles collapsed, and he stopped breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. This traumatic event, shortly after the AIB roast, was a turning point to "get his s--- in order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:24:00">[50:24:00]</a>. His overeating was a way to manage stress and anxiety, eating non-stop without recognizing hunger cues, often out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.

He views [[bodybuilding_challenges_and_rewards | weight loss]] as an equally painful mental exercise as it is physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:53:00">[58:53:00]</a>. Mastering one's brain is crucial, which requires significant emotional processing. He acknowledges that deep down, he may not have believed he deserved happiness, leading to a self-sabotaging desire to remain overweight due to childhood bullying and suppressed trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:10:00">[59:10:00]</a>. He advises overweight children who are bullied to allow themselves to cry and process their trauma, as men often lack the skills to handle their emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:32:00">[57:32:00]</a>.

The process of losing weight significantly boosts confidence and changes one's thought process, making individuals feel more confident and capable in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.

### Wisdom and Patience
At 32, Tanmay believes wisdom comes from the number of experiences in a year, not just years lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. He has learned immense patience and the crucial lesson that "life is incredibly long" and doesn't require everything to happen immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. His approach to life now is to "make games and have fun playing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

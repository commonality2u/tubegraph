Priyanka Chopra Jonas, in a conversation on The Ranveer Show, shares her evolving perspective on success and the [[sudha_murthys_perspective_on_the_meaning_of_life | meaning of life]], highlighting the shift from a romanticized view of relentless work to an emphasis on [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | work-life balance]] and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Reimagining Success

Traditionally, success was often romanticized as working "24 hours," doing "four movies in one time," and "five shifts," with the belief that "the more a person does that, the more successful you will be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, through living more life, Chopra has realized the critical importance of [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. She recounts a recent trip to Turks and Caicos where she disconnected from her phones, spending time with her husband, walking on the beach, and collecting shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This break left her feeling "rejuvenated," "excited," and "really motivated to take my career forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

She now believes that work can be a "companion," "creative," and "something that gives you Joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Her current approach involves working intensely on her various ventures, such as her business, production, book, and acting, but also ensuring she switches off to be with family, watch movies, and relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This balance allows her to return to work with focus and increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Redefining Life Goals

Chopra reflects on her past dream of retiring early to live in a "shack in Goa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, she now recognizes her deep love for her job and the ability to create in diverse ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Being in a privileged position, which she created herself, she doesn't want to give it up, viewing it as her "legacy for my children and for the future generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

She emphasizes that success is "very subjective to each person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. What one person considers successful might not appeal to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

## Priyanka Chopra's Personal Journey

Priyanka Chopra's journey is cited as one of India's biggest success stories, marked by her global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. She reflects on her growth and increased sense of calm, attributing it to maturity, being over 35, and having "my feet on the ground on a little bit more stable ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. She no longer feels the need for validation from others, which has made her "a little bit more happy and calm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | Overcoming Challenges]]

Chopra's move to America required her to "strip every single thing that I knew in India" and start from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. Despite having an "incredible career" and "amazing credibility" in India, she had to "walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. She accepted small roles in big Hollywood movies, acknowledging that "every new actor starts there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. It took her 10 years of consistent effort to land her first leading role in the US, and she only received the same remuneration as male co-actors in 2020, 21 years into her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. This journey involved "sweat, tears and blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

She also addresses the jealousy and attempts by others to jeopardize her career in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. Her advice is to "shut off the noise" and focus on the "one person that believes in you" or the "little sliver of light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

### The Power of Gratitude and Purpose

Chopra strongly believes in karma and reincarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. She wakes up every day with a "sense of gratitude" and a desire to "give back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. She reflects on why she has been "lucky enough to have the life that I do" while others with similar [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | desires and ambitions]] do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This contemplation makes her feel she "did something right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

For Chopra, the [[sudha_murthys_perspective_on_the_meaning_of_life | meaning of life]] is "having purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. She states that "what you do in between [birth and death] is your legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. The "pursuit should be what am I doing in my life, what do I want to do in my life, who do I want to be, who do I want to touch, what do I want to create" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Ultimately, it's about making choices that bring "peaceful" feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

## Advice for Young Women and Professionals

Chopra encourages young women to defy "cookie cutter mold[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, noting that many young women are already "fearless" and "take charge of their own lives," changing the "trajectory of their [[the_influence_of_family_dynamics_on_success | families]]" through their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Embracing Boldness and Internal Empowerment

She challenges societal narratives that dictate how women "should be seen not heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> or must behave in a "certain way" to be considered "good girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Her powerful message is: "Good Girls Don't Make History... Bold Girls Make History" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. To be the "lead actor of the of your movie which is your life," one must "take choices that might be contrary to what you've heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This empowerment, she stresses, "comes from you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, even if it's not provided by parents or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. One must find that encouragement "in your gut" because "no one's going to fix your life but you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Learning from Inspiration and Setting Achievable Goals

Chopra advises finding inspiration from others, observing what they do, and then thinking about "what can I do that'll make me feel how I feel about this person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This is about "imbibing from the people around you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

She also touches upon [[manifestation_and_positive_thinking_in_personal_success | manifestation]], stating that "the secret and the vision board" never worked for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Instead, what consistently worked was "having the small next dream" or "The Next Step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. One must "take a step up in the ladder to be able to get to the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This means setting "achievable dreams" and "working backwards from your goal" to identify and take the first steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

### Age and Associations

Chopra advises her younger self not to have "stressed out so much" about losing her job or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. She emphasizes that aging is a natural process and that "age ain't nothing but a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. She highlights examples like Falguni Nayar, who started Nykaa at 50 and built an empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

She strongly advises against keeping "poisonous people" or "toxic" individuals who "mess with your brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Instead, surround yourself only with "people that are genuinely happy for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Journey

Chopra's entrepreneurial journey began when her mother, a doctor and entrepreneur herself, suggested she consider production after turning 30, anticipating the limited "shelf life" for actresses in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. She became fascinated with the "business of entertainment" and learned about production costs and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Her interest further expanded into investments, starting with small ventures that grew significantly, such as Bumble, which she helped bring to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. She saw the "power of being able to have a new idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, especially creating a safe space for women on a dating app in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Her brand, Anomaly, is her first self-founded venture, focusing on clean, affordable, and sustainable haircare made from recycled ocean plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. The success of Anomaly, with one product sold every 7 seconds on its launch day on Nykaa, makes her "feel really proud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. This entrepreneurial drive reflects a broader generational shift where parents are less confined by traditional career paths like doctor or engineer and are open to their children pursuing innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

Chopra emphasizes that her success is not simply "turning to gold" automatically; it's the result of "a year and a half of research" and meticulous work, from formula development to packaging design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. It's "gold because of the [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | work]] that's gone into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

[[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | Focus]] is a deciding factor for success in school, college, or career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While everyone has the same amount of time in a week or day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, successful individuals are not necessarily those who work the hardest, but rather those who can maintain maximum [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] in the minimum amount of work time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Achieving good grades or financial success hinges on one's ability to be [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focused]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

[[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | Focus]] involves staying in one place, shutting out distractions, and concentrating on a single thought or task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Enemies of Focus

While attempting to remain [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focused]], various internal and external "enemies" can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
*   Breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Bad marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Performance pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

These pains and worries are major obstacles to being [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focused]] as they cause one to feel "ungrounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The more grounded you are, the greater your ability to stay in one place and maintain [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. To improve [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]], it's essential to work on your grounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Steps to Improve Grounding and Focus

### 1. Follow a Fitness Routine

Your body is designed for movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Insufficient physical activity leads to an excess of energy, which can make you ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Tiring your body through a [[role_of_fitness_in_enhancing_focus | fitness routine]] helps balance hormones and energies, keeping your mind sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### 2. Choose the Correct Food

What you eat directly impacts your body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Humans evolved eating clean, fresh food over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, in the last 100-200 years, eating habits have shifted, often leading to consuming processed foods with additives and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. A diet high in additives and processed sugar can make you feel more ungrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Therefore, choose fresh foods to witness a positive change in your mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### 3. Work Your Mind Muscle

Just like biceps can be strengthened, your mind is a muscle that can be trained for [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]], grounding, and overall strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The simplest method to ground your mind is through [[breathbased_meditation_for_strengthening_focus | breath-based meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
1.  Sit comfortably with an erect back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
2.  Concentrate solely on your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  If your mind wanders (which is normal), gently bring your attention back to your breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This practice works your [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] "muscle," teaching your mind to return to a single thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Just as your career demands [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] on work tasks, meditation requires [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] on your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Dedicating 20 minutes to training this "brain muscle" can significantly improve your [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | focus]] and maximize human potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. After meditation, you can then use this stronger mental capacity to get work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

ISRO, India's national space agency, holds a positive view of private space entities like [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk's SpaceX]], recognizing their significant contributions to the advancement of space technology and potentially fostering future collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Admiration for Elon Musk and SpaceX
Within ISRO, [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] is seen as an inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Discussions within ISRO meetings often involve quoting [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] when discussing designs and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. ISRO scientists are particularly impressed by:
*   **Reusability**: The concept of reusable rockets and new spacecraft designs are frequently discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Constellation Technology**: The rapid deployment of satellite constellations, like Starlink, is viewed with amazement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Speed and Process Management**: [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]]'s ability to swiftly bring technology to ultimate results and navigate political processes is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen**: Unlike ISRO, which focuses on technology development, [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] is recognized for understanding both the technological and business sides of the space industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

Dr. S. Somnat, the chairperson of ISRO, acknowledges that [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] has utilized his understanding of governmental and political systems to drive technological advancements, such as acquiring a NASA-developed engine for reusable launch vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This strategic approach has enabled [[elon_musks_spacex | SpaceX]] to launch thousands of its own Starlink satellites, which are crucial for national and global communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Dr. Somnat also keeps track of [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]]'s tweets where he has openly supported and praised ISRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Potential for Collaboration
Dr. Somnat expresses a strong willingness to collaborate with [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] and his ventures:
> "Would you be open to it teaming up with Elon Musk? Why not? Definitely." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
> "I'm visualizing Dr. Somnat and Elon Musk back to back like this teaming up for the sake of the moon. We should do. We should do. Yes. Would you be open to it? Why not? Teaming up with Elon Musk. Why not? Definitely." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>

A key condition for such a partnership, from ISRO's perspective, would be to operate on an "equal footing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:44">[02:18:44]</a>.

If given the opportunity to meet [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]], Dr. Somnat would inquire about his vision for moving human beings to exosolar planets, specifically how to achieve the extremely high speeds required to reach such distant destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This aligns with [[isros_plans_for_human_space_missions_to_the_moon_and_mars | ISRO's plans for human space missions to the moon and Mars]] and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.

## Shared Vision and Impact
Both [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] and ISRO share a vision for making space travel more affordable, which is crucial for endeavors like moon mining or asteroid mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>. The use of reusable rockets and cost-effective fuels like methane are areas where [[elon_musks_spacex | SpaceX]] leads and ISRO is also developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>.

Ultimately, ISRO believes that the work done in space, while making India proud, is for the benefit of all humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>. Collaboration with global entities like [[elon_musks_spacex | Elon Musk]] would further this collective goal.

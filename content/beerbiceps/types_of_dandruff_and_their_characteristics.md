Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can manifest in different ways. Understanding the specific type of dandruff is crucial for proper treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Types of Dandruff

The video identifies two main kinds of dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

### Common Dandruff
This type is characterized by "white flakes" that simply fall off your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While it is generally "not really harmful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, it can be "an embarrassing problem to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For most individuals, common dandruff can be managed and cured through specific practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

#### Formation of Common Dandruff
Dandruff forms when the scalp, an active environment constantly producing and shedding skin cells, becomes oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If the scalp is "very oily," these dead skin cells collect, mix with the oil, and form the white flakes that fall off the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

#### Contributing Factors
Common dandruff can be caused by:
*   **Oiling:** Too little or too much oiling of the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Shampooing:** Too little or too much shampooing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Conditioning:** Too little or too much conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Hair Product Usage:** [[hair_care_routine_to_prevent_dandruff | Excess hair product usage]], particularly when products like wax, gels, clays, serums, or creams come into contact with the scalp instead of just the hair body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Environment:** Dandruff is considered an infection, and an [[importance_of_a_clean_environment_to_eliminate_dandruff | infested environment]] can perpetuate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This includes uncleaned pillowcases, combs, brushes, and headgear like caps, hats, and helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Scalp pH Imbalance:** The skin's natural pH is around 5.5, which is slightly acidic and helps kill harmful bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. In people suffering from dandruff, the scalp's pH may be "slightly off" and "may not be as acidic as it should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Soric Dermatitis (Seborrheic Dermatitis)
This more severe form of dandruff is characterized by the presence of white flakes accompanied by "severe itching" in the scalp region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It can also affect areas around the hairline, including the ears, leading to boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. If experiencing soric dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

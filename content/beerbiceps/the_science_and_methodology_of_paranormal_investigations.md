Dr. Savio Fado is a demonologist and psychic who, along with his team, approaches [[role_of_paranormal_investigators_and_varying_beliefs | paranormal investigations]] with a scientific and pragmatic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. He describes spirituality as "the science of the paranormal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The team's intention in discussing horror or paranormal phenomena is to help audiences understand "Darkness so that you can move towards the light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Defining Paranormal Investigations

Savio and his team prefer the term "paranormal investigations research" over "ghost hunts" due to their systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. Their method is described as "extremely scientific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Investigation Methodology

The investigation process involves several layers of analysis:

### 1. Scouting and Peripheral Audit
Before conducting a full investigation, a location undergoes a thorough assessment:
*   **Scouting**: Involves visiting the location to identify any anomalies, whether spiritual or due to human interference (e.g., presence of goons, drunkards, or dangerous animals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Audit**: A spiritual assessment to determine if a place is genuinely haunted or if an investigation is warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Not every abandoned building or place where deaths occurred is haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This step helps to identify if the disturbances are genuinely paranormal or if they can be explained by other factors like Vastu anomalies or electromagnetic field (EMF) pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

### 2. Scientific Tools and Data Collection
The team uses devices to measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF waves) and radiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. These "ghost meters" can spike when an entity is near, as entities can manipulate the electromagnetic medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### 3. [[the_role_of_psychic_abilities_in_paranormal_work | Role of Psychic Abilities]]
Savio integrates his psychic abilities into the scientific process, using them for initial readings that are then corroborated with facts, evidence, and historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Psychometry**: The ability to gain information by touching objects or surfaces due to nerve endings picking up residual energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Savio "reads the rocks" and "interacts with the trees" to get answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This information, like flashes of light, colors, faces, or voices, is documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Human Reading Skills**: Savio utilizes various analytical skills, including handwriting analysis (graphology), face reading, behavior analysis, and body language interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Hypnotherapy**: These skills help him understand human behavior and influence individuals, which can be extended to understanding patterns in locations or entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. He learned that NLP could lead to a "soft telepathy" or non-verbal communication, which he then applied to non-living objects and entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Telepathic Communication with Entities**: Savio interacts with entities telepathically, as they lack physical senses. He explains that telepathy involves manipulating mediums like light, air, water, or fire to project thoughts and vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:33:00">[58:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Goals of Research

The most challenging aspect of paranormal investigations is proving that a place is genuinely haunted and determining how this research benefits humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. The goal is not just to identify haunted locations but to understand how they become haunted, if they can be cleansed, and how to differentiate genuine phenomena from hallucination or hearsay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

Savio envisions a future where this knowledge could be translated into technology, such as a laser that could scan a wall and reveal its history, potentially aiding in solving crime cases without relying on unreliable witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. He believes that by studying the human body's numerous senses (beyond the traditional five), such as intuition, hunger, or balance, we can unlock deeper scientific understandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Understanding Entities and Portals

*   **Entities**: Entities visually appear as they did in their previous lives as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. They generally do not look "scary" as depicted in movies, which often exaggerate for effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>. They can be identified as unnatural when they defy physical laws, such as walking through walls or glowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:13:00">[50:13:00]</a>.
*   **Energy and Manifestation**: Entities gather energy from the environment (e.g., EMF, light, plants, water) to manifest or interact with the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. The stronger an entity, the more it can manipulate physical reality, leading to Poltergeist activities like throwing objects or shattering glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
*   **Portals**: A portal is an entryway or doorway to another dimension or world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:00">[44:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Mirrors**: Not all mirrors are portals, but they can be, especially when two mirrors face each other, creating an endless loop that can serve as a passage for interdimensional entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:00">[44:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Natural Portals**: Some places, where elements like water bodies or trees interact, can naturally create portals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Man-made Portals**: Rituals or the strategic placement of objects emitting strong EMF (e.g., an inverter battery, Wi-Fi router, refrigerator in a triangular formation) can create portals within a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:54:00">[49:54:00]</a>.

## Exorcism and Cleansing
[[Demonology and its study | Demonology]] is treated akin to a "spiritual sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. An exorcist helps with demonic possessions, which Savio describes as "any other sickness that is unwanted in a body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. This includes mental, spiritual, and even physical ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Exorcism is akin to therapy, going beyond mental health treatment to address spiritual diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### The Process of Exorcism
*   **Diagnosis**: The crucial first step in exorcism is to identify the specific "demon" or illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Similar to medical diagnosis, this allows for targeted treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Weakness**: Every "demon" or negative affliction has a weakness that can be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Approach**: Exorcism procedures are not one-size-fits-all; they are tailored to the individual, similar to how mental illnesses are treated uniquely for each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Calmness is Key**: The process needs to be calm and relaxed, avoiding the dramatic portrayals seen in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Fear is detrimental, as demons feed off negative emotions like anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability**: Individuals become susceptible to possession when they are vulnerable, having "gaps in their aura" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Factors**: Exorcism also involves addressing the environment, as a person can revert to their previous state if returned to an unhealthy setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## The Nature of the Occult

Savio notes that anything can become an "occult thing" if one assigns that intention to it, similar to how a piece of wood can be carved into a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

*   **Ouija Boards**: While often seen as occult, Ouija boards primarily operate on the ideomotor effect, where subconscious micro-muscle movements of participants push the planchet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The information comes from the participants' memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. However, there is a risk of inviting entities if approached with the intention to interact with the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Bloody Mary**: Chanting "Bloody Mary" is not inherently dangerous; it only "works" if the person performing the ritual genuinely intends for it to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## [[experiences_and_beliefs_about_the_occult_and_paranormal | Interaction with Entities]]
Entities don't typically realize they are "ghosts" and perceive humans as normal people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. They generally only interact when their presence is acknowledged, as they prefer to conserve their limited energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. While some entities may not be aware of their deceased state and need to be convinced to cross over, others are aware but choose not to due to lingering desires (e.g., revenge, attachment to property, concern for kin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

[[the_role_of_skepticism_in_dealing_with_supernatural_phenomena | Skepticism]] is incorporated into the process, as personal psychic readings are always corroborated with external facts and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. The team gathers confirmations from locals in [[paranormal_investigations_in_india | Indian locations]] by subtly asking questions about the area's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

Savio Fado's work highlights the intricate blend of human perception, scientific measurement, and spiritual understanding in the complex field of paranormal investigation.

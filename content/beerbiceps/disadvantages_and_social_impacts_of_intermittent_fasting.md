While [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]] (IF) offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain disadvantages and can impact one's social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Disadvantages
There are two primary disadvantages to [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>:

### Initial Adjustment Period
Initially, adapting to the [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]] diet can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   It typically takes people a day or two to become accustomed to this new eating pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   During the first and second days of [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]], individuals might experience very low energy levels, particularly in the last two to three hours of their fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   However, by the third and fourth day, most people feel normal, and the fast becomes much easier to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Social Impacts
The second significant disadvantage of [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]] is its potential effect on one's social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | Intermittent fasting]] requires a 16-hour fasting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Many practitioners choose to have their last meal around 10 p.m. and their first meal at 2 p.m. the following day, meaning no food can be consumed during these 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   This schedule may lead to missing social engagements such as breakfast dates, late-night dinners, or drinking sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   The impact on social life can be mitigated by developing a flexible system, such as adjusting the fasting duration (e.g., fasting for 21 hours and eating for 3, or fasting for 12 hours and eating for 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Addressing Parental Concerns
Traditional advice often emphasizes the importance of breakfast for health and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Parents often advise against skipping breakfast out of concern for their children's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   However, fitness [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_benefits | science]] continuously evolves, introducing new concepts like [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   If an individual adopts [[intermittent_fasting_benefits_and_science | intermittent fasting]], parents may view the prolonged fasting as unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   It is crucial to educate oneself and one's parents about the scientific basis and health benefits of this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

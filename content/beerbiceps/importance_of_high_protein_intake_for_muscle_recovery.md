One of the top ways to reduce [[understanding_muscle_soreness_after_weight_training | muscle soreness]] and facilitate recovery after a workout is to maintain a high protein intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>.

## Protein: The Building Block of Life
Protein is often called the "building block of life" because every cell in the human body is made from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>. When muscles are damaged during a workout, such as through the micro-tears that occur during exercises like bicep curls, the body intelligently prepares for future exertion by becoming stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>.

## Muscle Repair and Growth
During the recovery phase, the body replaces broken-down muscle fibers with stronger ones that can better withstand force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>. A consistent supply of protein acts as a steady fuel source for these damaged muscles, enabling them to build stronger muscles for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a>.

## Benefits of High Protein Intake
The higher your protein intake, the better your overall recovery will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. Improved recovery directly translates to better "gains" and increased muscle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>.

The journey of career choices, particularly for those venturing into unconventional paths, is deeply influenced by personal ambition, familial support, and a unique definition of success that often transcends monetary gain. The Chanchlani family, with children Ashish and Muskan, exemplifies a household where humility, hard work, and the pursuit of passion have paved the way for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Upholding Humility and Values

Ashish and Muskan are noted for their humility and ability to treat everyone with respect, regardless of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Their parents instilled in them the value of interacting with everyone, from cooks to watchmen, with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This upbringing fostered a positive outlook, where they appreciate the hard work of others rather than feeling jealous of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The family believes that true success isn't measured by numbers or wealth, but by maintaining humility and staying grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Passion

Ashish's journey illustrates the importance of following one's passion. His father recalls that Ashish never wanted to rely on his family's wealth; instead, he desired to be independent and create his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Despite being from a wealthy background, Ashish was shaped by early experiences, such as taking local transport and working in the family's multiplexes from the age of 16-17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This hands-on experience, including handling banking and suggesting technological upgrades like 3D and 7.1 Dolby sound for the multiplexes, demonstrated his [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | ambition]] and [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | hard work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Ashish began his vine channel as a "passion project," not with the intention of earning money immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. His long-standing desire to act led him to create content, which he found personally fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This deep interest in cinema, particularly in making massy, comedic content in the style of Rohit Shetty, stemmed from his love for movies and his desire for audiences to forget their problems and simply enjoy his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This level of dedication, bordering on obsession, is seen as crucial for those starting their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Parental Support for Unconventional Paths

A significant aspect of Ashish and Muskan's success lies in their parents' [[parental_perceptions_of_unconventional_career_paths | supportive approach]] to their unconventional career choices. Ashish's mother initially expressed doubt about his video-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, upon seeing his work and the positive reception, she became supportive, providing him with what he needed and even reviewing his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

When Ashish decided to pursue acting and felt he couldn't continue with engineering, his father advised him to balance his passion with education, urging him to finish his studies rather than leaving midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This highlights a balanced perspective on career choices, where passion is encouraged, but practical aspects like education are not neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The mother's advice to other parents regarding children pursuing unconventional careers is to:
*   Allow the child to pursue their desired path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Give them at least a year to try it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   Support them if they show success, even at a later age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   "Don't stop him, don't restrict him in anything, let him fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Avoid tying children down with too many restrictions, as it can lead to confusion about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Defining Success Beyond Wealth

The family's philosophy emphasizes that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Ashish's father often exposed him to film stars, teaching him that fame is fleeting and dependent on success. For example, Aamir Khan was "abused" after the flop of "Mela" but revered after the hit "Dhoom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This instilled in Ashish the understanding that "success is more important than money" and that the "hunger for success makes you humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

Ashish and Muskan credit their parents for teaching them core values:
*   **Humility and bonding:** Muskan learned the importance of treating everyone equally and forming bonds with people from her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Independence and self-identity:** Ashish learned from his father the importance of creating his own identity, rather than relying on his family's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Optimism and perseverance:** Muskan also highlights her mother's consistent positivity and belief that "something good comes out of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Never giving up and loving everyone:** Ashish emphasizes the lesson from his father to "never give up" and always treat others with respect and love, regardless of how they treat you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

These lessons highlight the core belief that [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | discipline]], [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | hard work]], and a positive outlook are fundamental to navigating career choices and achieving lasting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

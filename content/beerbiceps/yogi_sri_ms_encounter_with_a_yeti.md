Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader, is often associated with discussions about yetis due to an experience he recounted in his autobiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. This encounter took place during an attempted journey to Kailash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

## The Journey to Kailash
At the age of 19, Shri M embarked on a spiritual journey to the Himalayas, driven by a desire for a tangible spiritual experience and a recurring thought that a teacher awaited him in the snow-clad mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. After meeting his Guru, [[yoga_maya_and_her_role | Maheswar Babaji]], and training with him for three and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>, they attempted to go to Kailash via an unconventional, now unused route through the Indo-Tibetan border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

During this journey, Shri M developed a high fever, becoming delirious with a rising temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. They stopped for the night in a village that housed a massive Tibetan Buddha statue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

## The Encounter
While sleeping in a tent, Shri M awoke to find his temperature had dropped, feeling slightly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. In the dim light of a kerosene lantern, he noticed a "huge person standing there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. His initial thought was that it was a bear, but it was standing like a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. He described it as a "furry kind of person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a> with a face broader and bigger than a human face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>.

The being approached him, making an eerie, whistling sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. It then stuffed a bitter herbal medicine into his mouth, which Shri M swallowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. The creature then ran off just as his Guru, Babaji, came into the tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>. Shri M was scared, unable to scream due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>, and noted a furry animal-like smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

## Aftermath and Broader Implications
Babaji later explained that the being was a yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>, stating that Shri M would have died from the mountain fever had it not intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. He characterized yetis as "good people" who are not to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

This experience led Shri M to understand that such living creatures exist in the remote parts of mountains, caves, and forests, even if people don't often see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. He emphasized that people underestimate the vastness of mountains and forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

Shri M believes in the existence of [[yakinis_and_paranormal_entities | higher beings]] and other dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. He notes that while "ghosts" are often products of imagination or residual electrical charges from sudden deaths, without their own intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:04">[03:08:04]</a>, other beings, not necessarily demonic, can sometimes occupy physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>. These beings, both good and bad, exist in different vibrational frequencies and can influence human thoughts and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:09">[04:17:09]</a>.

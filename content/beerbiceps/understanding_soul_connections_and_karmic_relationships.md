## The Influence of Karma and Destiny
The speaker explains that what appears as unfairness in life, where some people work extremely hard but don't achieve success while others effortlessly gain it, is a manifestation of [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. What is visible as "hard work" in this lifetime is current [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]], but unseen past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmas]] from previous "costumes" (lifetimes) also determine present success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Essentially, nothing in this world is unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Life stories are considered [[karma_and_predestined_life_paths | pre-decided]] not by an external force, but by the soul's own past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Every outcome, whether success or challenges, is a consequence of the [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] the soul has chosen to create across its journey of lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Thus, [[the_role_of_karma_free_will_and_destiny_in_spiritual_life | Karma and destiny walk hand-in-hand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### The Soul's Journey and Sanskars
The soul is like a battery, with its charge reflecting its state of divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Through different ages (Golden, Silver, Copper, Iron), the soul's charge depletes as it takes on more bodies and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Emotional patterns and innate nature, known as "sanskar," are carried by the soul from one lifetime to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Sanskar isn't just personality or body language; it encompasses emotional patterns like anger, criticism, appreciation, doubt, trust, stability, or reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Babies, even twins born on the same day, display different sanskars (e.g., one smiling, one grumpy) from birth, indicating these are carried from previous "costumes" or lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

> "The soul in the previous costume, if they were light happy smiling, they're just going to carry that suncar body changed and the other so little grumpy because that's how the soul was in the previous costume so we are starting this birth with our Karma and ssars and now the present Karma." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>

## Understanding Karmic Relationships
All close relationships—friends, parents, siblings, romantic partners—are part of a "close karmic account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. We have met these souls before in previous interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. The present relationship is influenced by the quality of past interactions, which can be harmonious or bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

*   If past interactions were bitter and no effort was made to heal the energy, the relationship will continue to get tougher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   Souls with strong karmic accounts will keep meeting until the account is sorted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   Good relationships should be made even better, while uncomfortable ones should be sorted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

The concept of "twin flames" is seen as a close karmic connection, where two souls meet and feel an intense connection, indicating they were "meant to meet" at that point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. However, this applies to all significant relationships, not just romantic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

## Changing Your Karma and Destiny
While the outcome of past negative [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] will still manifest, one's approach to facing it can change through spiritual practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Meditation, for instance, creates a shift in personality and how one responds to life's situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This means that while a consequence will come, it won't necessarily lead to suffering because the present [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | Karma]] quality has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Meditation cleanses the soul, helping it face past [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] consequences without suffering and create positive [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

Spiritual progress is not solely defined by deep meditation experiences, but by how one's feelings change during daily activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. The goal is to be a "Karam Yogi," meaning one practices meditation in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

> "Spiritual progress will be determined by how my feelings are now changing while I'm in activity not only while in meditation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>

This "spiritual stamina" allows one to genuinely be kind even to those who are not kind in return, thereby settling past karmic accounts and creating new positive [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

## Astrology and Free Will
Astrological charts, prepared shortly after birth, represent the soul's "opening balance sheet" of [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmas]] and sanskars from previous lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. These charts predict future events based on these inherited patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

Astrology is the science of planetary influence on one's sanskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand that these charts are a "probability manual," not a "reality manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. By changing one's present [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | Karma]] and lifestyle, especially through meditation which melts negative sanskars, the soul can alter its destiny and defy astrological predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

> "If I change my lifestyle tomorrow so the astrological prediction is only a prediction so the word prediction needs to be underlined it's only a prediction which means it's a probability reality will be decided by the individual." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>

This highlights the power of free will and conscious action in shaping one's life, rather than being a victim of predetermined fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Relationships, Life's Purpose, and the Divine
Marriage, like other relationships, is a choice influenced by the soul's karmic patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Even predictions of divorce can be changed if individuals actively work on their present [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | Karma]] within the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

Spirituality isn't about abandoning one's roles, responsibilities, or activities; it's about transforming the *way* one engages with life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. It's about living a "meditative way of doing your [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. The aim is to cultivate inner peace and radiate positive energy, rather than seeking happiness from external achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

### Divine Feminine and Soul Consciousness
The concept of "divine feminine" or male/female divine entities (like Shiv and Shakti) is symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. It represents the Supreme Soul (Shiv) and the individual soul's innate power (Shakti), not gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. The eight arms of deities symbolize the "Eight Powers of the Soul" (e.g., power to withdraw, discern, adjust, cooperate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. True "Shakti" is the power within the soul, which should be invoked and embodied, not sought externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

The path to spiritual understanding involves transcending the "body consciousness" (identity based on gender, profession, religion, etc.) and living from "soul consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. The soul has no gender; it has experienced both male and female bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. Societal conditioning shapes how sanskars are expressed, but the sanskars themselves belong to the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

## Cycles of Time and the Purpose of Existence
[[Insights on life death and rebirth in spiritual philosophy | The world operates in a cyclic manner]], much like seasons or a 24-hour day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This "World Cycle" includes the Golden, Silver, Copper, and Iron Ages (Satyug, Treta Yug, Dwapar Yug, Kali Yug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. We are currently at the peak of the Iron Age (Kali Yug), which is also the "cusp" of transition back to the Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This transition is characterized by societal decline, destruction, and lower vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Simultaneously, it's a time of awakening, where some souls begin to raise their vibration through practices like meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When one soul raises its energy, it radiates that positive vibration into the collective energy of the planet, contributing to a global shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. A "tipping point" of a small number of awakened souls can overpower lower vibrational energy and shift the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

The ultimate purpose of human existence is to remember one's true identity as a soul, connected to a Divine Parent, and return to the "soul world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. The increasing human population indicates that souls are continuously coming from the soul world into physical embodiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. Physical travel to planets like Mars is limited to the physical realm; the soul travels to the "soul world," which is beyond the visible universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.

The universe and space serve as a reminder that the world extends far beyond our immediate understanding, prompting us to "look up and go beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The shift into the Golden Age will involve a "big shift" where souls return home and then come back down to the planet based on their vibrational frequency, restarting the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. Individuals working on their sanskars and vibration are instrumental in constructing this "new house," the new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>.

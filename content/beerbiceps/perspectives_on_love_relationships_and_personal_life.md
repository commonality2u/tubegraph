Nora Fatehi, a prominent figure in the Indian film industry, shares her profound insights on love, gender roles, societal expectations, and personal well-being, drawn from her unique life experiences and spiritual beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

## Belief in Love and Marriage
Fatehi expresses a strong belief in love, stating that "of course I do" when asked if she believes in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. She finds it deplorable to marry someone without love and live with them for years, noting that "nothing is worse than getting married to someone that you don't even love and living with them for years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. She observes that many in her industry engage in such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. For Fatehi, marrying for "clout," networking, money, or relevancy is a predatory act, especially since the other person may be unaware of these underlying motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. She emphasizes that personal life and mental health should not be sacrificed for work, as mixing the two leads to unhappiness, depression, and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Gender Dynamics and Feminism
Fatehi holds strong views on the traditional roles of men and women in society and relationships. She believes that both men and women "need each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

### Critiques of Radical Feminism
Fatehi states that she does not believe in the idea of not needing anyone or radical feminism, asserting that feminism has "f***ed up our society completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. She argues that the concept of being completely independent, not marrying, or having children, and dismissing traditional male and female dynamics is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
*   **Traditional Roles**: Fatehi advocates for traditional roles, where the man is a provider and breadwinner, and the woman is a nurturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. She believes women should be ready to take on the roles of mother and wife, while men should be ready to be providers, breadwinners, and fathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. She considers this the "normal way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Societal Impact**: She explains that the focus on "freedom and liberation" and "everyone's equal" has, in her view, destroyed the family unit and the feminine energy of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. This radicalization of feminism has led to families suffering, children suffering, and women's mental health suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.
*   **Physiological Differences**: The host introduces a perspective on female physiology, noting that it was not designed for the traditional 8-to-5 grind, which accommodates men's daily hormonal cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Women's hormones operate on a 28-day cycle with different patterns daily, needing more sleep, creativity, and schedule variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Fatehi strongly agrees with this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

### The "Right Man" and Feminine Energy
Fatehi believes the "right man" can unlock a woman's true feminine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. She acknowledges her own masculine traits, developed due to being in "survival mode" and being the family's breadwinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. With a man who is a provider, supporter, and protector, she would "automatically surrender and feel safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. She argues that society has led to men losing their masculine energy, which is a problem for women seeking men with this energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

## Personal Sacrifices and Career
Fatehi describes herself as a workaholic, constantly running towards her goals, which include securing lead roles in films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Her journey has been a "10-year struggle," climbing "stairs" rather than taking the "lift" or "escalator" like some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### Balancing Aspirations
She aims to balance her work in India and internationally, often feeling the need to "split myself in half and be in one two different places at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. She is currently working towards a global career after signing a record deal with Warner America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

### Sacrifices and Missed Moments
Fatehi reflects on the extensive sacrifices she has made for her career, including missing significant family moments like her brother's wedding, the birth of his sons, and her friends' marriages and childbirths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. She has missed "everything in the span of 10 years chasing my dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. She acknowledges that this level of ambition requires "full undivided attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

## Navigating Relationships and Trust
Fatehi openly discusses the challenges of trust and dealing with "predators" in her personal and professional life.

### Identifying Predators
She describes "predators" as individuals, whether stars or not, who "sniff out victims" and use their position to "bait you into work and to make you submissive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. These can be sexual predators or "clout predators" who use others for fame and relevancy, even in marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

Fatehi has a "radar" for identifying such individuals, developed through life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. She can often tell from their gaze, body language, and manner of speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Her intimidating personality has often protected her from direct predatory advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Personal Experience and Protection
Fatehi recounts a "terrible experience" with someone that was "way worse" than just being cheated on, leading her to build a strong barrier around herself to protect her "aura" and "spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>. She prefers to "stay alone" because she needs to "filter everyone and know what everyone's intention is before I allow them in my vicinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. She is currently single and learning how to let her walls down and "screen people more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

### Perceptions of Women
Fatehi challenges the assumption that girls are "really sweet," stating, "girls are not sweet, whoever told you that don't be naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. She believes "a lot of women are crazy, a lot of women are conniving, a lot of them are great actors in real life" and will manipulate situations and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. This perspective highlights the complexities of [[crosscultural_relationships_and_perspectives_on_dating]] and [[navigating_marriage_and_relationships]].

## Spirituality and Self-Protection
Fatehi places significant importance on spirituality, particularly the concept of Nazar (evil eye), and the protective power of prayer.

### Nazar (Evil Eye)
Nazar is described as the negative energy, envy, hate, and jealousy from others that can affect a person, especially those in the public eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Effects of Nazar**: Fatehi explains that Nazar can make a person sick, mentally disturbed, lose sleep, or cause physical pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. It can also "kill your aura" making one look less vibrant, and contribute to depression and anxiety among stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. She believes "most people know" when they are putting Nazar on someone, even if unintentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
*   **Protection from Nazar**: Fatehi shares methods of protection, including saltwater baths, mantras, meditation, and reading Quran and praying for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of protecting one's aura and spirit in the competitive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. She confirms that Nazar can be put on someone digitally, as eyes are seen as the "gate of your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

### The Power of Prayer and Intuition
Fatehi regularly fasts and prays, viewing prayer as a powerful form of meditation and a "survival skills shield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. She believes prayer helps one stay "more in tune to my intuition" and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:43">[01:39:43]</a>. It provides connection with the creator, offering protection, forgiveness, and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. This deep connection to spiritual practices is a key aspect of her [[relationships_and_personal_growth]].

## Self-Perception and Growth
Fatehi reflects on her personal journey and how her experiences have shaped her.

### Childhood and Fame
From a young age, Fatehi desired fame, even at three years old, demanding attention and crying if she didn't get applause while dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. She sees this as a deep-seated desire for validation and admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

### Mental Processing and Trauma
Fatehi acknowledges her brain is constantly focused on "what's next" for her career, leaving little time for "empty thoughts" or processing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. This constant drive, combined with the lack of emotional processing, sometimes makes her realize she "might need therapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. She believes chasing fame often stems from trauma or being born into a fame-oriented environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This relates to [[perception_of_personal_flaws_and_selfacceptance]] and the broader journey of [[relationships_and_personal_growth]].

### Openness and Authenticity
Despite the "cancel culture era," Fatehi chooses to be open and unfiltered in podcasts, wanting people to know "who I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. She finds it frustrating that people talk about her constantly without considering her feelings or mental health, often spreading lies on platforms like Reddit and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. She believes her directness and intimidating personality may contribute to others disliking her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. She challenges critics to "explain the numbers" of her success, including billions of views and millions of followers, if she is as untalented or manipulative as rumored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Conclusion
Fatehi's perspectives offer a candid look into the demands of a public life, the intricate dynamics of [[relationships_and_personal_growth]], and the profound influence of spiritual beliefs and personal strength in navigating a complex world. She encourages listeners to be open-minded, sensitive, and to not judge others based on stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07">[01:51:07]</a>.

Robert Kiyosaki, author of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, emphasizes the critical role of financial education in personal prosperity and highlights the stark difference between "fake money" and "real money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. His work has significantly influenced many individuals' [[valuing_experiences_and_personal_growth | personal finance journeys]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Education
Kiyosaki points out that traditional schooling, despite its academic focus, fails to teach anything about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. He recounts how his "poor dad," a highly educated individual with a PhD and a background as a school principal and college professor, repeated the Christian adage that "the love of money is the root of all evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This contrasts with Kiyosaki's observations of rich kids, leading him to question the conventional wisdom that staying in school guarantees wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>. He asserts that the statement "if you stay in school you'll be rich" is a "lie told to our kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

Kiyosaki claims that school teachers, whom he refers to as "the biggest criminals in the world," often operate with a Marxist or communist [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | mindset]], teaching people to work for "fake money" instead of understanding how to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. He openly challenges the education system, famously stating in one of his books that if you want to be rich, "don't go to school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## "Fake Money" vs. "Real Money"
A central theme in Kiyosaki's philosophy is the distinction between "fake money" and "real money":
*   **Fake Money:** Refers to fiat currencies like the US dollar, rupee, or peso, which he calls "toilet paper" because they are not backed by tangible assets and are prone to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. He argues that working for fake money causes poverty because its value diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Real Money:** This includes physical assets such as gold and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. He advocates for investing in silver as "the best investment in the world today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, affordable to many at around $35 US per ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Investment Advice
Kiyosaki advises against working for "fake money" or jobs, instead advocating for working to acquire assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. His personal investments include:
*   Real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>
*   Bitcoin (due to its blockchain integrity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>
*   Cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>
*   Oil wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>

He warns that with advancements like AI, many jobs will disappear, making it crucial to understand asset-based wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

## Capitalism vs. Other Economic Systems
Kiyosaki is a staunch capitalist, contrasting himself with figures he identifies as communists or socialists, such as his "poor dad" and President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. He views socialism as a system where "people believe in giving people money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. In contrast, capitalism allows individuals to "earn and multiply money in order to earn mental freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. He uses the example of President Biden cutting the Canada-Gulf of Mexico oil pipeline, which caused oil prices to skyrocket from $30 to $130 a barrel, as an intentional act to "destroy the middle class" and create only two classes: the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Integrity and Personal Responsibility in Finance
Kiyosaki defines integrity as being "whole" – where one's body, mind, words, heart, and actions are one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. He asserts that schools lack integrity by not teaching about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. He lives by the principles of being legal, ethical, and moral in his financial dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.

While money is not the ultimate goal of life, Kiyosaki views it as an enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. His goal is to do good in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a> and fight for the freedom of people through [[the_role_of_education_and_discipline_in_personal_development | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. He sees his current work as a fight with the same intensity he had as a pilot in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. His military background instilled in him [[the_role_of_education_and_discipline_in_personal_development | discipline]] – the ability to "do what I have to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. He values observing what people *do* rather than what they *say*, as it reflects their true integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

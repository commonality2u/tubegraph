Their story highlights the importance of instilling core values, providing unwavering support, and teaching vital life [[lessons_learned_from_family_and_relationships | lessons]].

## Instilling Core Values

The Chanchlani parents emphasized humility and kindness from an early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Both Ashish and Muskan are described as "very humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and are known for treating everyone, including household staff like cooks and watchmen, with respect and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This commitment to [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | humility]] is seen as their greatest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> "Success doesn't mean numbers but I think true success is this sticking to humility after no hassle one should always be down to earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

A core belief instilled since childhood was that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, and that "the hunger for success makes you humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This focus helped them navigate potential pitfalls, especially common among "rich kids" who might be sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Parental Support and Guidance

The parents played a crucial role in shaping their children's paths:

*   **Early Work Experience and Independence**: Ashish's father ensured he gained practical experience from a young age, working with him in multiplexes from 16-17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This exposure to business and responsibility contributed significantly to his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Despite coming from a wealthy background, Ashish's father encouraged him to create his own identity and earn independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Balancing Passion with Education**: When Ashish wanted to pursue acting instead of engineering, his father encouraged him to pursue both simultaneously, emphasizing the importance of completing his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This pragmatic approach highlights the value of education alongside passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Reviewing and Encouraging Creative Work**: Ashish's mother initially didn't understand his vine videos but later became a reviewer, providing feedback and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Her support provided whatever he needed to pursue his ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Lessons from Parental Experience

The parents' own experiences and observations informed their guidance:

*   **Business Acumen**: Ashish's father, a businessman himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, instilled valuable [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | business skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He recognized Ashish's keen understanding of audience preferences in India, especially for massy, comedy content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Humility Amidst Fame**: Having witnessed the fluctuating fame of film stars like Aamir Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, Ashish's father taught him that fame is fleeting and tied to success, not just name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This observation reinforced the idea that success is paramount and leads to humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Importance of Discipline and Health**: The father's final advice to his children was to "love what you say," "take care of your health," and "try to live a disciplined life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Children's Perspective on Parental Influence

Ashish and Muskan reflect on their parents' impact:

*   Muskan credits her mother with teaching her humility and bonding with everyone equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Ashish highlights his father's [[the_impact_of_childhood_experiences_on_adulthood | influence]] in developing business skills and the drive to create his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He consciously chose not to "show off" his family's wealth, opting to be independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Both emphasize lessons of positivity from their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> and perseverance ("never give up") and unconditional love and respect for others from their father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Advice for Parents

Ashish's mother offers advice to other parents who may be nervous about their children's career choices:

> "Whatever the child wants to do, first let him do it, first see to it at least give him one year at least if he is able to do it for one year then see to it how successful he is in that whether he becomes successful even at 50 then let him move on don't stop him don't restrict him in anything let him fly as our child grows up like a bird eventually he will say I want to fly he should be allowed to fly actually one should not be tied down too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>

She believes that over-restriction can lead to confusion in children's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This highlights a common [[family_life_and_parenting_challenges | parenting challenge]] and offers a path to encouraging children's self-discovery and confidence.

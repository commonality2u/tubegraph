Dr. S. Jaishankar, India's Minister of External Affairs, emphasizes the critical role of [[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] in the daily lives of every Indian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He highlights that foreign policy is not merely an academic exercise but directly impacts individuals through securing travelers abroad, assisting students with issues, and addressing visa challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The Minister states that the goal is to make foreign policy personally beneficial for every Indian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship and National Competitiveness

Dr. Jaishankar asserts that at the core of [[indias_global_economic_strategy_and_entrepreneurship | India's global strategy]] is the concept of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. He notes that if India lacks factories, entrepreneurship, businesses, startups, robust agriculture, and infrastructure, it risks being outpaced by not only China but also the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The world is seen as a competitive arena where nations, even friends like the US and Europe, constantly vie with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Smaller economies like Vietnam also compete in specific sectors, such as investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

The Minister's message to young people is that success today is about building strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Initiatives like 'Make in India', 'Startup India', and 'Gati Shakti' are crucial, as no one will manufacture in India if the infrastructure is poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The nation needs smart ports, good roads, and rapid movement of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The ultimate goal is to create jobs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, with [[indias_foreign_policy_and_its_relationship_with_the_us_and_china | foreign policy]] playing a role in marketing and branding India as a responsible and trustworthy magnet for global business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This requires chasing excellence individually to achieve national excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## The Global Workplace and Talent Mobility

Under [[modi_governments_policies | Prime Minister Modi]], India's perspective has shifted to viewing the world as a global workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, where work opportunities exist anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. The role of foreign policy is to open doors for talented Indians, ensuring they are not restricted by borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

In the current era of technology competition and "Chip Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, there is a high demand for "trusted talent" â€“ individuals who adhere to rules and understand international business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. People under 35 are particularly in demand globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. India has been actively pursuing mobility agreements with countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and the US to facilitate these talent flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

Dr. Jaishankar reframes the "brain drain" issue as a dynamic "membrane" where people move in and out of India for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. The traditional idea of committing one's entire life to a single job or location is changing, with more short-term engagements and fluid movement becoming common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. He predicts that many will realize that opportunities in India can often be better than those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

The Minister cites Apple's increasing presence in India as validation of an improved business atmosphere and a testament to the quality of Indian talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. He also notes that large Indian companies are now more inclined to invest domestically rather than hedging by going abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

> "Today it is all about building strengths that when you say make an India when you say startup India when you say GTI shaki you know you need nobody's going to manufacture in India if you're infrastructure is lousy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>

## The Role of Technology and Data in [[diplomacy_and_international_competitiveness | Diplomacy]]

Dr. Jaishankar sees Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the processing of "electronic patterns" as a significant future development in geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. He explains that humans constantly emit electronic patterns through their digital activities (downloads, communication, purchases, consumption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. AI's ability to "mega process" these patterns offers a substantial advantage, akin to a cricketer having complete data on every opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. He believes AI assistants will become commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

Currently, semiconductors and the "Chip War" are a more immediate focus than quantum computing in geopolitical conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. The strategy revolves around preparing for an era where chips are the "new oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This involves international cooperation to ensure trusted collaboration and supply chains among "like-minded" market economies and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Message to Young India

Dr. Jaishankar encourages young Indians to have self-belief in this new era of opportunities and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. He stresses the interconnectedness of national and personal choices:

> "A good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>

He also highlights the unique nature of [[indias_political_landscape | India's media landscape]], where various mediums coexist, allowing the government to reach different generations and audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. He acknowledges that leadership can emerge from young individuals and that Prime Minister Modi's status as a "Youth Icon" is a testament to this evolving dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

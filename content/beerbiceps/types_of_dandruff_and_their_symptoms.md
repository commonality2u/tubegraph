The first kind of dandruff is characterized by white flakes that simply fall off your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While many [[choosing_the_right_shampoo_for_hair_health | anti-dandruff shampoo]] companies might suggest it's a significant issue, this type of dandruff is generally not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Seborrheic Dermatitis

The second, more severe kind of dandruff is called seborrheic dermatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. With this condition, the white flakes are accompanied by severe itching in the scalp region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The itching can also extend to areas around the hairline, including the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Other symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis include:
*   Boils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Rashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

It is strongly advised that if you are suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, you should consult a dermatologist rather than relying on home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

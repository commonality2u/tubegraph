Studying is often perceived as a boring process that demands significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. No student genuinely enjoys the act of studying; most would prefer to relax, watch television, or play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, studying is a constant in life that cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. What *can* be changed is your [[changing_perspective_towards_studying | perspective towards studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Studying as a Boxing Match

Instead of viewing studying as a tedious chore, consider it a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Muhammad Ali, a legendary boxer, famously stated that he "hated every single minute of training" but told himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This mindset applies directly to studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### The True Opponent: Yourself

While Muhammad Ali trained to face the greatest heavyweight boxers, your primary opponent in studying for exams, and in life, is yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The person you see in the mirror is your biggest adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Students who excel in exams dislike studying as much as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, but they are not inherently smarter or more talented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Hunger for Success

The differentiating factor is a [[exam_motivation_and_hunger_for_success | hunger for success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. If you are seeking [[exam_motivation_and_hunger_for_success | exam motivation]], you should cultivate this internal hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Rather than being an average student, train to prepare yourself for a championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Studying for Your Future Self

Your motivation for studying should be singular: your [[selfmotivation_for_future_goals | future version of yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Do not study to impress parents, friends, or to gain marks or monetary rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The goal is to reach a position where you are confident in your abilities, having trained so diligently that you know every answer on an exam paper and can perform like a champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Choosing the Harder Path

When faced with the option to skip parts of your study material or questions, always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Discipline is the choice between what you desire immediately and what you desire most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. In moments of laziness, when you have the option to give less than 100%, choose instead to give 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Cultivate [[selfmotivation_and_confidence_building | self-motivation]] and effort from deep within yourself, not for external validation, but solely for your own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Ultimately, you have the choice: be remembered as someone who lost battles against yourself or as the greatest when it comes to studying and working towards your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The rule of life is "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

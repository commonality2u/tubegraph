[[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] is described as an expert strategizer, using the [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Pandavas]] and [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Kauravas]] as a pretext to cleanse the Earth of unrighteous kings [00:00:34].

## Krishna's Purpose and Role

[[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]]'s arrival was for two main purposes: to bless the Gopi janas (gopas and gopies) who had awaited him for lifetimes, and to clear the Earth of adharmic forces [01:40:44, 01:48:21, 01:48:35]. The Earth (Bhumi) appeared to him as a cow, lamenting the heavy burden of adharmic kings [01:48:32].

One significant aspect of [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]]'s role is highlighted through the story of Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha [01:43:53]. When they were cursed to be born on Earth, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] offered them a choice: seven long lives as devotees or three quick lives as enemies [01:45:40]. They chose the latter, leading to their incarnations as Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu, then [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ravana]] and Kumbhakarna, and finally Shishupala and Dantavakra, all of whom were ultimately defeated by [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Vishnu]]'s avatars [01:45:57]. This demonstrates that anyone who comes into contact with [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] achieves liberation (Moksha), regardless of their relationship (love or hate) [01:46:57, 01:50:00].

## The Bhagavad Gita and Divine Expression

In the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] War, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] takes on the role of a charioteer (sarthi) and a witness, not taking up arms himself [01:41:14, 01:49:14, 01:49:21]. This period, especially during the Kurukshetra War, is characterized by his "Aishwarya Leelas," where he openly displays his divinity [01:40:53, 01:41:55].

The ultimate expression of his divinity in the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] comes in the Bhagavad Gita, the "song of the Lord" [01:58:39, 01:58:40]. It consists of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas, declared by [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] as all that is needed for life [02:10:14, 02:10:17].

## Key Events and Krishna's Guidance

After slaying Kamsa and re-establishing Ugrasena as the king of Mathura, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]]'s "Madura Leelas" in Vrindavan transition to "Aishwarya Leelas" [01:40:18, 01:40:40, 01:40:51]. His involvement with the [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Pandavas]] begins as he comes to their rescue and becomes their trusted mentor and counsel, advising them on strategy [01:41:30, 01:41:44].

### The Kurukshetra War

The [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] War was instigated by [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] to completely destroy (samula) all forces that did not practice Dharma [01:48:58, 01:49:03]. He orchestrated the conflict, pitting the [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Pandavas]] against the [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Kauravas]] [01:49:10].

### Karma and Justice

[[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] serves as the universe's "conscience keeper" (karma sakshi) [01:53:38]. He ensures that actions, whether Dharmic or Adharmic, lead to their appropriate outcomes. For instance, he clearly explains to Karna, a key figure in the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]], that his negative nature led him to be placed on Duryodhana's side, and his actions (like supporting Draupadi's disrobing) justified his undharmic end [01:53:10, 01:53:38, 01:53:40, 01:54:57, 01:55:00]. When Karna's chariot wheel got stuck in the mud, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] instructed Arjuna to strike, rebuking Karna's sudden appeal to Dharma by citing his past adharmic actions [01:54:40, 01:54:53].

Similarly, during the war, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] strategically advised Yudhisthira to declare that Ashwatthama was dead, knowing it would demoralize Dronacharya [01:57:23, 01:57:26]. When Yudhisthira whispered "elephant" (Aswathama the elephant), [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] sternly questioned his deviation, emphasizing that the true path of Dharma sometimes requires difficult actions for a greater purpose [01:57:55, 01:58:09].

## Krishna's Life Post-[[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] War

Little is commonly known about the 36 years after the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] War [01:00:00]. This period is detailed in the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharatam]] itself [01:01:03].

At the end of the 18-day war, Gandhari, mother of the [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Kauravas]], witnessed the gruesome battlefield [02:03:26, 02:03:40]. Overcome by grief for her deceased sons, she cursed [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]], prophesying that he would die silently by a hunter's arrow [02:04:49, 02:05:44]. [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] accepted the curse with a smile, revealing that his departure was predestined and her accumulated spiritual merit (Tapas) was wasted on cursing him [02:06:07, 02:06:14, 02:07:47].

After the war, [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] went to Dwarka and witnessed the destruction of his own [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Yadava clan]] due to their internal bickering and misdeeds, which was partly an extension of Gandhari's curse and their destined fate [02:07:49, 02:08:16]. He then retired to a forest in Dwarka, sitting at the base of a tree with one foot outstretched [02:08:21, 02:08:29]. A hunter, mistaking his foot for a deer's ear, shot him with a poisoned arrow [02:08:44, 02:08:50]. The poison spread, and [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] returned to his eternal abode, Goloka [02:08:56, 02:09:02]. Before his departure, he instructed [[significance_and_mythology_of_yadava_and_pandava_clans | Balarama]], his brother, to return to Adishesha, preparing the cosmic bed for the Lord's recline [02:09:04, 02:09:12]. This marked the fulfillment of his avataric purpose [02:09:43, 02:09:54].

## Connecting Krishna's Avatar to Other Cycles

The speaker highlights that the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharat_and_its_historical_dating | dating of the Mahabharata]] (around 5561 BC) and [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] (around 12,000 BC), as suggested by researchers like N. Oak and Rupa Bhaty, imply a significant gap between the two epics [02:33:36, 02:40:02]. This supports the idea that [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Rama]] and [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]] did not come in the same cycle of Yugas, but in subsequent ones [02:55:09, 02:55:17].

<p>A beautiful story from the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] illustrates the timelessness of [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Vishnu]]'s avatars. Rama asks Hanuman to retrieve his ring from Brahmadeva. Upon reaching Brahmaloka, Hanuman finds a pond filled with countless identical rings, representing the many times Rama's avatar has manifested across different Yugas [02:29:19, 02:29:41, 02:29:52, 02:31:16]. This suggests that the given dates for the epics refer to specific manifestations within these endless cycles of time [02:32:09, 02:33:04, 02:33:09, 02:33:17, 02:33:31].</p>

For those seeking a quick connection with [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]], simply chanting his name, or even better, chanting [[the_role_of_radha_in_krishnas_life | Radha]]'s name ("Radha Radha Radha Ram Radha Krishna"), is immensely powerful [01:28:36, 01:28:40, 01:30:08]. In Vrindavan, people greet each other with "Radhe Radhe" as an act of love for [[krishnas_life_and_teachings | Krishna]], a practice that changes the way one speaks and thinks [01:30:03, 01:30:19, 01:30:21].

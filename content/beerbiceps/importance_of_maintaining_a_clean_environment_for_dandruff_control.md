Maintaining a clean environment is crucial for effective dandruff control, as dandruff is considered an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Even with the use of anti-[[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]] products, [[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]] can persist if the surrounding environment remains "dandruff infested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Why Environmental Cleanliness Matters

[[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | Dandruff]] is formed when an oily scalp leads to dead skin cells collecting and mixing with oil, forming white flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To prevent recurring [[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]], it is essential to cleanse items that frequently come into contact with the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Cleaning Personal Items

To effectively manage [[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]], various personal items should be regularly cleaned:

*   **Pillowcases** It is important to clean pillowcases, as they can harbor [[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]]-causing agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. To clean a pillowcase, remove it from the pillow, dip it in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water), and leave it immersed for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes** Similar to pillowcases, combs and brushes that are regularly used on the hair should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear** All types of headgear, including caps, hats, and helmets, should be cleaned regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hair Accessories** Any hair bands or hair clips that come into contact with the scalp should also be subjected to the same cleaning regimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In general, anything that touches the scalp should be washed to prevent the re-infestation of [[understanding_different_types_of_dandruff | dandruff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

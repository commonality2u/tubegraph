From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Nilesh Oak's work focuses on the realistic aspects and dating of the [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | Mahabharat and Ramayan]], offering a scientific approach to understanding the culture and history of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. He aims to dispel the [[perception_of_indian_epics_as_mythology_vs_history | misconception that India lacks historical records and evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Oak states that there is "much more evidence" for figures like [[Shri Krishna]], who lived over 7,500 years ago, compared to global personalities known from less than 2,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Evidence for Historical Figures: A Comparison

When comparing various historical figures, such as Kalidas, Panini, Adi Shankara, Aryabhata, Bhaskara, Alexander, Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Julius Caesar, Seneca, and Jesus Christ, against Rama and [[Shri Krishna]], Oak asserts there is "zero archaeology evidence" for the former group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. In contrast, he claims "tremendous evidence" for [[Shri Krishna]], including both celestial and [[Archaeological findings related to Indian epics | archaeological evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Celestial evidence is considered more robust as it cannot be easily manipulated or hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## The Historicity and Biography of Shri Krishna

Nilesh Oak considers [[Shri Krishna]] a "sheet anchor" for tracing India's history backward and connecting it to world history, due to the extensive and complete information available about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Key Dates

*   **Mahabharat War:** 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This means the war occurred approximately 7,584 or 7,585 years ago from 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Krishna's Nirvana (Passing Away):** 36 years after the Mahabharat War, specifically in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. This was also when [[Shri Krishna]]'s city of Dwarka was flooded and destroyed by rising sea waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.
*   **Krishna Kills Kansa:** 5622 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.
*   **Krishna's Birth:** Based on the calculation that he was 11 years old when he killed Kansa, his birth year is 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. The birth took place on June 27/28, 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

Using these dates, [[Shri Krishna]] lived for approximately 107 or 108 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. This calculation aligns with a verse from Madhvacharya's *Mahabharat Tatparya Nirnaya*, which states [[Shri Krishna]] lived for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>. Arjun was believed to be the same age as Krishna, also living around 108 years, meaning they would have been in their early 70s during the Mahabharat War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31:00">[40:31:00]</a>. Bhishma, for instance, was over 140 years old when he fought in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:00">[40:56:00]</a>.

### Evidence from Texts and Science

The dating of these events is supported by celestial references found in texts like *Harivamsha* and *Bhagwat Purana*, which are appendices to the *Mahabharat* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:58:00">[37:58:00]</a>. These references include:
*   A comet covering 13 *nakshatras* (half the visible sky), making the moon's path indistinguishable, a rare event that has not happened for 10,000 years before or since this date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>.
*   Mercury being visible on the western horizon after sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.
*   A *nakshatra* being afflicted by a "Gor Planet" (e.g., Rahu, Ketu, Mars, Saturn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.
*   A total solar eclipse occurring during the daytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.
*   Mars (Angarak) in a specific "wakra" (oblique crossing) motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.

These events, occurring close together (within 15 days), are described by Kansa's minister as bad omens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. Modern astronomical software like Voyager 4.5 can simulate the sky at any historical date to validate these descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:50]</a>.

### Terrestrial Evidence

The texts also provide terrestrial evidence that matches the celestial observations. For example, the account of Vasudev carrying baby [[Shri Krishna]] from Mathura to Vrindavan describes dry conditions, with cut tree branches piled for agricultural burning and dry cow dung underfoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. This contradicts the popular narrative of heavy rain and the Yamuna river rising, as the month of Shravan (June/July) in the 6th millennium BCE was early summer, with no rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>. The current understanding of monsoon patterns indicates they have been stable for the last 30,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. The shift in the *rutu* (seasons) with respect to the Indian calendar months is due to the Earth's axis precession, which shifts by one month every 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>.

## Dwarka and its Ancient Origins

[[Shri Krishna]] relocated from Mathura to Dwarka (Devavati) on the west coast of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. This move was strategic, as Mathura's trade routes via the Yamuna and Ganga rivers were subject to tolls and attacks from Jarasandha's kingdom (Patna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:56:00">[58:56:00]</a>. Jarasandha defeated [[Shri Krishna]] and the Yadus 17 times, leading to the decision to move to Dwarka for uninterrupted trade and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:21:00">[59:21:00]</a>.

The actual Dwarka where [[Shri Krishna]] resided is located offshore from Somnath, as depicted by archaeological and historical work, including that of Graham Hancock and Glen Milne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This Dwarka was an island with multiple bridges to the mainland and was destroyed by rising sea levels in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. The current Dwarka temple is not the original Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

The site of Dwarka was originally known as Kusasthali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, established by King Raivata, a descendant of Sharyati, who was a son of Sash Manu. This lineage dates back approximately 30,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Archaeological findings of construction objects dated to about 30,000 years support this ancient presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Cross-Cultural Connections

The discussion also explores [[Crosscultural connections between ancient civilizations | cross-cultural connections]] between [[Ancient Hindu culture and its scientific aspects | ancient Indian texts]] and global histories:

*   **Greek Historians:** Megasthenes, in his book on India, mentioned an Indian tradition and genealogy existing for over 7,000 years, and a figure called Heracles (compared to [[Shri Krishna]]) from 13 generations prior, aligning with the 6th millennium BCE timeline for Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Herodotus, in his "History of the World" (Book 2, Chapter 141-142), documented 341 genealogical statues in Egypt. Calculating based on 33 years per king, this leads to approximately 11,340 years, which, when added to Herodotus's time (500 BCE), pushes back to around 14,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. This date aligns with the period of the [[Analysis of Mahabharat and Ramayan | Ramayan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.
*   **Egyptian and Indian Cultures:** There is a strong linkage between Egyptian and Indian cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. Egyptian kings like Ramesses bear names similar to the Ikshvaku Dynasty (e.g., Dasharatha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. Both cultures possessed sophisticated astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. The Egyptian sun god Ra is akin to Ravi (Sun) in India, and Ram was a Suryavanshi (from the solar dynasty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Mayan and Indian Cultures:** Mexico's Mayan civilization also had sophisticated astronomy, and the author of the Indian astronomical text *Surya Siddhanta* is Mayasura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.
*   **Wider Connections:** Even Mongolian culture is noted to have worshiped a form of Bhairava, with their main deity, "Eternal Blue Sky," potentially similar to Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Such widespread commonalities suggest that what is known today as Hinduism (Sanatan Dharma) and Zoroastrianism are remnants of a much more widespread ancient faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

<br>
The speaker emphasizes that [[Shri Krishna]] was a real person who lived 7,500 years ago, demonstrating exceptional intelligence and a revolutionary approach (Murari) in everything he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. He is seen as a *Yuga Purush* (era-maker) and a *Jagat Guru* (guru of the world) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. His teachings, like the Bhagavad Gita, are studied globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. Oak also highlights that [[Shri Krishna]] himself took *diksha* (initiation) from various gurus, including Shiva, reflecting a concept of learning from everyone, which further defines him as a *Jagat Guru* (one who takes the world as his guru) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.

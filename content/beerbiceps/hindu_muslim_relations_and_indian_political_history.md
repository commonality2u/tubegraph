Dr. Subramanian Swamy, described as one of the most educated and controversial Indians in independent history, shares his perspectives on [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | Hindu-Muslim relations]] and [[indias_political_landscape | Indian political history]], offering strong and direct opinions rarely heard in public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of truth-speaking, even when it is controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Hindu-Muslim Relations

Dr. Swamy believes that being pro-Hindutva does not automatically mean being anti-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. He states that his wife is Parsi and his son-in-law is Muslim, and they do not feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. His daughter's marriage to a Muslim involved a Hindu ceremony (Arya Samaji laws), as the groom's father was an atheist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. He asserts that the DNA of all Muslims in India is the same as Hindus, meaning their ancestors were Hindus, and that on the ground, Muslims and Hindus share more or less the same culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

His core philosophy is to unite Hindus, shedding the falsehoods perpetrated during the British and Mughal periods, and to help Hindus understand their real history and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He highlights the high status of women in [[hinduism_and_ancient_scriptures | Hinduism]], citing goddesses like Saraswati (education), Durga (defense), Lakshmi (finance), and Kali (fierce fighter), noting that no other religion gives women such a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

Regarding the safety of average Indian Muslims, Dr. Swamy believes that the perception of being safe only with the Congress party originated during [[indias_political_landscape | Jawaharlal Nehru's]] time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. He claims the Congress party "pampered" and gave "goodies" to Muslims who supported them, leading to Hindu consolidation and the rise of the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. He asserts that if the BJP is in power, there will be no flare-up of [[religious_and_communal_issues_in_india | Hindu-Muslim riots]], unlike when the Congress was in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He also mentions that some nations at India's borders actively try to prevent amity between Hindus and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Indian Political History and Governance

Dr. Swamy has been involved in politics for a long time, starting with the Jan Sangh, which merged into the Janata Party, and then became the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. He states he is not from the RSS stock but his ideology largely coincided with theirs, and he became important for the RSS and BJP due to his ability to articulate and debate [[hindu_mythology_and_interpretation_as_history | Hindutva]] effectively in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. He attributes his continued presence in the BJP, despite PM Modi's intolerance towards others, to his deep roots in the Hindu cause as a "Hindu scholar" and "Hindu activist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. He cites his work in saving the Ram Setu and liberating temples from government control as examples of his contributions to the Hindu cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### Views on Past Prime Ministers and Political Figures

*   **Jawaharlal Nehru**: Dr. Swamy believes that since Nehru's time, there has been a deliberate attempt to make Muslims feel safe only with the Congress party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lal Bahadur Shastri**: Described as a very honest, straightforward, and efficient minister who became Prime Minister due to circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   **P.V. Narasimha Rao**: Became Prime Minister because Sonia Gandhi expected him to die soon, but his health improved, and he did a "hell of a lot of good work," raising India's growth rate from 3.5% to 8% in 5 years following Dr. Swamy's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46:00">[51:46:00]</a>.
*   **Indira Gandhi**: Dr. Swamy considers her regime much worse than PM Modi's, calling her a "sellout to the Russians" and involved in "many activities" that made her a "coward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>. He mentions cases like the "Narula case" where a railway minister was allegedly killed for trying to reveal truth, and the Emergency where 140,000 people were jailed without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. He claims his return to India during the Emergency and brief speech in Parliament contributed to her decision to call elections, which she subsequently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
*   **Rajiv Gandhi**: Described as a "wonderful man" and a "man of his word" who was nationalistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. He built the Indian army, put Ramayan on television, and allowed the Vishwa Parishad to begin digging at the Babri Masjid site, promising a temple once the problem was solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. Dr. Swamy worked with him and formed Chandra Shekhar's government with his support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
*   **Rahul Gandhi**: Dr. Swamy calls him an "idiot" who says "anything at any time" and tore up a bill during his prime ministership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. He believes Rahul Gandhi does not truly want to be in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.
*   **Sonia Gandhi**: Described as "hopeless" and someone who "has been working for all the anti-Indian forces in the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Dr. Swamy claims she bluffed about her education and was unfit to hold office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. He asserts that he and President Abdul Kalam prevented her from becoming Prime Minister by finding a technicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. He is currently prosecuting her for corruption in the National Herald case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.
*   **Manmohan Singh**: Described as a "wonderful man" but lacking a "spine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Dr. Swamy states that Sonia Gandhi was effectively running the country during his tenure, getting "anything she wanted done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

### Critique of PM Modi's Government

Dr. Swamy expresses "difficulty" with PM Modi, accusing him of telling lies, claiming credit for others' work (like the Ram Mandir project which Dr. Swamy claims he did) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, and for dishonesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. He hasn't interacted with Modi since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Modi once wanted him to head the BRICS Bank, which Dr. Swamy declined, suspecting Modi wanted him out of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

#### Economic Policy
Dr. Swamy, an economics professor from Harvard, claims that India will be in a "massive depression" by 2030 if PM Modi remains Prime Minister, resembling the 1930s Great Depression in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He states that the money from high income taxes is "not used for our development" but is deposited in offshore banks, leading to the country losing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

He criticizes the government's economic decisions, including:
*   Regularly raising income tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   Hiking interest rates, which discourages people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   Not caring about the demand side of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   Manipulating GDP growth data by evaluating it at current prices, which includes inflation, making the actual growth rate about 4% instead of the claimed 8-9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Dr. Swamy proposes abolishing income tax to create a "huge new mentality" and boost demand, suggesting people would save if offered 9% interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. He argues that income tax primarily burdens the middle and upper-middle class, who are the innovators and educated people, while the rich evade it and the poor don't pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

He credits Nitin Gadkari for road construction but notes that such progress is not seen elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

#### Governance and Foreign Policy
*   **Transparency and Lies**: Dr. Swamy asserts there is "no transparency whatsoever" and "a lot of lies" being spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. He points to PM Modi's claim that no Chinese entered Indian territory, which he calls a "lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. He claims China has occupied 4,065 sq km of undisputed territory in Ladakh since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. He criticizes the concept of a "buffer zone" in disputed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Electoral Bonds**: He describes the electoral bonds scheme as a "mighty scandal" with "dirty money" used for contracts, expecting more revelations soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Adani Case**: He mentions that the US has decided to prosecute Mr. Adani for activities unknown to India, highlighting a lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Cabinet and Leadership**: He states that Modi selects cabinet members who "won't have a spine" and will only "obey" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He exempts only Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh as people who can "stand up" and speak frankly, but they are not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He describes the BJP's internal workings as "all broken up," with everything nominated by Modi, suggesting a lack of healthy team spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy**: Dr. Swamy claims PM Modi dictates foreign policy, which lacks clarity on non-alignment, and questions India's relations with Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. He believes [[geopolitical_relations_of_india_with_pakistan_and_china | China]] is trying to "swallow a good part of your territory" and considers [[geopolitical_relations_of_india_with_pakistan_and_china | Russia]] a "servant of the Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. He asserts India is currently "less than third" in global standing, with France having more respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. To become a "first factor," India needs economic policy changes and to defeat the Chinese militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. He believes India can defeat China, citing past instances in 1967 and 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. He suggests Modi's inaction against China is due to blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

#### Media and Bravery
Dr. Swamy criticizes the media, claiming they are "shut up" by the Prime Minister's Office, with a "fiat" issued that no English newspaper in Delhi will publish anything about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. He views himself as unique within the BJP for speaking openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He attributes his bravery to not being "born that way" and his faith in Lord Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, also citing the Bhagavad Gita's philosophy of focusing on action rather than results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Future of India
Dr. Swamy remains optimistic about India's future, believing it will be a "great country" and can become "amongst the first three" or even "first two" within 5-6 years, easily overtaking China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This requires strong leadership that empowers people, rather than claiming all credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. His underlying purpose in life is to see India as a very strong country that recovers its lost land property and grows at 10% per year for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. He also highlights his personal achievement in getting Kailash Mansarovar opened for Indians after it was closed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

For the upcoming [[elections_and_political_strategy_in_india | election season]], Dr. Swamy believes the BJP will win, but he would prefer PM Modi either not contest or lose, as he considers Modi "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" due to his perceived lack of values and a potential "dictatorship" mentality, drawing parallels to Hitler and Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. He states that if Modi is reinstated, he might try to ensure there are no more elections for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Despite his strong criticisms, he does not intend to leave the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.

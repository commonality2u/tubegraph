Sanjay Dutt emphasizes the paramount [[understanding_and_accepting_personal_flaws | importance of humility]] and forgiveness as core tenets for a meaningful life, drawing from his own experiences through a "roller coaster ride" of challenges, including drug addiction, jail, and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. He advises against following his path but encourages learning from his mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>.

## Humility

Humility is described as a difficult, yet beautiful, quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>. Dutt believes it is one of the most beautiful attributes a person can possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. He teaches his children to "always be humble in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:02">[05:05:02]</a>.

A key aspect of humility is the ability to admit when one has done wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Sanjay Dutt states that he practices this himself and wishes to pass this quality on to his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. He views humility as a crucial lesson learned from his life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Despite going through tough times, such as jail, he asserts that he has "always been humble" and that these experiences did not break him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

> "If Improvement is the central theme that's all that matters that's what the meaning of human life is that you move on from your mistakes you learn from your mistakes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>

## Forgiveness

Forgiveness is considered "very important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, although it is acknowledged as a difficult act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Dutt highlights that forgiving someone who has wronged you makes you a "greater person than anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This concept is closely linked to his spiritual beliefs, particularly his devotion to Lord Shiva, whom he considers his anchor and rescuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, and who he feels is present in moments requiring forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

Sanjay Dutt connects the act of forgiveness to preventing internal harm: if a professional grudge turns into a personal one where you wish ill upon someone, that negativity will ultimately harm you internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The host also resonates with this idea, noting that life has been teaching him similar lessons about forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

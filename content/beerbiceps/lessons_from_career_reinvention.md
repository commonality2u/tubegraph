The journey of career reinvention, particularly after experiencing significant public and personal setbacks, can be a profound period of [[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | learning]] and self-discovery. This article explores the experience of Tanmay Bhat, a prominent figure in the Indian media industry, as he navigated the challenges of AIB's disintegration and rebuilt his career and personal life.

## Early Career and Mentorship
Tanmay Bhat's entry into the media industry began with a unique mentorship arrangement. His first mentor in the media industry was also one of his first personal coaching clients, a man he helped with his weight loss journey when YouTube didn't pay much. In return, this individual, whose company AIB (All India Bakchod) was once the top media company in the world of the Indian internet, mentored Bhat through the initial phase of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This mutual support established a foundation for Bhat's [[entrepreneurship_journey | entrepreneurship journey]] in media.

## The Disintegration of AIB and Its Aftermath
The story of AIB, including its startup and business phases, is significant, especially the period when the company disintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This event led to one of the "three worst moments" of Bhat's life: having to let all AIB employees go. He describes it as the first time the four founders were in a room with the whole office, and he broke down, crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. There was no way to explain the situation, just that "this is it guys, there's nothing else we can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

AIB faced severe financial challenges overnight, losing all brands and accumulating significant debt. As a non-funded company, they relied on reinvesting income, and projects they had shot couldn't be released, leading to production costs being sunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. They had money only until November end in the last year, and were in "severe debt," owing many people money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This period, particularly the moment of letting employees go, was considered the "darkest" of his life, as he questioned his entire existence after spending 10 years building the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### The Personal Toll
During this low period, Bhat was diagnosed with clinical depression in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. He found himself without an office to go to, spending days eating and sleeping on a couch, leading to a profound realization: "If I don't have an office to go to, what am I even a person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This rock bottom was also "revelatory" and "extremely enlightening," forcing him to realize that his self-worth was not solely tied to his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## The Period of Reinvention
To escape the constant media world environment of Mumbai, Bhat moved to Bangalore. A friend, Kunal Shah, advised him to surround himself with people outside his domain and use his sadness as "fuel for growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. In Bangalore, he consulted for companies, explored tech ideas, and surrounded himself with entrepreneurs from different fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This experience made him ready to quit the media industry and do something else entirely, just to be out of the public domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

Bangalore's environment, characterized by "wealth games" and collaboration rather than "status games" seen in Mumbai, provided a stark contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. He found it "optimistic" and full of people with "one germ of an idea" coming from all walks of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. This energy gave him "hope and spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Key Lessons Learned

### Redefining Self-Worth and Success
Bhat grappled with the societal metric of success being solely tied to career achievements and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He questioned why success isn't measured by happiness or being a good friend or family member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. His journey taught him that true self-worth is not in work, but "beyond that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Understanding "Hustle" and the "Void"
The speaker observes that the "need to hustle" often stems from a "void that you're trying to fill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Bhat explains his own hustle stemmed from insecurity about his looks, driving him to excel in studies, extracurriculars, writing, and eventually comedy to gain attention and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. While important in early career stages, he realizes this intense hustle can lead to neglecting personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### The Importance of "Flow"
Bhat articulates that the meaning of life involves creating goals that help one attain "flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Flow occurs when the challenge matches one's skills; too difficult leads to anxiety, too easy leads to boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Continually seeking this flow state in new goals is key to sustained engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Leadership and Insecurity
Reflecting on AIB's journey, Bhat identifies a crucial mistake: not hiring a CEO focused solely on running the company. As an artist, his judgment was impaired, unable to prioritize effectively, and always thinking about himself rather than the company and its 40 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. He also realized he was an "extremely insecure" leader, which manifested in ways that impacted his employees. He believes good leaders are secure within themselves, bringing out the best in others, while cruel managers often compensate for their own insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### Patience and Long-Term Games
A significant [[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | lesson]] learned was patience. Bhat realized that "life is extremely long" and "you don't have to be in a hurry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. He stresses the importance of playing "long-term games" rather than focusing solely on immediate gratification, a common pitfall in the social media era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

### Understanding People and News
Bhat learned that most people are "gray," not simply black or white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. He advises against taking news as absolute truth, as it often prioritizes views over nuanced reality, leading people to judge others without full context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He believes that those least accepting of others' flaws are often unaware of their own, and high empathy comes from self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

### Emotional Processing and Therapy
Bhat underwent intense therapy, which significantly increased his self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. He recognized his dependence on external validation, an "illness that gets to all social media influencers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. Therapy, he explains, is like "going to the gym for your head," offering a detached space to process thoughts that friends cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of emotional processing, especially for men, who often lack skills to vent or cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

### [[lessons_on_overcoming_lifes_challenges | Overcoming Life's Challenges]]: Physical and Mental Transformation
Bhat's physical journey, including an acute sleep apnea episode at 245 kg that almost killed him, is deeply intertwined with his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. He realized that losing weight is "equally a painful mental exercise," as the mind often cheats due to boredom or indiscipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>. He believes mastering one's brain requires emotional processing, and deep-seated beliefs from childhood bullying can make one feel they don't deserve happiness, leading to self-sabotage in weight loss efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

## Current Outlook and Future Endeavors
After his period of reinvention, Bhat is "immensely happy" and "a lot more positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. He now prioritizes "creative flow" and is focused on finishing writing a movie, and exploring opportunities in the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. He has invested in One Hand Clap, a company started by former AIB social media team members, who also helped AIB repay some of its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He also plans to start his own podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Professionals and Handling Challenges
Bhat seeks to hire "lazy geniuses" - people with fantastic ideas who find the shortest, quickest way to achieve goals, believing laziness is underrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. He looks for "brokenness" as an indication of drive and asks candidates about opinions where friends disagree to gauge radical thinking and fearlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. His deal-breaker is "refusal to learn" or "close-mindedness," preferring malleable brains that absorb new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

For those facing body shaming or bullying, he advises "just sit down and cry it out," emphasizing the importance of processing trauma rather than suppressing it, especially for men who lack emotional venting skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. He believes losing weight can drastically change one's thought process, urging young people to pursue physical activity like badminton or other sports for a more positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

He sums up his [[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | learnings]] with a simple message:
> "Life is long, life is incredibly long. Play long-term games. Everything isn't about now, even though the world might make you feel like everything's got to happen now. Just life is very long and take your time. Just make games and have fun playing it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>

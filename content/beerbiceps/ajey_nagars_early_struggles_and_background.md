Ajey Nagar, widely known as CarryMinati, maintains a clear distinction between his public persona and his private self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While his CarryMinati character is "very open," Ajey Nagar considers his personal life private and not for public sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He intentionally keeps aspects of his private life completely private, believing some parts should not be shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Personal Nature and Privacy
Nagar describes himself as a "very private person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This inclination towards privacy isn't a recent development but has been part of his personality since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. He recalls preferring to stay home and play with friends rather than going out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. He identifies as an introvert, mostly staying indoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

His room serves as his "world," where he works, plays games, and relaxes, referring to it as "my space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He emphasizes his love for privacy and avoiding "unwanted things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. One reason for this preference is the potential for fans to address him using the same language he uses in his videos, even in front of his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Impact of Early Fame
Being a famous teenager in India presents several challenges for Nagar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He notes that while teenagers are prone to "stupid things" and enjoy parties, his lifestyle is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He doesn't party much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Fame has impacted his ability to experience basic life events. He doesn't know how to drive because he "never got time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Similarly, he never experienced college life due to lack of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. He feels he missed out on the typical progression of life, such as learning to walk, going to school, college, and then working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This broken "normal cycle" sometimes brings a feeling of missing out on life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He expresses a desire to experience hostel life or flat-sharing to understand college experiences and create relatable content for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Despite these missed experiences, Nagar states that he has "no problem in life, zero" due to "God's blessings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He has already achieved many of his dreams at a young age, which sometimes leads to his "dreams ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Parental Relationship
Nagar's parents are also navigating his fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. They are experiencing this new phase of life, with colleagues and friends asking to be introduced to their son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. They are learning together how to deal with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. His mother has one rule regarding his content: "don't abuse your mother or sister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Nagar always keeps this in mind, especially during live streams, although sometimes he might react impulsively, for example, during a horror game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Philosophy on Effort and Experience
Nagar believes in giving "100%" to whatever he creates, ensuring no regrets later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He applies this philosophy to his work, stating that he gives his all, and if it doesn't work out, he moves on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

His biggest learning from his experiences is the importance of learning everything and gaining more experience in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He advocates for experiencing things in one's "own way" and "own style" rather than solely relying on traditional education or what others teach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He encourages trying things independently, as it leads to unique outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Nagar advises to "experience things" and "never say no to anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He suggests stepping out of one's comfort zone, as even negative experiences can become fond memories later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. He maintains a mindset of taking life "one day at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Nagar also states he doesn't feel pressure despite his massive following, as he conceptualizes the numbers as abstract rather than a physical audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He avoids taking pressure because he has observed that "when I take pressure, things go wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

The entertainment industry presents a unique set of [[challenges_and_struggles_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges]] and pressures, particularly concerning fame, privacy, and the influence of nepotism.

## Nepotism vs. Self-Made Journeys

In the film industry, there is a discernible difference in personalities between those who are self-made and those who enter through influence or "nepotism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While individuals from within the industry face their own set of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, there is an "innate sense of sh*tty" due to a deep-rooted security that comes from knowing it will be easier to navigate the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Conversely, those from outside the industry constantly worry about losing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Even highly successful self-made actors often experience a persistent sense of insecurity, which can surprisingly fuel their creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The journey of being self-made adds a significant layer to one's personality, instilling values such as appreciating every penny and understanding that success requires hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.

## Vulnerability and Scrutiny in the Industry

Despite common perception, being famous does not necessarily equate to empowerment or invincibility; instead, it often makes an individual more vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The constant public scrutiny means every step is taken with concern for public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Actors experience a lack of privacy, with fans approaching them for selfies even during traumatic or sick periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. There is a high expectation to always appear presentable, which is exhausting as one does not naturally wake up looking that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This constant external pressure, including comments on physical appearance even after illness, highlights the intense public scrutiny faced by actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## Sexism and Hierarchy

Sexism is prevalent in the industry, as it is in the country and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Subtle forms of sexism include practical issues like female actors' caravans being further from set than male counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. While seemingly trivial, such details can be significant for female actors wearing difficult costumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

To combat this, women often need to "put their foot down," which may ruffle feathers but is necessary for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The broader issue is a societal lack of respect for human beings, where a small physical difference between genders is given disproportionate weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Pressures Faced by Actors

### Female Actors
Female actors face immense pressure regarding their appearance, including makeup and perceived age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. They are expected to look presentable even if they are ill or on their "deathbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

### Male Actors
Male actors' pressures are often worse than those faced by women, particularly concerning the significant amount of money riding on their films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. The market value of a male actor can plummet if a film bombs, leading to immense "brick bats" and pressure to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Despite being lead actors, they have limited control over the final content, as films involve numerous crafts and collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. The failure of a big film can be devastating for these actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

## The Laborious Nature of Acting
Acting is a "laborious job," requiring actors to be physically, emotionally, and mentally engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Unlike many other professions, actors must constantly maintain their appearance and mental state for their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. For instance, portraying a drunken scene requires acting it out without actually consuming alcohol, as dialogues must be remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.# Industry Challenges and Nepotism

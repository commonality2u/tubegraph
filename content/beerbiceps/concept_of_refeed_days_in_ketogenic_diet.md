A significant concept to understand when following a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is the idea of refeed days, also known as "carb up days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Purpose and Frequency
Refeed days involve strategically increasing carbohydrate intake to a much higher level than typically allowed on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. These days should occur approximately every 10 to 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It's important not to take them any more frequently than that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Carbohydrate Intake
On a refeed day, you can consume between 400 to 500 grams of carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Important Restrictions
It is crucial that none of the carbohydrates consumed on a refeed day come from sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Even on these higher-carb days, sugar must be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Instead of sugary foods, carbohydrates should be sourced from items like rice or bread (e.g., in a burger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The guideline is to have a "cheat meal" that avoids sugar but allows for other carbohydrate sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

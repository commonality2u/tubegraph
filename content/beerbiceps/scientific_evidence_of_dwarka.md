The ancient city of Dwarka, associated with Shri Krishna, is a subject of significant historical and archaeological inquiry. Modern research, employing scientific methodologies, has sought to establish its historical veracity and exact timeline.

## Historical Context and Dating

Shri Krishna's Dwarka was described as being flooded and destroyed by rising sea waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This event is documented in the Mahabharat text as occurring 36 years after the [[mahabharat | Mahabharat War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. Given the accepted dating of the [[mahabharat | Mahabharat War]] to 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>, the destruction of Krishna's Dwarka is dated to 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This also marks the approximate time of Krishna's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

## Relocation and Prosperity

Krishna chose to move from Mathura to Dwarka due to ongoing conflicts and trade route issues with Jarasandha's kingdom, which controlled the Ganga and Yamuna river passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:28">[01:58:28]</a>. Jarasandha had defeated Krishna and the Yadus 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:21">[01:59:21]</a>. Krishna decided it was not worth continuously fighting and relocated to his ancestral land, re-establishing a kingdom there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:28">[01:59:28]</a>.

Dwarka, originally known as Kusali (or Kastali) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>, was established by Ratha, a descendant of Ikshvaku Manu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>. This location allowed for uninterrupted trade from anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>, leading to Dwarka becoming an "extremely prosperous place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:49">[02:05:49]</a>.

## Archaeological Findings and Interpretations

[[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | Archaeological evidence]] suggests the existence of older settlements in the Dwarka region. Objects dated to approximately 30,000 years have been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>, indicating a long history of human civilization.

The historical Dwarka is described as an island with multiple bridges connecting to the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This structure was ultimately destroyed by rising sea levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

However, caution is advised when interpreting [[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | archaeological findings]]. Previous research by Professor S.R. Rao and Professor B.B. Lal, while sincere, drew factually incorrect conclusions regarding the discovery of Krishna's Dwarka. They found objects from 200 BCE near the modern Dwarka temple, mistakenly attributing them to Krishna's ancient city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Both researchers later admitted their conclusions were wrong and retracted their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. It is possible for materials like copper to survive underwater for extended periods, but iron would rust and degrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## Location of Ancient Dwarka

The current Dwarka temple is not the site of Krishna's original city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>. Krishna's Dwarka is situated offshore from the modern Somnath temple in Gujarat, where an arrow indicates its approximate location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. The modern "Mul Dwarka" (Original Dwarka) is a land-based site that serves as a memory of the ancient submerged city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>.

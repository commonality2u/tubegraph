Dwarka, an ancient city with significant ties to [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Shri Krishna]], is a topic of extensive historical and scientific inquiry. Researchers, including Nilesh Oak, have focused on establishing its historical reality through a combination of textual, celestial, and archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Dating
[[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Shri Krishna]], a central figure in the [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Mahabharata]], is considered a historical person who lived approximately 7,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. The [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Mahabharata]] war is dated to 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, specifically 7,584 or 7,585 years before the present (as of the recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

According to the [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Mahabharata]] text, [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna's]] passing (Nirwan) and the subsequent flooding and destruction of his city, Dwarka, occurred 36 years after the [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Mahabharata]] War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. This places the event around 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>.

### [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Krishna's]] Lifespan
By cross-referencing information from the [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Mahabharata]], [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_indian_texts | Harivamsa]], and [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_indian_texts | Bhagwat Puran]], [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna's]] birth is calculated to be around 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. This calculation indicates that [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] lived for approximately 107 or 108 years (5633 BCE - 5525 BCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. This finding remarkably aligns with a verse from Madhvacharya's [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_indian_texts | Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya]], which states that [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] lived for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

## Evidence for Dwarka's Existence

### Location and Destruction
The ancient city of Dwarka was located off the coast of what is now Somnath, with an arrow on a map pointing into the ocean indicating its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49:00">[59:49:00]</a>. It is described as an island, *Dvaravati*, with multiple bridges connecting it to the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This island was destroyed by rising sea waters in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. The current city of Dwarka, where the [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] temple stands today, is not the original Dwarka but rather "Mul Dwarka," a place named in memory of the original sunken city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

### Archaeological and Celestial Evidence
There is significant [[archaeological_and_celestial_evidence | archaeological evidence]] for Dwarka, as well as [[astronomical_evidence_and_indian_texts | celestial evidence]] that corroborates its historical timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. While some researchers, like Professor S.R. Rao, have identified objects from 200 BCE and incorrectly claimed them as [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna's]] Dwarka, these conclusions have been corrected and retracted by others, including Professor David Frawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. The challenge lies in finding evidence that has survived 6,500 years underwater, although materials like copper can survive without rusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

The region where Dwarka was re-established by [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] was historically known as *Kusali* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. According to [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_indian_texts | Srimad Bhagwatam]], Kusali was established by King Rata, a descendant of Sharti, who was a son of Sash Manu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. Archaeological findings, including construction objects, have been dated to about 30,000 years in this region, suggesting ancient origins for the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

### Reasons for Relocation
[[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] relocated from Mathura to Dwarka due to persistent conflict with Jarasandha, the king of Patna, who frequently disrupted trade routes along the Yamuna and Ganga rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:58:28">[0:58:28]</a>. Jarasandha defeated [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] and the Yadus 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:21">[0:59:21]</a>. Recognizing the futility of continued conflict, [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] chose to move his people to their ancestral lands on the west coast, where Dwarka was re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:33">[0:59:33]</a>. This strategic move ensured uninterrupted trade access and led to Dwarka's immense prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

### Decline and Legacy
After the destruction of Dwarka and [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna's]] passing, surviving Yadus and their ladies were taken by Arjuna to Hastinapur and Indraprasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Parikshit was installed as king in Hastinapur, and [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna's]] great-grandson was established in Indraprasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. The decline of the Yadava clan, as described in texts, was attributed to their excessive prosperity leading to internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

## External Validations
The chronology of [[historical_evidence_for_mahabharata_and_ramayana | Indian history]], including the timeline of Dwarka and [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]], finds support in ancient Greek records. Megasthenes' writings refer to an Indian tradition of genealogy existing for over 7,000 years, mentioning a figure comparable to [[vishnu_in_different_regions_and_practices | Krishna]] (Heracles), which aligns with the sixth millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. Herodotus' historical accounts of Egyptian kings, when calculated based on their stated generations, also point to a timeline of 14,000 years, connecting to the period of [[historical_evidence_for_mahabharata_and_ramayana | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. These external historical accounts provide further validation for the deep antiquity of Indian civilization and the events described in its ancient texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

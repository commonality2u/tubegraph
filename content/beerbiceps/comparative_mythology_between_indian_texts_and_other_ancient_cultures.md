Nilesh Oak, an engineer and historian, employs a scientific and evidence-based approach to explore history, particularly focusing on the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] and [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]]. His methodology often contrasts with traditional academic archaeology, which he suggests can be limited by predetermined rules and a reluctance to consider deep antiquity for human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Oak emphasizes that expertise is an outcome of passion, reinforced by evidence and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He highlights that many great historical figures achieved expertise without formal degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

## Dating of Indian Epics

Based on his research, the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] is dated to more than 7,000 years ago, and the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] to more than 14,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Specifically, the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] is dated to 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, and the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] to 12,209 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Oak notes that the time difference between the modern era and the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] is roughly the same as the time difference between the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] and the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

The concept of 'Yuga' in the Indian context refers to a period of time, with multiple definitions. One interpretation connects Yugas to actions and emotional states rather than strict chronological periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. Another definition involves astronomical calculations for planetary orbital periods, which have been mistakenly used for Yuga durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. The [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] also suggests that the type of Yuga is influenced by the administration of a king or administrator, and by the civic sense of the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## Geographical Connections

### Lanka's True Location
According to Oak, the modern island of Sri Lanka was likely part of Ravana's kingdom, but it was not the Ravana's Lanka described in the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Ravana's Lanka was located east of the Maldives, where currently there is only deep ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Sri Lanka received its current name in 1972, and ancient texts refer to it as "Singhal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. The geological anomaly of a very thin Earth's crust east of the Maldives suggests a past geological event that might have submerged Ravana's Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | South American Links]]
Indian texts contain extensive geographical descriptions that point to connections with South America.

*   **Patal**: Puranas like Bhagwat Purana describe King Bali, who was subdued by Vamana, moving to "Patal," where he established several colonies (Sutala, Atala, Talatala, Rasatala) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Oak suggests Patal refers to [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | South America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Virochana**: In [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | South America]], particularly among the Incas, there is a story of a civilizing figure named Virocha (Virochana), who came from across the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Virochana is described as Bali's great-great-grandfather in Indian texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Aztecs and Nagas**: The Aztecs in Mexico are linked to the word "Astika," which refers to sages connected with Nagas in Indian texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Nagas, often depicted as serpent-like beings, are described as human beings in the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This suggests ancient migrations or cultural exchanges.
*   **Sugriva's Atlas and the Candela bra of Andes**: In the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]], Sugriva's instructions to the Vanara parties searching for Sita serve as an ancient atlas. His description of landmarks in the East points to [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | South America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
    *   After crossing the Pacific, he describes a region of Lord Ananta, marked by a trident-like structure inscribed on a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This precisely matches the "Candelabra of Andes" in Peru, a 800-foot tall trident-shaped geoglyph that locals don't know the origin of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   The [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] states this insignia was established by Indra to mark the end of the East Direction in the Krita Yuga, long before the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
    *   Furthermore, a peak in the Andes is named Mount Ananta, aligning with the texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Northern and Southern Regions
Sugriva's descriptions extend to other parts of the world:

*   **North**: He describes the कैलाश (Kailash) area, a beautiful land with cooler temperatures and no trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Beyond that, the "land of many rivers" corresponds to parts of China, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, known as Utara Kuru and Utara Madra in Indian literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. He warns against going further north due to ice age conditions, describing the Arctic Sea and even the Aurora Borealis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **South**: Sugriva's directions include a description of Antarctica, which was "officially" discovered by Europeans in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Oak refers to 15th-century maps by individuals like Piri Reis, a Turkish admiral, which show landmasses in Antarctica, indicating prior knowledge possibly derived from ancient Indian or Arab maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **West**: Sugriva describes a chain of mountains from India through Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Romania, all the way to the Alps in Europe, which he calls "Airi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Linguistic Parallels

### Zoroastrianism and [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Indian Mythology]]
There are strong parallels between Zoroastrianism and Sanatana Dharma. For instance, in Zoroastrian mythology, 'Deva' is villainous and 'Asura' is noble, whereas in [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Indian mythology]], 'Asura' is villainous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This reversal suggests a shared linguistic and cultural root, possibly indicating two warring tribes in ancient history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. In the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Rigveda]], the term 'Asura' is actually eulogized and used for high deities like Indra and Varuna, suggesting its negative connotation developed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Rakshasas and Nagas
Nilesh Oak explains that 'Rakshasas' (like Ravana) and 'Nagas' were human beings, not mythical creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. The Sanskrit word 'Rakshasa' originally meant "one who protects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Over time, due to the corrupting influence of power, the term may have come to denote those who turned against society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Ravana, for example, was a descendant of a great sage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. These individuals were powerful human beings, capable of transnational marriages and extensive control over territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Ancient Knowledge and Catastrophic Events

### Mega-fauna and Ancient Scientific Knowledge
The [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] describes mega-fauna, such as "four-tusk elephants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This aligns with modern zoological understanding that only 1% of animals that ever existed are alive today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, and the biggest extinction event happened around 11,000 BCE, at the beginning of the Younger Dryas period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Ramayana]] also contains descriptions of vampire bats in [[historical_connections_between_ancient_india_and_south_america | South America]], which are found exclusively in that region today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These details suggest a deep level of [[ancient_scientific_knowledge_in_Hindu_scriptures | ancient scientific knowledge]] and observation embedded in these texts.

### Sea Level Changes and Lost Civilizations
Nilesh Oak connects ancient narratives of submerged lands with modern geological data on catastrophic sea-level rise events. These events are not always global but vary locally due to factors like tectonic plate movement and land subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

*   **Atlantis**: Plato's account of Atlantis sinking 9,000 years before his time (which translates to 11,000 years ago from today, or 9,000 BCE) aligns with a significant sea-level rise event (C2, 11.5 meters) in geological records around that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Dwarka**: The [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] states that Krishna's Dwarka was destroyed by gushing seawater 36 years after the [[interpretations_of_the_ramayana_and_mahabharata_using_modern_tools | Mahabharata]] War, which places its destruction around 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. Geological data from the Arabian Sea confirms a sudden 15-meter sea-level rise in the middle of the 6th millennium BCE (5525 BCE), directly supporting the [[literary_evidence_from_ancient_texts | literary evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. This event (C3) was primarily caused by the melting of Antarctic ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. Graham Hancock's research on Dwarka also aligns with this dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.
*   **Black Sea Formation**: Research by geologists Ryan and Pitman from Columbia University, published in "Noah's Flood" (1995), indicates that the Black Sea was formed by a sudden influx of salty water breaking through the Bosphorus Channel around 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. This event coincides precisely with the timing of Dwarka's destruction, suggesting a globally interconnected series of catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.

## Reflections on Modern Academia
Oak criticizes modern academia, especially in history and archaeology, for often dismissing [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | ancient texts]] and deep antiquity based on their own preconceived notions and "fictions" that became established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. He argues that if researchers are not looking for evidence of older civilizations, they will not see it, even if it is presented to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. He believes that scientific revolutions occur by disproving previous theories, and historians should embrace new evidence that challenges existing paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. His work aims to bridge the gap between [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | ancient Indian scriptures]] and scientific evidence, offering a more comprehensive understanding of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

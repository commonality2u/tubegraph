*   **Utilize Google**: The primary method for figuring out color combinations is Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00"></a>. For example, to determine if a blue t-shirt goes with gray pants, simply Google it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00"></a>.
*   **Experimentation**: The more you experiment with new outfits and research, the better you will become at dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00"></a>.

## Classic Clothing Combinations

## Incorporating Different Pants

Experimenting with different types of pants can significantly alter your overall look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00"></a>.
*   **Chinos**: Chinos are an excellent first investment after jeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00"></a>.
    *   Pairing a black t-shirt with dark blue jeans creates a dark outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00"></a>.
    *   Switching to gray chinos with the same black t-shirt lightens the mood, making it suitable for clubbing or a lunch date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00"></a>.
    *   **Versatile Chino Colors**: For a sober and versatile wardrobe, invest in gray and black chinos as they are neutral colors that pair with almost any other color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00"></a>. Brands like Markx and Spencer, Jack and Jones, or Zara often have good quality chinos for around 1,500 rupees, lasting 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00"></a>.

## The Role of Accessories

Accessories, specifically watches, play a significant role in completing an outfit and conveying a sense of class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00"></a>.
*   **Watches**: Watches suggest you are a busy person who values time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00"></a>. Different watches can change how an outfit feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00"></a>.
    *   **Semi-casual watches**: These can be worn with both formal and casual clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00"></a>. A blue-faced, neutral silver watch can look professional for work or a date and can be worn with blue or other outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00"></a>.
    *   Even a formal watch can create a stylish statement with a casual, "badass" outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00"></a>.
*   **Experimentation**: Trying different combinations of watches and outfits helps in finding what works best for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00"></a>.

## Confidence in Dressing

A well-dressed man continuously changes his attire, wearing shirts, t-shirts, or polos, and varies his pants, but most importantly, carries every outfit with confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00"></a>. This confidence is gained through experimentation and figuring out what looks good on your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00"></a>.

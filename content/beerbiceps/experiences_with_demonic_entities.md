This article, featuring insights from Rajash Nandi, serves as the finale of a trilogy on Tantra and the Occult, exploring darker concepts and spiritual experiences within ancient Indian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The intention is to educate about these concepts without adding darkness to one's life, encouraging a movement towards light and goodness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Personal Encounter with Entities
Rajash Nandi shared a personal [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis and personal experiences]] experience involving negative entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. While performing a spiritual practice (upasana), he began to feel a peculiar heaviness and experienced strange thoughts of murder and suicide, which he initially dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Negative and violent dreams of "death destruction" also occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. After two or three days, he realized these thoughts were not his own, a common understanding in yoga where 90% of thoughts are not inherent to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The extreme negativity, violence, and death-related thoughts became so disturbing that he couldn't meditate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. He also experienced sudden, out-of-character conflicts with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. To counter this, he performed a Mantra sadhana of Matara (a deity he was worshipping at the time) for two to two and a half hours, followed by a small fire ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

During this practice, he reached a detached state where he could perceive things otherwise imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He saw two entities standing directly in front of him in his room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. One was "significantly negative looking," short, human-like in appearance but clearly not human, exuding extreme negativity, particularly from its eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Behind it, another entity stood, "very calm" but felt "even more dangerous" due to its "cold evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. These entities were causing the mental torment and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

This experience highlights that entities can interfere with spiritual practices, as it is their nature to cause disturbance and feed on the energy of disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Some [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | types of spiritual beings and their influences]] specifically target practitioners to disrupt their rhythm and cause their energy to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This is consistent with ancient texts like the Ramayana, where Asuras would destroy yagas (fire rituals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. These powerful entities primarily influence individuals who can cause large-scale destruction, such as historical figures like Hitler, believed to be influenced by an Asura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Understanding Negative Entities

### Bhoot (Discarnate Entities)
Bhoots are discarnate entities, meaning they lack a physical body, and may roam this plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. Their tendencies are very human, experiencing hunger, anger, or lust, but remaining trapped on this plane without the ability to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. When agitated, they can cause trouble to those in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. The astral plane, where these entities exist, overlaps with the physical plane, though it is not visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

Some bhoots, known as Pitrus, are ancestors who have died but are stuck in Pitru Loka, a part of the astral plane, unable to take rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. They may unconsciously project their problems, like anger, onto their living descendants due to strong genetic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. Rituals, such as offering "pindad" (rice balls) and specific mantras at places like Trimbakeshwar or Gaya, are performed to pacify these spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

Some spirits may not even realize they are dead, experiencing a sense of shock and difficulty accepting their non-physical state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. These stuck entities cause disturbances, block things, and draw attention to their unsatisfied desires, such as hunger without a body to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

### Pret (Angry Spirits)
Pret are considered more dangerous than bhoots, characterized as very angry spirits, akin to a "mad dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. They could be formally human beings who are in a highly negative state due to twisted karmas, or entities who indulged in negative practices, or those who experienced violent, non-conventional deaths (e.g., accidental death at a young age, suicide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

Pret can cause diseases, obstructions in efforts, and accidents to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Their presence might lead to strange negative occurrences, making one feel as if their destiny is against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. They can also cause physical harm, including scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. These entities can enter dreams, making them a significant threat in the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

### Pishach (Dangerous Entities)
Pishachas are even more dangerous than Prets, described as "mad bulls" due to their irrational and unreasonable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Many Pishachas were never incarnated as human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. However, a specific type, "Brahma Pishacha," refers to highly knowledgeable spiritual individuals who misused or withheld knowledge, leading to their negative state after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

These entities are confined to specific areas with extreme negative energy, often characterized by very dark, filthy settings and a recurring foul odor without a discernable source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. Their interest in human beings lies in influencing them, gaining attention, and spreading their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. Some people even perform upasana of Pishachas (or Pishachini, a female form) to gain information, but this is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. Higher deity upasana (e.g., Shiva, Vishnu, Durga) creates vibrations that Pishachas dislike, causing them to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

Gins, mentioned in other cultures, are considered a broad term encompassing Bhoots and other entities, and there are ways to counter them through self-protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

### Rakshasas and Asuras (Highest Negatives)
Rakshasas and Asuras are described as the "highest of the negatives" in Dharma, with nothing beyond them in negative scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. It is unlikely they incarnate physically in the current era due to their immense power, which no human being, not even the best saints, could withstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

However, their influence is very much possible, affecting people's minds from their own planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Asuras possess higher intellect and intelligence; they are not atheists but powerful practitioners who misuse their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. They live in realms where time moves very slowly, and they don't perceive karma in the same way humans do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

Stories from sacred texts, like Devi Mahatmyam, describe battles between goddesses and Asuras (e.g., Mahishasura) lasting hundreds of years, which can be seen as astral battles from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. These narratives serve to provide spiritual benefit through remembrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. An important concept is that anyone who dies at the hands of a great God is liberated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

The use of occult aspects of Tantra for influencing outcomes is popular, particularly among politicians and film industry individuals in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. These practices, known as "Prayog," can be used for positive aspects (e.g., boosting careers) or negative ones (e.g., removing enemies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. While prayers to deities have no karmic consequence if the deity has the right to reject them, demanding a specific result through a defined method will incur a karmic payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This means a practitioner might face injuries or issues in their own life to balance the invoked power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

## Protection and The Path of Sadhana

### Dealing with Skepticism
The speaker, once a skeptic himself, believes that skepticism is a natural progression and cannot be overcome by arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. An experience outside the normal realm of existence can change a skeptic's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>. Personal experiences, rather than words in books, are suggested as the best way for a skeptic to find proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. The speaker himself became a believer after a profound experience during a Durga Puja where he saw the deity vividly and later met a guru who knew intimate details of his life without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

### Methods of Protection
To protect oneself from these [[dealing_with_entities_and_dark_forces | dealing with entities and dark forces]], the speaker strongly advises against entering such zones out of mere curiosity, especially through activities like Ouija boards or spirit calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. These entities can be called easily, but the consequences are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

The best defense for an average human being is to perform upasana (worship and practice) of a main deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. This provides fundamental protection against [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | ghostly experiences and paranormal investigations]] and [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | understanding spirits ghosts and demonic entities]]. A trained exorcist, similar to an army professional, knows how to protect themselves when intentionally engaging with such entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. For others, neglecting this primary root of spiritual practice can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

The more one meditates and spiritualizes, the more protected they become from darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Meditation not only protects the mind in the long term but also provides stability in dark moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Specific deities are known for their protective qualities and faster responses:
*   **Lord Hanuman** is an immortal being who resides in this plane, making him quick to respond to pleas for strength, power, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Chanting the Hanuman Chalisa with faith, especially a structured upasana for 40 days while observing celibacy and meditating on Lord Rama's name, can lead to a transformative experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Lord Bhairava** is another deity who protects very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.
*   In contrast, invoking Lord Shiva (Mahadev) in his meditative state might take many lifetimes to elicit a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

### The Role of a Guru
A good guru is essential for guiding practitioners through spiritual experiences, discerning what to take seriously, and preventing attachment to transient phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>. When seeking a guru, it's important to consider their "guru parampara" – a lineage of at least three generations of accomplished gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:50">[03:00:50]</a>. In Tantric upasana, worshipping the gurus and invoking their blessings (tarpanam) is crucial for protection and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>.

A guru can help identify [[exorcism_and_demonic_possession | exorcism and demonic possession]] or other negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:14">[02:51:14]</a>. They can also provide context for experiences, such as the appearance of 'Ghanas' (attendants of a deity) before the main deity, testing the practitioner's capacity to handle intense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:42">[02:37:42]</a>.

### Maintaining Discipline
Progress in spiritual practice also depends on unwavering discipline and faith, even without immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Nature acts as a filter; those who continue with devotion, even when uncertain of the outcome, have a chance to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:04">[03:11:04]</a>. While initial stages might bring rapid experiences, there is often a plateau—a "test" where many fall off due to boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:59">[03:13:59]</a>.

## Higher Dimensions and Protection
The principle of "brahmande so pindande" (whatever is in the universe is also in the body) suggests that higher realms and dimensions are reflected within an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>. The astral plane contains all thoughts, ideas, and emotions, both positive and negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. Beyond this lies a silent causal realm where deities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

Achieving a high state of spiritual fitness (upasana) allows one to withstand interaction with deities without being rattled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. Such interactions can be transformative, leading to a more spiritual existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.

In yoga, piercing the "Vishnu Granthi" (a guardian knot) opens a pure space within the heart, allowing divine presence and bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:54">[02:40:54]</a>. Piercing the "Rudra Granthi" allows one to go beyond time, accessing the highest dimension where negative entities like Bhoots, Prets, and Pishachas cannot enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:38">[02:48:38]</a>. An individual who has activated either of these is completely protected and can stand unharmed amidst a hundred Asuras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:43">[02:43:43]</a>.

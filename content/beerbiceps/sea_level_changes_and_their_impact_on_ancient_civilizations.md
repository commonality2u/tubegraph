Ancient texts and modern [[Archaeological and celestial evidence | archaeological and geological data]] provide insights into significant sea level changes that impacted ancient civilizations, leading to events like the submergence of cities and islands.

## Evidence from Indian Epics

### Ravana's Lanka
The ancient capital of Ravana, known as Lanka in the Ramayana, was located east of the Maldives, where a deep ocean now exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This location is distinct from modern Sri Lanka, which was not Ravana's Lanka, despite being part of ancient Ramayana narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Even in histories dating back a thousand years, texts refer to Lanka as a separate place from Singal (the old name for Sri Lanka) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

The Earth's crust beneath the ocean east of the Maldives is noted as one of the thinnest, representing a geological anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. It is speculated that Ravana's Lanka might have been an island that became submerged due to significant volcanic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Instances of small islands with active volcanoes breaking into pieces and splitting on the ocean surface have been recorded in Indonesia as recently as two to three centuries ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that landmasses like the Maldives and Lakshadweep could potentially be remnants of such fragmented land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.

A "catastrophic sea level rise event" (CRE1) occurred around 14,200 years ago (12,200 BC), coinciding with the Ramayana period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. This event saw a sudden sea level increase of approximately 13.5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. This rise is a possible cause for the submergence of Ravana's Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

### Krishna's Dwarka
The city of Dwarka, associated with Krishna, was described in the Mahabharata as being flooded and destroyed by gushing sea waters 36 years after the Mahabharata War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. This event is dated to 5525 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Geological data from the Arabian Sea indicates a sudden 15-meter sea level rise around the middle of the 6th millennium BC (5525 BC), which directly corresponds to the destruction of Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

This specific sea level rise is considered a "catastrophic rise event" (CRE3) that occurred around 7,600 years ago (5600 BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. Unlike CRE1 and CRE2, which were driven by melting ice in the Northern Hemisphere, CRE3 was caused by ice melt from Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. The sea level rise was not uniform globally; for instance, while Dwarka experienced a 15-meter rise, Barbados saw only a 6.5-meter increase at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. Evidence of flooding and destruction from this 5525 BC event has been found in over 30 different locations around the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

## Global Warming and Catastrophic Rise Events

Global warming, while accelerated by pollution today, is also a natural phenomenon involving cycles of cooling and warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. The current sea level rise has been ongoing for the past 20,000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. This rise is generally smooth but is punctuated by "catastrophic rise events" (CREs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. These events are akin to large blocks of ice cracking and falling, causing sudden increases in water levels and significant weather changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

### The Atlantis Story
Plato described [[Historical and Geological Insights on Atlantis | Atlantis]] as having disappeared 9,000 years before his time (approximately 11,000 years ago from today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. This aligns with CRE2, an 11.5-meter sea level rise event that occurred around 11,500 years ago (9,500 BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>. This period also marks the end of the Younger Dryas climatic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

### Formation of the Black Sea
The formation of the Black Sea is another event linked to a catastrophic sea level rise. Research by geologists Ryan and Pitman from Columbia University suggests that a sudden influx of salty water into what was once a freshwater lake, forming the Black Sea, occurred around 5525 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. This was due to the force of rising sea levels in the Atlantic, pushing water into the Mediterranean, through the Aegean Sea, into the Sea of Marmara, and finally breaking through the Bosphorus Channel into the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. This event coincides with the destruction of Dwarka, indicating a shared global phenomenon.

## Broader Implications

These geological and historical correlations suggest a sophisticated understanding of geography and natural phenomena in ancient Indian texts. Sugriva's "Atlas" in the Ramayana, for instance, describes lands from the Andes to the Alps and from the Arctic Sea to Antarctica, including detailed landmarks, unique flora and fauna (like vampire bats in South America), and even climatic conditions like the Aurora Borealis and ice ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. Such detailed geographical knowledge, coupled with precise chronological accounts of catastrophic events, challenges modern academic perspectives that often dismiss deep antiquity for human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

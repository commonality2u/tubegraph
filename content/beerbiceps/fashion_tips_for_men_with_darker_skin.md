The quest for fairer skin has historical roots in imperialism, particularly affecting regions like Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific. During the imperialistic age, European countries promoted the idea of white skin being superior, a thought process that unfortunately persists in many Asian, African, and South American countries today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Media, such as old "Fair and Lovely" advertisements, further propagated the notion that fairness was necessary for better job prospects or finding love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

However, it is crucial to understand that skin color is genetic and should not be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on making your natural skin the best version of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Skin Care for a Natural Glow

### Avoid Skin Whitening Products
Do not pursue skin whitening, and avoid skin whitening creams. These products can harm your face in the long term, as they often contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which will spoil the quality of your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Managing Different Skin Types
To achieve healthy, glowing skin, tailor your approach based on your skin type:

*   **Dry Skin**: After washing your face, dry it thoroughly with a towel and then apply a mild moisturizer. A moisturizer is highly beneficial for dry skin that tends to flake, or for very dry lips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) can also be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Oily Skin**: A home remedy involves using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), which is readily available at Indian grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   Chip off a piece of Fuller's Earth and pound it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric and a squeeze of lemon juice to create a paste. Add a few drops of water if needed to achieve a smooth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry, but do not leave it on for longer than 20 minutes before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   The turmeric acts as an antiseptic, the lemon enhances glow, and the Fuller's Earth absorbs excess oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   Use this mixture no more than once or twice a week, ideally with a gap of 3 days, to avoid stimulating more oil secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. You may see changes within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Exfoliation
To achieve glowing, smooth skin, use a face scrub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Apply the scrub, which contains small hard particles, and massage your face firmly in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   This process increases blood circulation to your face, promoting skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   However, if you are prone to acne or have existing acne, avoid this method as it can harm inflammations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   For those without acne, exfoliation is effective for healthy, glowing skin, but limit it to once a week, perhaps on a Sunday or the same day you use the Multani Mitti mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Diet for Skin Health
For clear, glowing skin, focusing on your diet is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>:
*   **Hydration**: Stay hydrated throughout the day. A good indicator is clear urine; if it's slightly yellow, drink more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Vegetables and Fiber**: Prioritize vegetable and fiber intake over excessive fruit consumption. Vegetables are more nutritionally dense, providing more vitamins and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A quick rule of thumb is to include a variety of colored vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Grooming and Fashion for Men with Darker Skin

### Grooming: Beard Maintenance
For [[grooming_tips_for_men_with_darker_skin|men with darker skin]], focusing on neatness is key to looking handsome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   If you choose to keep a beard, ensure it is well-maintained. Use beard grooming products or at least trim it to appear neat, avoiding a bushy look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   If you tend to grow a patchy beard, it's advisable to avoid one entirely as it can make you look scruffy and may not be suitable for a corporate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In such cases, go clean-shaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   For an example of a well-maintained beard that enhances looks, consider Virat Kohli's beard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Fashion: Prioritize Physique
When it comes to fashion, your physique is almost 90% of the game in pulling off any clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   You don't need to be a bodybuilder or extremely ripped; simply looking healthy with filled-out arms, chest, legs, and back is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This can even be achieved through home workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Choosing Colors Based on Physique
The general rule of darker skin tones avoiding bright colors becomes irrelevant if you have a good physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Good Physique**: If you have a good physique, you can wear absolutely any color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Skinny or Plus-Size Physique**: If you are very skinny or slightly on the heavier side, bright colors should be approached with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Bright colors like white, bright red, orange, or bright blue draw attention to your body, and the contrast with your skin tone can highlight your physique even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In these situations, it's better to avoid brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Recommended Colors**: Ideally, prioritize darker colors for your t-shirts and shirts. Colors like black, navy blue, brown, olive green, dark gray, and dark maroon pair very well with a slightly dark, wheatish Indian skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, remember that choosing colors is not as important as your physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Final Advice: Confidence and Self-Love
Ultimately, attractiveness is not solely based on external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. People are attracted to positivity and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Before focusing on fashion and [[grooming_tips_for_men_with_darker_skin|grooming tips for men with darker skin]], learn to love yourself and be comfortable in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In today's world (2018), all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Anyone who promotes the idea that dark skin doesn't look good or that you should get rid of your suntan is promoting racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

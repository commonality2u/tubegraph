This episode offers profound insights into personal growth, spiritual wisdom, and navigating life's challenges, directly from the experiences and teachings of a monk. The conversation delves into the deep aspects of the mind and intellect, aiming to inspire those seeking continuous self-improvement and a legendary life status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Journey to Monkhood and the Lesson of Humility
The speaker's last ten years have been the most fruitful, building upon a 15-year foundation spent in a monastery or ashram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This period served as a "foundation" before the "building blocks" of reaching out and creating content to transform lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Growing up in a middle-class family near Pune, the speaker was influenced by individuals who sought to make a difference: a school teacher who taught English for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, a group of youngsters who collected and distributed food to the needy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, and his father who put extra effort into his work to benefit others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These experiences led the speaker to personally coach two financially poor students in mathematics for a year, finding firsthand experience in making an impact and seeing the gratitude of their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Before joining the monastery, the speaker experienced significant personal achievements, including being a university topper, a vocalist, a guitarist, and securing a job with Hewlett-Packard (HP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He had "tasted the pudding of achievements," "control," and "power," where people respected and "bent down" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Upon entering the monastery, surrounded by monks who were equally or more accomplished academically and professionally, the first "pudding" tasted was humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This was initially "forced humility" as his previous bubble of being "someone" burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. He learned that humility is an "incredible foundational premise" for spiritual, personal, and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. True knowledge, he states, is "knowing that you don't know it all," contrasting with ego which says "I know it all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This acceptance that others are better paved the way for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The experience resonated with the "Doctor Strange" movie plot, where a man of science is humbled by a world of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Purpose and Non-Conformism
A key lesson from the monastic order is to keep one's "attention and focus constantly on what you're meant to do in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. If one hasn't discovered their purpose, even "the smallest trivia can disturb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, but with focus on purpose, "the largest setbacks can be handled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of being a non-conformist, stating that "the greatest killer of your personal spiritual professional growth is conformism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Conforming to societal or familial expectations (like job, home, car, clothes) can lead to "90,000 hours of dissatisfaction" and prevent excellence, which "only comes when you do something that truly resonates with your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. While parents' dreams are important, spending 90,000 hours of one's life in a job for money, rather than fulfillment, is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## A Monk's Daily Life and Modern Outreach
The speaker's day, even now, typically starts between 3:30 AM and 4:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. This is followed by group meditation and prayer sessions until 7:15 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Mornings include discussions on scripture and spiritual principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Monks engage in various services within the institution, such as admin, online courses, managing digital platforms, guest reception, temple worship, and kitchen operations (serving over 400 meals daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. Evenings might involve sharing messages with university students or creating social media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

For the past three to five years, the speaker's life has shifted towards online content creation and extensive travel (averaging 150-180 flights annually, even 280 in one year) for corporate events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. He aims to integrate spiritual values into business, focusing on work ethic and organizational ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. He also dedicates time to one-on-one life coaching, helping individuals evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Meditation and Mindfulness in Daily Life
His meditation practice begins immediately upon waking with gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. His formal meditation practice, which he has done for 25 years without missing a day, is Mantra meditation (chanting on beads) for an hour and a half daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This practice initially presented the challenge of remaining present and achieving a "zone of thoughtlessness" due to the mind's tendency to multitask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

He emphasizes that "everything that we do in our life as meditation" feeds into the formal practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This includes:
*   **Mindful Eating**: Eating one meal a day alone, without distractions like phones or books, to be fully present and savor the experience of touching, feeling, smelling, and tasting the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Single-Tasking**: Avoiding multitasking even in simple activities like bathing; focusing entirely on the experience of the water rather than singing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

These "little things through the day" train the mind to be in the present, which then enhances the "mainstream practice of meditation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. He highlights that consistent effort in "doing the same things rightly" brings results, rather than constantly seeking new practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

## Spirituality, Rituals, and "Baba Culture"
The speaker clarifies that his public message is "faith and religion agnostic," focusing solely on "wisdom that can transform life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. This approach has garnered a secular following across all faiths and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

The saffron robes signify "flames of fire," indicating that his "selfish interests" have been consumed, and his life is now dedicated to the "betterment and Welfare of others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. It means "killing your own ego" and living for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. The saffron analogy also suggests being "roasted" and "crushed" by life's experiences to add "color fragrance and flavor to the lives of others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. The shaved head (or long hair/beard in other traditions) symbolizes detachment from the body and personal grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>. The Tika on the forehead signifies "affiliation to a certain Faith," much like a flag on a government building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

Rituals, he explains, are not exclusive to religion but are "part of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Examples include giving a rose on Valentine's Day, using language, giving gifts, or singing a birthday song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. The crucial distinction lies in the "spirit" (SPI) within the ritual. When the spirit is present, it becomes "spiritual" (SPI-ritual); when the spirit is gone, it's a "mere ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Many youth reject traditional religion because they perceive it as merely ritualistic without spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

Regarding "Baba culture," he acknowledges the need for mentors or gurus in spirituality, just as in other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. The problem arises when the spiritual leader becomes the "focal point" and the "spiritual wisdom" takes a backseat, turning it into a "cult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. To bring youth back to true spirituality, there's a need for "spiritual leaders who are not attached to their face, who are not attached to their name, who are not attached to their institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>, and who clearly profess that it's about the wisdom, not them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

## Benefits of Spirituality for Youth
Spirituality, particularly meditation and mindfulness practices, offers tangible benefits for young people:
*   **Improved Focus and Concentration**: Training the mind to be in the present directly improves focus and concentration in studies or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
*   **Healthier Relationships**: By connecting deeply to oneself and finding "self validation" and "selfworth" internally, one becomes less dependent on others for happiness, leading to a greater capacity to give in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. This reduces disappointment from expectations and is also true for social media, where self-worth should not be based on "likes, comments, and shares" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

### [[Lessons on overcoming lifes challenges | Dealing with Heartbreak]]
For intense breakups, especially when betrayal like cheating occurs, the speaker offers a three-step healing process:
1.  **Accept and Feel Emotions**: It's okay to feel negative emotions like depression. Don't fight them. Give yourself time and accept that imperfections are part of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. Men especially should not feel pressured to "heal fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. Crying and admitting feelings like depression requires courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.
2.  **Confide in a Trustworthy Person**: Find someone trustworthy (a friend, family member) to "pour out unedited uncensored" emotions without fear of judgment or breach of confidentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. This helps to feel lighter by externalizing the burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
3.  **Plan the Next Step**: Begin looking at "what's the next thing to do," whether it's another relationship or no relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>. This step takes varying amounts of time for different individuals, but decisions should be based on reason, not solely past emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. Spirituality, meditation, and chanting can help "declutter" the mind and "accelerate healing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.

### Spirituality as Life Transformation
For the speaker, spirituality is not about "supernatural" or "occult" experiences, but rather about "how it transforms my living, your daily life, my perspectives, My World Views, my Outlook towards relationships, my Outlook towards the work I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. It is a "life transforming Journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

## [[The Bhagavad Gita and its nonreligious philosophy | The Bhagavad Gita]]: A Guide to Life
The speaker strongly recommends [[the_bhagavad_gita_and_its_nonreligious_philosophy | The Bhagavad Gita]], asserting that it is "not a religious book" but "a book which gives you the way to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra during the Mahabharat, it addresses Arjun's confusion and dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. [[Krishnas Teachings and Philosophy | Krishna]] acts as a facilitator, empowering Arjun to make his own choices and realize his inherent power beyond his current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

[[Understanding the Bhagavad Gitas teachings | Three major lessons]] from the Bhagavad Gita that resonated with the speaker are:
1.  **Tolerance of Ups and Downs**: Like summer and winter, life's seasons (ups and downs) come and go, but one must learn to tolerate them and "not be distracted from what our main purpose is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This applies to both pain (failures) and success, as both can distract from one's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
2.  **The Mind as Friend or Enemy**: The mind can be either a friend or an enemy depending on how one deals with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. A trained mind, supported by practices like meditation, good books, and the right company, becomes one's "greatest asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
3.  **Perceiving Divinity Everywhere**: One should strive to see "the presence of divinity everywhere," not just in places of worship, but in nature, other people, and the splendor of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. When observing someone better in the same field, instead of insecurity or envy, one should see how "Divinity has empowered somebody to do something in a special way" and derive inspiration to pursue one's own aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. This recognizes an "X Factor" beyond personal effort in remarkable achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

## Coaching Leaders and the Concept of Capacity
Top business and corporate leaders often seek coaching once they've reached the pinnacle, realizing that the "number game" isn't all there is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. They seek "meaning and purpose and ability to create impact" beyond financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. The drive to be "number one" can be "intoxicating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>, leading some to compromise personal life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. A grounded and supportive spouse is the "greatest asset" for such leaders, providing an anchored space to be authentic without the need to "wear a mask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>.

The speaker uses the analogy of water bottles of different capacities (e.g., 500 mL, 1 liter) to explain personal potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. Everyone has a certain capacity, and the goal is to "function to the optimum of Your Capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. It's not necessarily about becoming a billionaire, but about maximizing one's potential, even if it's to be a millionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Self-reflection and introspection are crucial to understanding one's capacities, passions, and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>. Pushing beyond one's "bandwidth" or natural capacity comes "at the cost of other things that matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>.

The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of not putting a "cap on your capacity to impact people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. When the purpose is to make an impact, numbers (like followers or wealth) will follow as a consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

## Recommended Books
If he could give five books to every human being in the world, they would be:
1.  [[the_bhagavad_gita_and_its_nonreligious_philosophy | The Bhagavad Gita]]: A guide to life, removing religious connotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.
2.  "The Journey Home" by Radhanath Swami: His Guru's journey into India and life lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

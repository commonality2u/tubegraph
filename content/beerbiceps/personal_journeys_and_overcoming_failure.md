Robert Kiyosaki's **personal struggles and growth journey** is marked by significant experiences, including a challenging academic past, military service, and persistent efforts in financial education despite facing opposition. He views his life's contribution with humility, blessing, and honor, coupled with a sense of responsibility to continue his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>. He believes there is "more work to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:08">[03:18:08]</a>.

## Academic Challenges and Early Struggles
Kiyosaki admits he "flunked out of school because I cannot write" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:06">[02:25:06]</a>. His difficulties stemmed from a "LoveHate relationship" with writing, as his teachers at 15 and 18 years old disliked his writing, which he attributes to him not liking his teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. He holds a strong negative view of the traditional education system, stating, "the biggest criminals in the world are School teachers I really don't like school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:07">[08:55:07]</a>. He has faced professional attacks for his views, noting that 39 professors "attacked me because I was talking about capitalism" in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:08">[09:05:08]</a>. He contends that many school teachers are Marxists or Communists, who "don't have the money building mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:03">[09:16:03]</a>. He famously stated in his first book, "if you want to be a rich don't go to school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:06">[02:45:06]</a>, which garnered significant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:08">[10:40:08]</a>.

## Military Service and its Enduring Impact
Kiyosaki served as a pilot in Vietnam, going to "school to kill people" and killing "a lot of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He notes that military school training instills a different way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He "went down three times in Vietnam" and lost many friends who "don't come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This experience taught him discipline, as he learned "I do what I have to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. His military service also prepared him to [[facing_challenges_and_overcoming_obstacles_in_the_entertainment_industry | face death]] and endure hardships, stating he has "had people put guns to my head" and "had to kill people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

Upon returning from Vietnam in 1972, he faced an unwelcoming reception from "hippies" who "were spitting on us hitting us with eggs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. He describes still feeling "a little bitter about it" because he and his friends "fought for our country we fought for freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. His current fight for freedom is through education, with the same intensity he fought in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Adversity and the Importance of Integrity
Robert Kiyosaki has faced considerable adversity throughout his life, particularly as described by the interviewer, who notes "how much failure you've come across constantly and then you've woken up from the failure and moved ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This resilience in [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | overcoming setbacks and failures]] and the [[importance_of_failure_as_a_teacher | importance of failure as a teacher]] is a core theme in his journey.

He emphasizes integrity, defining it as being "whole," where "your mind your words heart your actions" are "one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He applies this principle to his investments, choosing assets like Bitcoin because "it has integrity" due to blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with his view of "fake money" (fiat currency) which he calls "toilet paper" and attributes to causing poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Kiyosaki maintains that money itself is not evil; it is "what you do for your money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. He believes one can "do good and make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. He views money as an "enabler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a> and focuses on making money "legally, ethically, moral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Life Philosophy and Legacy
Kiyosaki defines his life's goal as "how much good do I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. He states, "I don't need money" once one understands it as a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. He lives in the present, focusing on "what am I doing today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. He avoids thinking about death, having faced it so many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

His work, particularly *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, has profoundly impacted many individuals' **[[vikrams_personal_and_professional_journey | personal finance journeys]]**, leading to changes in their lives and the lives of their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. He sees himself as teaching "Prosperity happiness money truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. His core message is to "stop working for this [fake money]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> and instead "work for assets" like real estate, Bitcoin, cattle, and oil wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

Dr. Subramanian Swamy, an economist and six-time Member of Parliament, has identified cleaning up [[corruption_in_government | corruption]] in society as a major focus of his current efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He believes that [[corruption_in_government | corruption]] began about 10 years ago and has escalated to a "plunder" of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This money, he claims, is not used for national development but is instead deposited in offshore banks, leading to the country's loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. He expresses disappointment that the BJP, of which he is a part, is not addressing this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Criticism of PM Modi's Leadership and Governance

Dr. Swamy has openly voiced strong [[criticism_of_pm_modis_leadership_and_governance | criticism of PM Modi's leadership]], stating that Modi "tells lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He accuses the Prime Minister of claiming credit for achievements he had no contribution in, such as the Supreme Court clearing the Ram Mandir project, which Dr. Swamy asserts he personally facilitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Further points of [[criticism_of_pm_modis_leadership_and_governance | criticism]] include:
*   **Foreign Policy**: PM Modi's assertion that "nobody has come from China into our territory" is deemed a lie, particularly concerning the alleged occupation of 4,065 square kilometers of undisputed territory in Ladakh by China since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Dr. Swamy questions why Modi remains quiet on this issue and suggests he is being "blackmailed" by the Chinese, though without specifying details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. He also criticizes Modi's [[indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] as lacking clarity, questioning whether India is aligned with or against China, and pointing out the purchase of "junk" from Russia and trading in "Rup Ruble" without proper exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **Internal Party Dynamics**: Dr. Swamy describes the BJP's internal structure as "broken up" under Modi, with everything being nominated by him. He states that only Modi and himself are "genuine members" of the party, implying a lack of internal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. He says Modi selects ministers who "won't have a spine" and will only act if Modi tells them to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. He notes that while some ministers like Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh are capable of speaking up, they are not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Media Control**: Dr. Swamy claims that the media has been "shut up" by the Prime Minister's office, with a "fwa" (edict) issued that no English newspaper in Delhi will publish anything about him. He asserts that for the past four years, "not one line has appeared" about him in English papers, with rare exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Comparisons to Past Regimes**: While Dr. Swamy states that Modi's regime is "much better" than Indira Gandhi's, citing her "sellout to the Russians" and alleged involvement in questionable activities like the railway minister's death and the Emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>, he still sees Modi as having a "dictatorship" mentality that could develop into something extreme, like Hitler or Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

## Economic Policies and Their Impact

As an economist, Dr. Swamy offers specific [[economic_reforms_in_india | economic reforms]] and criticisms of current [[challenges_in_indias_economic_growth | economic growth]]:
*   **GDP and Unemployment**: He asserts that the reported 8-9% GDP growth rate is "bogus" and manipulated, claiming the real growth rate is not more than 4% because it includes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. He states that there has been no decrease in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook**: If PM Modi remains in power, Dr. Swamy predicts India will experience a "massive depression" by 2030, akin to the 1930s United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Specific Policy Criticisms**:
    *   **High Income Tax**: He argues that high income tax rates discourage people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. He advocates for abolishing income tax entirely, believing it would "create a huge new mentality" and encourage people to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. He claims that income tax is primarily collected for the "personal pockets" of income tax officials and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. He notes that the middle and upper-middle classes, who are innovators and educated people, are suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
    *   **High Interest Rates**: Raising interest rates is seen as discouraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
    *   **Ignoring Demand Side**: The government is criticized for focusing on the supply side of the economy while neglecting the demand side, leading to poor demand due to inflation eroding income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. To correct this, he suggests printing notes (not inflationary if it goes to the unemployed who then spend it) and putting money in people's pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>.

## Electoral Bonds Scandal and Transparency

Dr. Swamy labels the electoral bonds system a "mighty scandal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. He states that bankrupt individuals or companies with "dirty money" paid large amounts through these bonds and then received contracts from the government, when they should have been jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. He notes that the story is gaining momentum and more information is expected to come out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. He also mentions the US prosecution of Mr. Adani, implying that Americans have information India does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Overall, he stresses a severe "lack of transparency" in the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

## Congress Party and Allegations of Corruption

Dr. Swamy asserts that from Jawaharlal Nehru's time, there was a deliberate attempt to make Muslims feel safe only with the Congress party, pampering them with "goodies" and preferential police treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. He claims that the Congress ignited most of the Hindu-Muslim riots in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

He is currently prosecuting Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for [[corruption_in_government | corruption]] in the National Herald case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. He describes Sonia Gandhi as "hopeless" and states she has worked for "anti-Indian forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. He claims she bluffed about her education and was unfit to hold any office in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. He states that he and then-President Abdul Kalam stopped her from becoming Prime Minister by finding a technicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>. He also suggests that the Gandhi family remains in [[indian_political_landscape | politics]] to ensure their survival from criminal prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

Regarding Rahul Gandhi, Dr. Swamy calls him an "idiot" who does not seem to genuinely want to be in politics, suggesting he would prefer to "enjoy life in Europe" with stashed money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. He expresses high regard for Rajiv Gandhi, describing him as a "wonderful man" and "man of his word" who was nationalistic and built the Indian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. He contrasts Rajiv Gandhi's "humanity" with other members of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

## Outlook on Indian Politics and Elections

Dr. Swamy believes the BJP will win the upcoming elections, but he hopes PM Modi either does not contest or loses, as he considers Modi "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. He suggests that if Modi is reinstated, he might try to ensure "no more elections for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. He maintains that the BJP could win solely on the "Hindutva issue" without Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

Despite the current challenges, Dr. Swamy remains optimistic about India's future, stating that it will be a "great country" and "potentially the first factor" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. He believes India can overtake China and become one of the top two or three countries within five to six years with the right leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. He stresses the need for more educated, independent individuals in [[indian_political_landscape | politics]] who are not motivated by fear or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

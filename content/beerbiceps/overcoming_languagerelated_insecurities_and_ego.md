Many people seek to learn English fluently and confidently, as well as to [[improving_english_fluency_and_confidence | improve communication skills]] in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While English has always been the speaker's thinking language, they admit that language itself can be a weakness, even for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They used simple tricks to improve their spoken Hindi, believing the same methods apply to English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The key is to make the process easy and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Steps to Improve Spoken English and Confidence

### Step 1: Make it Enjoyable

Forget conventional methods like watching news or joining classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Instead, focus on enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Dedicate a minimum of 15 minutes daily, and ideally up to an hour, to these enjoyable methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **Easy Video Content:**
    *   Watch cartoons, as the language used is simple and designed for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Watch sports commentary, especially by Indian commentators like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, or Harsh Bhogle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Choose any video content you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Audio Content:**
    *   If you prefer listening, tune into the radio or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Simple Reading:**
    *   Read simple English texts, such as a 10th standard ICSE textbook, which often contains short stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Some people learn better through reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The key is to find what you enjoy most and practice it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Step 2: Observe Sentence Construction

Once you've established a habit of consuming English content, focus on observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. You don't need to prioritize learning new vocabulary or big words initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, pay attention to how sentences are constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

*   When you spot differences between how content creators construct sentences and how you naturally think, make a mental note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Recognize these differences as areas for improvement and mentally practice them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Only after grasping sentence construction should you focus on expanding vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This ability to understand spoken English comes from consistent exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Step 3: Put Your Ego Aside

This step is crucial for [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance | building self-confidence]] and [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | overcoming failure]] in language learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Many Indians mistakenly associate English proficiency with intelligence, leading to judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

> "Every time someone make fun of you there's not making fun of you they're making fun of them they're making fun of an insecurity within them if they make fun of your English that means they're conscious about their own English it's a way of boosting their own egos." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

*   **Embrace Mistakes:** It's perfectly fine to make mistakes while speaking English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. If people point out your mistakes, you'll remember them, which aids in improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Focus on Self-Improvement:** Don't concern yourself with what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Instead, focus on becoming the best version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Step 4: Chase Clarity of Thought

Many people struggle with speaking English because they overthink, worrying about "what will people think" or getting stuck in the translation process from their native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. [[spirituality_and_meditation_in_overcoming_fear | Meditation]] is highly recommended to achieve clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> "There is nothing that will clear your mind make your thought process grounded make your thought process clear like meditation will." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

Meditation can help improve every life skill, including language fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Step 5: Stop Giving English So Much Importance

In Indian society, there's a strong misconception that English is associated with intelligence, a legacy of 200 years of British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is a very wrong mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Cultural Pride:** In other countries, people speak their native languages with pride (e.g., German in Germany, Japanese in Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Indians should be proud of their diverse native languages like Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. [[balancing_the_importance_of_english_with_cultural_pride | Balance English with Cultural Pride]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **It's Not a Big Deal:** Not being able to speak English perfectly is truly not a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If you get stuck, feel free to complete your sentences in Hindi or your native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Embrace Your Roots:** Be proud of your own culture and language, the language your forefathers spoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

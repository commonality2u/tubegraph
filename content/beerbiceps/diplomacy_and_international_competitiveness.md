Dr. S. Jaishankar, India's Minister of External Affairs, emphasizes that the world has become increasingly interconnected, leading to a greater public interest in [[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:19">[02:56:19]</a>. He notes that constant global content and comparisons have made everything, from what people consume to what they think, global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## The Role of Diplomacy

Dr. Jaishankar describes himself as a "trained diplomat" whose general standard operating procedure (SOP) is to "keep it cool" and "don't make too many waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:34">[04:37:34]</a>. However, he explains that he has partly transitioned into a political role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. His approach is to be "very nice to people who are nice to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, but when pushed, he believes it's natural to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This "pushing back" is often when [[Indias diplomatic and military stance | India]] is perceived to be pushed or demeaned on the global stage, stating "that 'I' as you rightly said is not me, the 'I' but I the India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Diplomacy, according to Jaishankar, is an "art of detail" involving nuance, body language, and strategic signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. He rarely gets personally offended in meetings, viewing it as "power for the cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. However, if "the collective 'eye' in some way is demeaned or attacked," or if people are condescending or try to ambush, it gets under his skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

### PM Modi's Impact on [[Geopolitics and Indias foreign policy | Foreign Policy]]
Dr. Jaishankar states that under Prime Minister Modi, [[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | India]] is living in a "different era," with Modi being "personally transformational" and having "churned the system in a very, very radical way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Modi possesses the rare quality of combining grand strategic ideas and vision with an attention to minute details, making working with him both interesting and challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## International Competitiveness and Economic Strategy
Dr. Jaishankar highlights that [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitics]] is inherently "money oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:38]</a>. He advises that India must be "fundamentally competitive" in the global arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

>[!INFO] Key to National Competitiveness
>He stresses the importance of developing internal strengths:
> *   Factories and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>
> *   Businesses, startups, and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>
> *   Infrastructure like "smart ports, good roads, the rapid movement of goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to create jobs and opportunities for the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Foreign policy plays a crucial role in this by "marketing India," "branding India," and making India a "magnet" for global business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. This ensures that the rest of the world sees India as "responsible guys," "safe guys" who "are not going to steal your stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

## Navigating a Challenging Global Environment
The current global landscape is described as a "tough place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Dr. Jaishankar outlines various simultaneous challenges:
*   **Health issues:** Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   **Economic consequences:** The Ukraine conflict has led to issues with energy, food, inflation, and fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.
*   **Border problems:** Ongoing issues with [[Chinas internal and geopolitical challenges | China]] on border areas and the "old problem with the Pakistanis" regarding terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen welfare abroad:** Ensuring the safety and support of Indians traveling, working, or studying abroad, including issues like long visa wait times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

He views [[geopolitics_and_indias_foreign_policy | foreign policy]] not as an academic exercise but as something that "actually affects every person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. The focus is on securing and supporting Indian citizens globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

## Technology's Impact on [[Geopolitical strategies and narratives | Geopolitics]]
Dr. Jaishankar acknowledges the profound impact of technology. He explains that individuals are "walking emitters of electronic patterns" through their digital activities (downloads, purchases, consumption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. These patterns, which were previously unseen, are now organized and have become critical in business, politics, and strategy, offering a "fantastic edge" to those who can "mega process patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.

He notes that current geopolitical concerns revolve around "semiconductors" and the "Chip War" or "Tech War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. Chips are considered "the new oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. Diplomatic conversations focus on how countries can cooperate to ensure "trusted collaboration" and create reliable supply chains, especially among "like-minded" market economies and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.

## Talent and the Global Workplace
A key message from Prime Minister Modi, conveyed through Dr. Jaishankar, is to "think of the world as a global workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. This means that work opportunities for Indians can be anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

>[!QUOTE] Dr. S. Jaishankar on Indian Talent
>"Why should a talented Indian be restricted?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>

There is a "huge demand today for trusted talent," particularly for people under 35 who "play by the rules" and understand international business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. India has been actively signing mobility agreements with countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and European nations to facilitate the flow of Indian talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.

The concept of "brain drain" is reframed; the world is seen as a "membrane" where people can "go in and out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>. The traditional idea of leaving India permanently is changing, with people moving for short-term jobs and realizing that opportunities in India can sometimes be better than abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. The example of Apple's manufacturing in India is cited as proof of an improved business atmosphere and the quality of Indian talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>.

## Message to Young Indians and Entrepreneurs
Dr. Jaishankar's message to young Indians, including entrepreneurs, is to have "self-belief" in this "different era" with vast opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. He advises looking at both "big choices" and "practical deep detail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>. He emphasizes that "national choices" and "personal choices" are not divorced, as "a good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>. He believes it is the obligation of leaders to "open that up as much to prepare it as much to create that kind of favorable ground" for the youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>.

For YouTubers and early thought leaders, he states that "leadership can come from a young person" and that experience is not a prerequisite for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.

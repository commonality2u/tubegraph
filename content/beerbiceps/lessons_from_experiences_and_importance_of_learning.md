Giving your 100% effort in anything you do is crucial to avoid future regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. If an endeavor doesn't work out after putting in your best, it's important to accept it and move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This mindset is part of [[dealing_with_failures_and_life_challenges | dealing with failures and life challenges]].

## The Value of Experience

The biggest [[lessons_on_overcoming_lifes_challenges | lesson on overcoming life's challenges]] is to continuously learn and accumulate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The more experience one gains in life, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Experience is distinct from formal education; while some fields like surgery require structured learning, true understanding often comes from personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Learning in your own unique way, or "in your own style," is advocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While the path might be difficult, leading to many perceived "bad" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, it ultimately results in a unique outcome that sets you apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Embracing Experimentation and Growth

Stability, especially in a business like YouTube, requires constant evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This means always trying new things and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Many people fear experimentation due to the possibility of [[failures_as_learning_experiences | failures as learning experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, but it's important to persist and continue to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### The Impact of Pressure

Taking on too much pressure can lead to things going wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. It's beneficial not to dwell on the immense responsibility that comes with a large following, as an individual's perception of numbers (like billions of views) can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Avoiding such pressure helps in maintaining a positive outlook and better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## An Advice on Experiencing Life

The most significant advice is to "experience things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The more experiences one accumulates, the more one grows, regardless of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. It's crucial to never say no to an opportunity and to step out of your comfort zone to experience new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Even if an experience turns out to be negative, it can become a source of amusement and reflection years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. These past incidents, even if they made you "look very stupid," can be remembered with fondness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Ultimately, experiencing things can lead to a discovery that profoundly changes your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Parents also learn and experience new things alongside their children, adapting to new dynamics and situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This shared learning process is part of their own journey of growth and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

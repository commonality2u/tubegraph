The podcast, with over 3,000 videos, 450 podcasts, and eight years of content creation, has become India's most curious podcast, growing by enjoying the journey and continually learning [00:00:00]. The greatest joy for the creators is sharing this knowledge with the audience [00:00:21].

## Podcast Evolution and New Partnership

Efforts have led to the first-ever brand partnership for a self-produced Indian podcast, with TRS now being presented by AIO [00:00:32]. While maintaining the same curiosity, magnanimous guests, and free-flowing conversations, the show introduces a different, more fashionable style [00:00:42].

## Featuring Successful Minds

The podcast is set to host 16 of the most successful minds who have "achieved it in style" [00:00:56]. These 16 epic new episodes will be released over the next few weeks [00:01:02], collectively aiming to teach listeners how to achieve success in style [00:01:13].

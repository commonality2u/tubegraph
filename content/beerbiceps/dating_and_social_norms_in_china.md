The dating scene and social norms in China reflect a blend of traditional values and evolving modern influences, often differing significantly from Western cultures. [[Cultural insights from a Chinese perspective | Chinese people]] are generally described as super shy and less overtly romantic than Indians, tending to prioritize practical aspects like business and money [01:28:39].

## The Dating Scene

### General Characteristics
In general, [[relationships and love | Chinese people]] are not considered very romantic. Instead, they tend to be "more physical on ground" and focus on "business, family, and make money, make money and make money" [01:29:47].

### Generational Differences
*   **Newer Generation (around 18-20 years old)**: Some of the younger generation are more inclined towards hookup culture than serious marriage, a trend that is also observed in the [[the_evolution_of_relationships_and_marriage_over_time | Indian new generation]] [01:30:10]. However, there are also very young individuals "dating, hold each other hand, they say they're going to promise love each other for forever" [01:31:56].
*   **Mary Lee's Generation (1984 born)**: Individuals from this generation tend to focus more on themselves, aspiring to be wealthy and build a better self [01:31:03]. Marriage is often seen as a practical choice for a better life or for a partner who can add value, rather than solely based on love [01:31:17].

## Parental Influence and Expectations
Chinese parents are traditionally strict about dating. During school years, parents do not allow dating, keeping a tight watch on their children, especially girls, to ensure they "don't want to you to to lose the focus for study" [01:32:24]. However, this changes drastically after university graduation, when parents begin to pressure their children, particularly daughters, to get married quickly, asking questions like "when you going to married, when you going to have kids, when we going to have grandchildren" [01:32:56].

## Partner Preferences

### For Chinese Girls
There is a perception among some Chinese men that Chinese girls are "gold digger," primarily seeking money [01:35:10]. However, many Chinese girls genuinely seek "true love, romance" [01:35:30]. While individual tastes vary, the majority of Chinese girls prefer men of their own nationality due to shared [[cultural changes and societal expectations | culture]], communication, and food preferences [01:36:16]. Some Chinese girls have married Indian men, possibly influenced by Bollywood [01:35:51].

### For Chinese Men
Chinese men are generally seen as being very family-oriented, prioritizing their families [01:36:51]. Despite instances of cheating, they tend to put family first, strive to avoid divorce, and aim to provide a good example for their children [01:37:16]. This contrasts with some Western cultures, such as American, where relationships might be more open and family ties less emphasized [01:37:05].

## Comparison with India
In contrast to China, Indians are generally perceived as very romantic and emotional, openly showing affection [01:29:58]. While modern Indian big cities have normalized dating and hookup culture, many Indians still desire long-term relationships and marriage [01:30:17]. Parental pressure for marriage is also prevalent in India, especially for girls, with less pressure on guys until they reach around 30 years old [01:33:14].

## Social Media and Cultural Exchange

### Social Media Platforms
Unlike many other countries that use platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, China has its own equivalents for social media and media consumption:
*   **Douyin (抖音)**: This is the Chinese equivalent of TikTok and is currently the most popular social media platform in China [00:22:24, 03:05:07]. Users outside China must download it from a Chinese Apple Store to see content used in mainland China [00:06:27]. TikTok itself is banned in India due to geopolitical tensions and data security concerns [07:11, 07:24].
*   **Weibo (微博)**: Similar to Instagram, it focuses on pictures, influencers, and celebrity content [00:35:58]. Instagram is banned in China [01:29:40].
*   **Youku (优酷)** and **BiliBili (哔哩哔哩)**: These platforms serve as Chinese equivalents to YouTube, hosting long-form videos, vlogs, and TV series [00:35:14, 01:53:31]. Netflix is also banned, with China having numerous local alternatives [00:35:30].
*   While most foreign apps are banned, Chinese citizens sometimes use VPNs to access global platforms like Instagram [00:36:36].

### Travel and Media Portrayals
There's a mutual curiosity between India and China, with many Chinese people wanting to visit India due to its rich history, nature, and diverse religions [00:38:15]. However, tourist visas between the two countries are currently restricted [00:04:53].

Both Chinese and Indian media often portray the other country from a geopolitical or negative angle, leading to misunderstandings among the general population [00:03:00, 00:31:15, 00:37:00]. There's a call for influencers and travel bloggers to present a more "real" and balanced view of each country to foster positive relations and reduce animosity [01:26:06, 01:28:01].

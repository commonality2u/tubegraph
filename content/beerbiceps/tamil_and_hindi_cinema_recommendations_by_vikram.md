[[Chiyaan Vikrams acting journey and challenges | Chiyaan Vikram]], a superstar in the Tamil film industry, shares his insights and recommendations on both Tamil and Hindi cinema, reflecting on influential films and industry trends.

## Influential Films from Childhood and Teenage Years

From his pre-teen and teenage years, Vikram was deeply influenced by films, particularly those of Kamal Haasan. As a child, he was fascinated by acting, which was solidified by a booklet showing a schoolmaster transforming into different characters with basic makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This inspired his approach to acting, where he aims to be different in every film â€“ not just in appearance, but also in walk, talk, laugh, eating habits, and fighting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

He watched "all of Kamal Haasan's movies" during his 8th, 9th, and 10th grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Rare Hindi films that made their way south were also influential, such as *Sholay* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Recommended Tamil Films

Vikram highlights several Tamil films as must-watches, showcasing the industry's depth and versatility:

### Nayakan (1987)
*   **Director:** Mani Ratnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>
*   **Starring:** Kamal Haasan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Described as a "fantastic film" and "almost like Godfather," it's a beautiful biopic of a gangster that spans different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. Kamal Haasan, at just 34 or 35, convincingly plays a man in his 60s and 70s, making it a classic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Padaharam
*   **Director:** Bharathiraja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>
*   **Starring:** Kamal Haasan, Sridevi, Rajinikanth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Vikram calls it a "very raw film" and "true genre" that offers a rustic glimpse into South Indian village life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. He vividly remembers all its dialogues and praises Kamal Haasan's "Duffer" character performance as something even the actor himself might not be able to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### Raavanan (2010)
*   **Director:** Mani Ratnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Vikram highlights its "very interesting" portrayal of unrequited love and Mani Ratnam's masterful crafting of the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. He praises how Mani Ratnam elicits performances, using evocative imagery rather than direct instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Despite initial struggles due to its connection to the epic Ramayana, it has gained cult status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Vikram expressed pride in his performance in this "tricky" film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Uthiri Pookkal (1979)
*   **Director:** Mahendran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** An "old film" but a "classic" that explores relationships and the consequences when a woman is wronged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

### Pushpak (1987)
*   **Starring:** Kamal Haasan, Amala Akkineni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** A "fantastic silent film" and a comedy. The intriguing aspect was how the story unfolded without a single word of dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

### Ponniyin Selvan (2022)
Vikram acknowledges this film as "an important film from an Indian context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. He agrees with the sentiment that many people of his generation are upset about not being taught enough about the Chola Empire in their childhood, stating that such history could instill pride in every Indian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. He highlights that the Chola Empire had the biggest maritime force in the world, extending to Malaysia and Indonesia, and that practices like karate, kung fu, and Kalaripayattu originated from India but prospered elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Recommended Hindi Films

Vikram also recommends contemporary and classic Hindi films:

### Dil Chahta Hai (2001)
*   **Starring:** Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Mentioned as a film he watched and liked.

### Saa'at or Geeta
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Older films that influenced him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>.

### 12th Fail (2023)
*   **Reason for recommendation:** He found it "damn good" and "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. He particularly loved a scene where the female protagonist supports the male lead's struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>. Vikram called up the director, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, to express his admiration for the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>.

### Laapataa Ladies (2024)
*   **Reason for recommendation:** An "amazing film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>. The host suggests both *12th Fail* and *Laapataa Ladies* show the truth about the masculine and feminine experiences of Indian life, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:13">[01:56:13]</a>.

### Jamtara
*   **Reason for recommendation:** Briefly mentioned as another great film featuring an actor from *Laapataa Ladies* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>.

### David (2013)
*   **Reason for discussion:** While Vikram loved this film, he noted it was not well-received in Tamil cinema due to cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:16">[01:57:16]</a>. He explains that scenes like slapping a woman or a protagonist falling for his best friend's girlfriend, which might be funny or acceptable in Hindi, are not tolerated by Tamil audiences, who expect their hero to be upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>. This highlights the "two very different paradigms" between the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>.

## Insights into the Indian Film Industry

[[Insights on the Indian film industry postpandemic | The Indian film industry has undergone significant shifts, especially post-pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>. Vikram observes a trend where audiences now prefer "large films" and "Larger than Life" experiences like *Pushpa*, *Bahubali*, and *KGF* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:8:40">[02:08:40]</a>. Interestingly, while Hindi films struggle to implement such grandeur without losing audience acceptance, South Indian films are embraced, leading to South Indian directors like Atlee (for Shah Rukh Khan's *Jawan*) working in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:58">[02:58:58]</a>.

However, Vikram also notes that "content-based films are really working right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>, citing films like *12th Fail* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:14">[02:16:14]</a>. This indicates a dual trend in the industry, with both large-scale blockbusters and strong narrative-driven films finding success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. This shift in audience preference and the increasing discovery of Tamil cinema by the wider country highlights a dynamic and evolving landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:43">[02:49:43]</a>.

> [!info] The Art of Character
> Vikram's commitment to [[the_art_of_acting_and_role_preparation_by_chiyaan_vikram | character transformation]] is profound. He details how he fully immerses himself in a role, even in his personal life, for films like *Deiva Thirumagal* (where he played a differentially abled man) and *Sethu* (where he went bald and followed a strict diet). This immersion often leaves him fatigued, both physically and mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. His extreme dedication extends to physical changes, where he transformed his body for *I*, going from a bodybuilder to 52 kg in three months, against doctor's warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:55">[02:21:55]</a>. This dedication, though taxing, ensures his unique presence and contributes to his lasting legacy as an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.

Vikram's [[vikrams_perspective_on_fame_and_personal_growth | acting journey and personal growth]] has been deeply intertwined with his films. His long struggle to achieve recognition, marked by a [[impact_of_a_lifechanging_accident_on_vikrams_career | life-changing accident]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, shaped his humility and appreciation for every role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. His first major success with *Sethu* after a decade of struggle was particularly impactful, creating a deep connection with his audience that he values more than any blockbuster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

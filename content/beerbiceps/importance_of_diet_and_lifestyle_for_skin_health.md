Achieving healthy skin goes beyond topical treatments, with [[Dietary advice for healthy glowing skin | diet]] and lifestyle factors playing a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a>.

## Dietary Factors

Specific dietary adjustments can significantly impact skin health and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>:

*   **Avoid Sugar** Quitting sugar is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a>.
*   **Reduce Processed Foods** It's advised to reduce junk food and restaurant-prepared "hotel kakana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47">[09:47]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Packaged Fried Snacks** Absolutely say no to packaged fried snacks, which often contain "mea" (refined flour), dirty oils, and trans fats that should be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50">[09:50]</a>.
*   **Increase Fruits and Vegetables** Try including a lot more vegetables and fruits in your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>.
*   **Maintain Dietary Balance** Avoid overdoing any particular food type, such as non-vegetarian items, eggs, or even specific vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08">[10:08]</a>.

## Lifestyle Factors

Beyond [[Diet and exercise for overall body health | diet]], lifestyle choices, particularly stress management and sleep, are equally important for skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22">[10:22]</a>:

*   **Stress Management**
    *   High stress levels elevate the hormone cortisol in the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26">[10:26]</a>.
    *   Excessive cortisol negatively affects skin, impacting the aging process, skin quality, and increasing oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>.
    *   To reduce cortisol long-term, focus on sleep hygiene and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>.
*   **Sleep Hygiene**
    *   Focus on the quality of your sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>.
    *   Both meditation and sleep can reduce stress levels and improve skin quality overnight, being as important as other skincare factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>.

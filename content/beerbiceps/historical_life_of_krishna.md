Shri Krishna, a figure revered in [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Hindu mythology]], is explored not merely as a deity but as a historical person who lived approximately 7,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This perspective aims to address misconceptions that India lacks historical records and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The evidence for Krishna's existence is argued to be more substantial than for many well-known world historical figures who lived much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Krishna's Lifespan and Era

[[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] is believed to have lived for 107 or 108 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. He was born around June 27-28, 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. He passed away in 5525 BCE, which was 36 years after the [[Krishna in the Mahabharat and its historical dating | Mahabharata War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The Mahabharata War itself is precisely dated to 5561 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Krishna was approximately 70 to 72 years old when the war was fought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>, being the same age as Arjuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Bhishma, another key figure, was over 140 years old during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

## Krishna's Involvement in the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]]

[[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Krishna]] is a central character in the [[the_mahabharata_and_krishnas_involvement | Mahabharata]], which is the longest epic of humanity, eight times the volume of combining the Greek epics *Iliad* and *Odyssey* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. He enters the story relatively late, meeting the Pandava brothers for the first time when they were 33 years old, during Draupadi's *swayamvar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. He consistently supported the Pandavas, even during their period of exile in the forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Krishna was a significant strategic and statecraft character for the Pandava side in the Mahabharata conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Post-War Events and Literature

After the Mahabharata War, Krishna returned to Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The main Mahabharata text was written by Vyasadeva about 18 years after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Feeling that Krishna's story was not fully covered, Vyasadeva and his team wrote an appendix called *Harivamsha*, which focuses on the genealogy of Hari (Krishna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Still feeling more was needed, he then wrote the *Shrimad Bhagwat Purana*, which describes Krishna's pastimes, glories, and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Evidence for Krishna's Existence

The claim for Krishna's historicity relies on various forms of evidence:

### Celestial Evidence

Ancient texts like the *Harivamsha* and *Mahabharata* contain precise astronomical descriptions that can be simulated using modern software like Voyager 4.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
Specific celestial events mentioned include:
*   A comet spanning 13 *nakshatras* (half the visible sky), so bright it obscured the moon's path, occurring on March 22, 5622 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This was an extremely rare event, not occurring for 10,000 years before or since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   Mercury being visible on the western horizon after sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   A total solar eclipse during the daytime, turning day into night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   Mars (Angarak) in an oblique motion (Vakra) near the Punarvasu *nakshatra* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
These events were prophesied by Kamsa's minister, Andhak, as bad omens before Krishna killed Kamsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

### Terrestrial Evidence

The texts also provide terrestrial descriptions that align with geographical and climatological data:
*   The traditional story of baby Krishna's father, Vasudeva, crossing the Yamuna River during a heavy downpour, with the river waters receding at Krishna's touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. This is contradicted by climate data showing no rain in Mathura during the month of Shravan (the month of Krishna's birth) in the 6th millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   The *Harivamsha* provides an alternative, historically accurate account: Vasudeva walked along the bank of the Yamuna from Mathura to Vrindavan (Ravan) without needing to cross it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   Descriptions of cut tree branches piled up for agricultural burning along village borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a> and Vasudeva stomping on dry cow dung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a> further support a dry season setting, aligning with the actual climate of that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

### Validation Through Ancient Texts and External Historians

*   **Madara's Text**: A text by Madara from the Udupi Matha, *Sri Mahabharat Tatparya Nirnaya*, states that Krishna lived for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This independently corroborates the 108-year calculation derived from celestial and textual evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Megasthenes**: The Greek historian Megasthenes, in his book about India, mentions an Indian tradition of genealogy existing for over 7,000 years, with a figure named Heracles (identified with Krishna) living 13 generations prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Calculations based on this align with Krishna's time in the 6th millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Herodotus**: The "Father of History," Herodotus, in his *History of the World*, describes 341 statues of genealogists in Egypt. Calculating the lifespan of kings (33 years per king) from these statues pushes back Egyptian history to 14,000 years ago, a time when [[Historical evidence for Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] events occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. This suggests connections between Indian and Egyptian cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>, with names like Rameses potentially being derived from Ikshvaku dynasty names like Dasharatha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

## Krishna's Early Life

[[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] was born in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. His maternal uncle, Kamsa, sought to kill him due to a prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Krishna was taken to Vrindavan (Ravan) and raised there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. He killed Kamsa at the age of 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. After killing Kamsa, Krishna reinstated his father, Ugrasena, as king of Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Krishna's Move to Dwarka

Krishna later moved from Mathura to the west coast of India, establishing the kingdom of Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This move was strategic: Mathura's trade through the Yamuna and Ganga rivers was controlled by Jarasandha's kingdom of Patna, where tolls were imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. Jarasandha defeated Krishna and the Yadus 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. To avoid continuous conflict and ensure prosperity, Krishna relocated to Dwarka, which was an ancestral property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. Dwarka, a glorious and prosperous island city with multiple bridges to the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>, was destroyed by rising sea waters in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. The current Dwarka is not the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>; the original was a place called Kusasthali, possibly dating back 30,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

## Krishna's Character and Philosophy

Krishna is considered a "Yuga Purush" or a revolutionary in his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. His path is often described as "Murari," meaning "the path not taken," offering unique solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

### [[Practical life lessons from the Bhagavad Gita | Bhagavad Gita]]
The [[Practical life lessons from the Bhagavad Gita | Bhagavad Gita]], one of the core texts of [[Hindu Mythology and Interpretation as History | Hinduism]], was recited by Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. It serves as a life manual for navigating daily problems and fostering spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Krishna emphasizes the importance of *Jnana* (knowledge), *Shraddha* (faith), and *Karma* (action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. He advocates for a "quadrangulation" of validation:
1.  *Atma pratiti*: Personal understanding and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
2.  *Apta pratiti*: Validation from a trusted authority (e.g., Madara's text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
3.  *Shastra pratiti*: Validation from established scriptures (Mahabharata, Harivamsha, Bhagwat Purana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
4.  *Prakshak Pratiti*: Direct observation and scientific validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

He highlights that knowledge (*Jnana*) without faith (*Shraddha*) can lead to destructive outcomes, while purposeful curiosity (*Saddhaprjna*) is essential for advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. Krishna demonstrates that true Dharma (activity leading to prosperity and ultimate good) can be achieved through practical example, such as his decision to leave Mathura for Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

## Interactions and Relationships

*   **Bhima**: Contrary to popular perception, Bhima is depicted in the Mahabharata as highly intellectual and strategic, capable of anticipating Krishna's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. He is described as having a lean, muscular build ("fox or jackal-like tummy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. Krishna himself expresses that he would have acted as swiftly as Bhima in the Draupadi *Vastrapaharan* incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Bhima also killed Jarasandha, a feat Krishna could not accomplish despite 17 attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
*   **Arjuna and Uddhava**: Krishna had two main disciples, Arjuna and Uddhava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. While Arjuna was powerful, he lost his strength upon hearing of Krishna's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Uddhava, however, remained settled and felt Krishna's presence due to his deeper assimilation of Krishna's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **End of the Yadu Clan**: The Yadu clan, Krishna's lineage, eventually destroyed themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. This is often attributed to Gandhari's curse, but from a pragmatic view, it is seen as a consequence of their excessive prosperity leading to moral decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

## Krishna as Jagat Guru

[[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] is referred to as "Jagat Guru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. This term means not only "guru of the world" (as *Bhagavad Gita* is studied globally) but also "the person who takes the world as his Guru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. Krishna learned from various teachers, including Sandipani and Ghora Angirasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. Notably, he even took a Shaiva *diksha* (initiation) from Shiva, a story told by Krishna himself in the Mahabharata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

In conclusion, [[Krishnas life and teachings | Krishna]] is presented as a verifiable historical individual who lived over 7,500 years ago, whose life was marked by significant events, strategic acumen, profound philosophical contributions, and interactions that shaped the course of ancient India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The speaker recounts a lifelong struggle with fear, particularly the fear of the dark and an unseen presence, which began in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This fear intensified after watching horror movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and persisted into late adolescence, with the speaker unable to sleep alone until around 19 or 20 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The core of this fear was not just a lack of light, but the feeling of an entity always staring at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Childhood Experiences: Sleep Paralysis and a Haunting Figure

The speaker's childhood home, a building with a family-owned hospital on the ground floor and residences on the third, was the setting for these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A significant part of this fear manifested as frequent episodes of sleep paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Understanding Sleep Paralysis
Sleep paralysis is described as a scientific phenomenon where a person half-wakes up while their brain signals the muscular system not to move, a natural protective mechanism to prevent physical reactions to dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. During these episodes, individuals can open their eyes but are unable to move or make a sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In severe cases, nightmares can blend with reality, leading to terrifying hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The speaker's sleep paralysis often included seeing a shadowy figure in their room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### The "Witch" Incident
At the age of 11, while sleeping next to their mother, the speaker experienced a profoundly disturbing sleep paralysis episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This felt "deeper than sleep paralysis," involving shadowy creatures seemingly chaining them to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These creatures appeared to welcome a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A woman with pale, torn, and blistered skin, untidy hair, and one pale red eye, sat on the speaker's chest, staring down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Unable to move or scream, the speaker felt the woman's weight and creepy fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Initial Defense Through Spirituality
Growing up in a [[role_of_spirituality_and_meditation_in_daily_life | spiritual family]], the speaker's mother had taught them a specific mantra to ward off bad spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In that terrifying moment, the speaker closed their eyes and repeated the mantra "Om Nam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They eventually fell asleep and upon waking, the figure was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Later Validation and Embracing Spirituality

Two years later, at age 13, watching a National Geographic show about alien abductions, the speaker witnessed a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This phenomenon, which also involves sleep paralysis accompanied by a "witch sitting on top of you," visually depicted the exact figure the speaker had seen: the same single staring eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, and pale, dead eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This external validation deeply disturbed the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | Spiritual Practices]] as a Path to Overcoming Fear
The speaker eventually grew out of this phobia by discovering [[role_of_spirituality_and_meditation_in_daily_life | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. [[importance_of_spiritual_practices_and_meditation | Spirituality]], beyond meditation and karma, acknowledges a spirit world, astral world, dark energies, and demons, offering methods to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

A core principle adopted was from the "Autobiography of a Yogi": "when you stare fear in the eye it ceases to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This approach helped the speaker overcome their fear of the dark by strengthening their "spiritual muscle of [the] mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Meditation and Collective Energy
Around age 22 or 23, the speaker began meditating frequently, often with their co-founder, Rajas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. They would meditate in darkness for deeper sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. During one late-night meditation session in their building's garage, which felt unusually dark and negative, the speaker recalled the "stare fear in the eye" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. They repeated the "Om Nam" mantra from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Both individuals felt they pushed out a negative energy from the room and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### External Confirmations
*   **Psychic Friend:** A psychic friend visited the speaker's office (within the same building) and immediately went to a specific room, declaring it had a "lot of dark energy" and had hosted a "demon or a ghost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This room was directly beneath the speaker's childhood bedroom where the "witch" incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The psychic suggested their recent [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | meditation]] practices had likely pushed it out, making the environment more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Grandfather's Account:** The speaker's grandfather, who had run the hospital since the 1960s, corroborated these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Patients over 50 years had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night, or even being pushed off their beds by a flash of a scary-looking woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. These incidents occurred in the rooms directly below the speaker's childhood bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
</div>

Currently, the hospital is defunct, and the negative presence is no longer felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. After the psychic's visit, the family performed pujas, havans, and lit candles to further [[the_role_of_meditation_and_spirituality_in_protection | purify and positively impact]] the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that their strong embrace of [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | spirituality]] stems from these experiences, realizing that facing and actively pushing out dark entities through the positivity of [[importance_of_spiritual_practices_and_meditation | spiritual practices]] was key to overcoming deep-seated fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. They believe that spiritual practices help combat occult experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Keeping protein intake high is a key method to [[methods_to_reduce_muscle_soreness | reduce muscle soreness]] after workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. Protein is considered the building block of life, as every cell in the human body is made from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.

## Protein's Role in Muscle Repair and Growth

When muscles are damaged during a workout, such as through micro-tears from activities like bicep curls, the body intelligently prepares itself for future exertion by aiming to become stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>. During the recovery process, the body replaces these broken-down muscle fibers with stronger ones that can withstand greater force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>.

High protein intake provides a steady supply of protein, acting as a constant fuel source for these damaged muscles. This constant supply aids in the creation of stronger muscles for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

## Benefits of High Protein Intake

The higher the protein intake, the better the overall muscle recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. Improved recovery directly leads to better gains and increased muscle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>. Therefore, it is important to prioritize and be serious about protein intake for optimal muscle growth and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>.

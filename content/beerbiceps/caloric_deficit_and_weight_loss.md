Weight loss primarily depends on diet, accounting for approximately 70% to 80% of the overall [[tanmay_bhats_weight_loss_journey | weight loss journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Exercise contributes about 20% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Fundamental Principles of Weight Loss

Successful weight loss is not about following a fixed meal plan from a dietitian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Instead, it involves understanding food science, making informed food decisions, and incorporating enjoyable foods to ensure long-term adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A balanced approach combining fitness and enjoyment is key for sustainable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The sole key to losing weight is the **Caloric Theory**: consuming fewer calories than expended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This requires creating a consistent caloric deficit daily until the target weight is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Weight Loss Scale: Levels of Dietary Commitment

The speed of [[weight_loss_without_exercise | weight loss without exercise]] is determined by the level of sacrifice and adherence to dietary rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The following levels represent different [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | diet strategies for weight loss]], ranging from easier, slower methods to more challenging, rapid approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Each higher level incorporates the rules of the preceding levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Level 1: Minimizing Desserts

The initial step in a [[tanmay_bhats_weight_loss_journey | weight loss journey]] is to minimize or eliminate desserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Desserts are problematic due to:
*   **Sugar:** An addictive substance that triggers a similar brain reaction to cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Dirty Carbohydrates:** Ingredients like maida (refined flour) are not beneficial for the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **High Fat Content:** Fat enhances flavor and makes desserts highly palatable and addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Level 2: Eliminating Vegetarian Junk Food

Beyond desserts, the next step is to cut out vegetarian junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While non-vegetarian junk food may offer some protein, vegetarian options (like *chivda*, *farsan*, *bhaji*, *sev puri*, *pani puri*) are primarily composed of refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If eating out, opt for paneer-based dishes, as they provide protein and are a better choice than most vegetarian junk foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Level 3: Better Carbohydrate Choices

This level focuses on improving carbohydrate choices at home, incorporating principles from levels 1 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Complex (Good) Carbohydrates:** These are difficult for the body to digest, keeping you satiated (full) for longer and leading to fewer calories consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Examples include brown rice, oats, whole wheat, and sweet potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Simple (Bad) Carbohydrates:** These are easily digested, leading to quicker hunger. Examples include white rice, maida, white bread, and potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Replacing simple carbohydrates with complex ones can lead to higher energy levels, prolonged satiety, and improved body composition due to reduced calorie intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Following these first three rules can prevent excess weight gain long-term, especially when mindful of cheat meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Level 4: Indian Paleo Diet

Level 4 introduces diet protocols, specifically an "Indian Paleo" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This is a low-carb diet that avoids all standard carbohydrate sources like rice, potatoes, and wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It includes meat, vegetables, and fruits. Unlike traditional Paleo, "Indian Paleo" also incorporates dals (legumes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. A typical day might involve fruit for breakfast, followed by veggies and non-carb foods for the rest of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Level 5: [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]]

The [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | ketogenic diet]] is an effective, very low-carb diet for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Net carbohydrates (carbs from vegetables and other sources) must not exceed 20 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. In strict keto, carb sources are limited to green leafy vegetables, excluding higher-carb vegetables like carrots and beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This diet can lead to rapid weight loss, with visible transformations in a matter of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Level 6: [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_impact_on_metabolism | Intermittent Fasting]] (IF)

For those who prefer not to follow a low-carb diet, [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_impact_on_metabolism | intermittent fasting]] is another protocol for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Level 7: Combining [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_impact_on_metabolism | Intermittent Fasting]] and [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]]

Combining [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_impact_on_metabolism | intermittent fasting]] with a [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | ketogenic diet]] is an advanced protocol designed for extremely rapid weight loss, potentially resulting in 5 kg lost in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Both protocols accelerate the rate of weight loss, and their combination is considered safe for those committed to following the strict rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This is a very challenging regimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Level 8: Saltless Diet (Temporary, Unhealthy)

> [!warning] This protocol is not recommended for general health and is only suitable for temporary aesthetic purposes, such as photoshoots or specific events, as it involves partial dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The saltless diet is used to shed water weight rapidly over one or two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. It is a common practice before bodybuilding competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This protocol typically involves combining a saltless diet with a diuretic pill and a potassium supplement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The absence of salt, combined with diuretics, drains the body of water, leading to a "paper-thin skin" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This is a dangerous situation and not a healthy practice for sustained weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

In a discussion on college [[entrepreneurship and business ventures | entrepreneurship]], the founders of Slay Point, Gautami and Abhyuday, shared insights into [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | building self-confidence]] and effectively [[utilizing_criticism_and_challenges_for_selfimprovement | handling criticism]] while balancing academic and entrepreneurial pursuits. As young entrepreneurs, they emphasize the importance of self-belief and resilience in navigating the challenges of their digital careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## Building Self-Confidence
Slay Point's founders highlighted that [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance | believing in themselves]] is a recent but significant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. They initially felt self-limited, thinking they "can't do this" or "can't do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. However, after trying, they realized these perceived limitations were normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This newfound self-belief emerged recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:35">[09:12:35]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges
One instance of [[overcoming_challenges_in_early_career | overcoming challenges]] that boosted their confidence was when YouTube asked them to host a red carpet event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:42">[06:01:42]</a>. Despite initial disappointment and reluctance about speaking on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:04">[06:06:04]</a>, the experience significantly boosted their confidence in public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:49">[06:14:49]</a>. They learned the importance of speaking to others and how to interact with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:04">[06:19:04]</a>.

### Practical Skills and Education
The founders attest that YouTube has provided them with a greater education than their college in terms of practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>. They have gained valuable skills in talking to brands, managing finances, and understanding business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:30">[02:53:30]</a>. These acquired skills, such as digital marketing and agency work, mean they are already equipped for job roles with competitive salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:09">[05:17:09]</a>.

## Handling Criticism
Dealing with pressure and criticism, and learning to ignore negative opinions, has been one of the most valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:02">[06:32:02]</a>.

### Parental Doubts
Initially, their parents viewed their YouTube activities as merely "posting memes on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. The most demotivating comments from their parents included sentiments like, "it's not going to last anyway, so why put so much effort?" or "it's not going to be fruitful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:20">[03:25:20]</a>. Parents also questioned their understanding of running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

While demotivating, one founder noted that they understood their parents' concerns, as any parent would be worried about an uncertain career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>. They chose to prove their parents wrong over time by showing them brand deals, income, and their growing fan following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:14">[03:58:14]</a>. Despite evidence of success, parents tend to maintain a grounded approach, not overtly showing pride to keep their children humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:08">[04:12:08]</a>. Parents also frequently question the longevity of their fame and what they will do if views decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:09">[04:46:09]</a>. Their answer is that the accumulated industry knowledge and business experience will allow them to expand into related fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:50">[05:06:50]</a>.

### Dealing with Haters and Peer Jealousy
On YouTube, facing "hundreds of people" who may hate your content is inevitable, and it's impossible to please everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:40">[06:41:40]</a>. They also acknowledged that "haters" aren't just online but can also be friends who are jealous and indirectly undermine one's self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:44">[09:02:44]</a>.

## Overcoming Mental Blocks and Perceptions
Young entrepreneurs often face a [[promoting_selfconfidence_and_selfacceptance | lack of self-confidence]], partly due to the perception of being "too young" and lacking experience compared to older individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:41">[08:20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:37">[08:30:37]</a>. This faulty perception can be a mental block, hindering their ability to think big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:49">[07:50:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:41">[08:17:41]</a>. They learned that some older individuals might not necessarily know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:07">[08:39:07]</a>. External opinions, including those of jealous friends, can also lead to self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

Slay Point's journey highlights several key points for young people:
*   **Prioritization and Scheduling**: It's crucial to make a proper schedule and prioritize tasks, whether academic or professional, giving equal importance to what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:41">[03:33:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:19">[09:54:19]</a>. Their marks even increased after starting YouTube because they learned to make the best use of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:33">[10:49:33]</a>.
*   **Dedication**: Giving one's all to chosen commitments, whether studies or creative work, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:06">[10:04:06]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Through balancing YouTube and college, they learned to accomplish more in shorter periods, a valuable life skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:51">[11:13:51]</a>.
*   **Learning by Doing**: They didn't learn formal skills like acting or camera work; instead, they learned everything with time because they were interested in making content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:54">[11:55:54]</a>. Anyone with interest can learn what's needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:39">[12:00:39]</a>.

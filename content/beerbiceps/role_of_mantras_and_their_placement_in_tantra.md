Mantras serve as a fundamental element in Tantric practices, acting as specialized divine chants to connect with a specific deity or "deata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. These spiritual sounds are considered crucial for fostering a profound connection and furthering one's spiritual journey.

## Origination of Mantras
Mantras are believed to be "seen" by ancient seers known as "Rishis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. These extraordinary beings perceive the mantras, which then become the kernel of truth, working for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Rishis are considered souls of a very high order who incarnate to form a link between the spiritual and material worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Types of Mantras
Mantras can broadly be categorized:
*   **Meaningful Mantras** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>: Some mantras have a direct, discernible meaning.
*   **Bija Mantras (Seed Mantras)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>: These are like a "capsule" or "seed" of the deity's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. They may not have a direct meaning but possess a phonetic power that creates an energy resonating with a specific deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. An example of a Bija Mantra for Mahakali is "Krim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

## Mantra Sadhana and Nasas
In [[dakara_tantra_practice_and_initiation | Dakara Tantra practice]], "Mantra sadhana" (spiritual practice involving mantras) is a core component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>. This involves the repetition ("japa") of mantras, often counted using a "japamala" (rosary beads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

A unique aspect of Tantric mantra practice is "Nasas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, which involves placing mantras in different parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This is done by chanting specific mantras and touching certain body parts repeatedly over months and years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The goal is to purify the body through the resonance of these mantras, which is believed to help the deity approach the practitioner faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This process can be likened to a "spiritual tattoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, where the body becomes imbued with the mantra's energy.

## The Role of a Guru and Initiation
For certain Tantric practices, especially those involving Shakti mantras and Bija Mantras, a formal "diksha" (initiation) from a qualified guru is mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Shakti mantras work with "tremendous speed" and cause rapid changes in the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Without proper guidance, practitioners may face challenges or negative experiences if they cannot navigate or "digest" the intense energies triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. The guru provides crucial guidance on how to safely integrate these experiences into one's life and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

The importance of a guru is so profound that even Lord Krishna, considered a divine being, had gurus to learn various arts and Vedas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. Only Lord Shiva is considered "swayambhu" (self-existent) and without a guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

## Secrecy of Practices
From certain stages of Tantra, particularly in [[dakara_tantra_practice_and_initiation | Dakara Tantra]], secrecy becomes important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These practices should not be performed in front of those who are not meant to see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Traditional authorities even advise that when performing mantra sadhana, one should not utter the mantra out loud to the extent that someone nearby could hear it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. This is because speaking it aloud can dissipate the energy being cultivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

The secrecy is not "gatekeeping" but rather a filter to ensure that the knowledge is shared only with those who display the "fitness" and capability for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Mantras
The speaker shares a personal experience where, after performing an "anushthan" (a concentrated form of upasana) for the Divine Mother, they received a full mantra in a dream, which repeated twice for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Initially, the speaker resisted due to the intensity of the specific "mahavidya" (form of the Divine Mother) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>, as such practices should not be done without proper guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. However, the vivid repetition of the dream led to starting the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>, which later unexpectedly led to an [[role_of_devas_and_cosmic_beings | experience of Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. This highlights how sincere mantra practice can open unforeseen spiritual paths.

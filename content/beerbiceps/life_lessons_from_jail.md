Despite the difficulty, he does not regret it, stating that he [[learning_from_failures | learned from it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. He emphasizes that one must [[the_importance_of_learning_through_experience | learn from whatever you go through in life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. His experience in jail did not break him, as he had already experienced similar strictures in boarding school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

*   Gardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
*   Making paper bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>
*   Washing his own room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>
*   Taking cold showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>

He also learned to work out with free hand exercises, boxing, and running within his cell's yard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

## Spiritual and Philosophical Growth

His time in jail also fostered deep spiritual and philosophical [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>:
*   He read extensively, including the Ramayana, Shiv Puranas, and Ganesh Puran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   From reading the Shiv Puranas, he gained [[learning_and_insights_from_podcast_episodes | insights]] into Lord Shiva's power, humility, and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### The Lesson of "Stop Hoping"
One of the most significant [[practical_life_lessons_from_the_bhagavad_gita | lessons]] came from a spiritual figure ("dadhi"), who advised him to "stop hoping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Sanjay Dutt initially found this difficult, as people constantly hope for things like a good interview or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. However, after about two or three months of trying, he stopped hoping for things like his wife's visits or government relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. He recounts that the day he stopped hoping, he was released from jail, a principle he has carried into his life ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

This concept resonates with Buddha's teaching that "expectations are the source of all suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a> "That was one of the biggest lessons for me which I want to tell the people who are hearing this, stop hoping, and everything will come to you because the day I stopped hoping, the next thing I knew I was out of jail."

## Maintaining Humility
Sanjay Dutt states that he has always been humble, and his time in jail did not break him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. He emphasizes that one cannot pity oneself, but rather must be a fighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. He encourages others to be strong and face life's problems head-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

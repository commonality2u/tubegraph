Janhvi Kapoor has openly discussed her journey of self-discovery, challenges with public perception, and how she navigates her career with authenticity and introspection. She strives to define herself on her own terms, rather than conforming to external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

## Navigating Public Perception and Authenticity

Kapoor acknowledges that her "true vibe" is often only understood by those who meet her in person, suggesting a disconnect between her public image and her actual personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. She recognizes that she possesses more depth than people initially perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

She struggles with the idea of being viewed as a "brand," a concept she finds difficult to embrace, despite being told it's a "shortcoming" in her profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This difficulty stems from the pressure to present a simple, identifiable image to the audience, such as:
*   "The girl that wears the saramies and goes to the temples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>
*   "The girl that wears like skimpy clothes outside the gym" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>
*   "The Dy girl that says inappropriate things in interviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>
*   Someone dedicated to her craft, even to the point of injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>

Kapoor asserts that she is "all of these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, highlighting her multifaceted identity and her desire to present her authentic self. She notes that "giving less and less of a [care] about what I'm putting out" has "throwing people off a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, but it's a necessary step in her journey to "find out who I am for myself more than for others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. This shift towards self-discovery intensified after the COVID-19 pandemic, which "sped up this process of like realigning your priorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

## Insecurities and Self-Doubt

Despite her public persona, Kapoor reveals deep-seated insecurities. Her biggest insecurity is the fear that she might be "as little as people think of me or I am as limited as they would imagine me to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. This self-doubt is rooted in lifelong experiences with the "nepotism debate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

From school age, she faced remarks implying her success was due to her parents' fame, rather than her own merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This constant external validation of her worth led her to "question what you have to offer in this World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

Kapoor prefers to be "underconfident" rather than "delusional" about her success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. She views this as a protective mechanism, believing that arrogance can lead to complacency and stagnation in one's art and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Personal Characteristics and Insights

Kapoor identifies herself as a "curious person" who enjoys reading, traveling, and observing people, whom she sees as "walking talking Encyclopedia of their own experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. She loves listening to people discuss their passions and identifies as a "feeler" and an "empath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Her acting background contributes to her enjoyment of seeing people's eyes light up when they speak about things they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

She also describes herself as having a "dark side" and being "very open to Twisted conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>, although she does not delve into this further in the discussion.

Kapoor is a Pisces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a> and suggests that the host, a Gemini, shares a "purist" trait, always "in search for the truth" and averse to pretense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>. She believes Geminis "strive for clarity a lot" and "have two sides to themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.

## Reflecting on Family Influence and Legacy

Kapoor acknowledges the role of her family in her upbringing, particularly her "education" gained from travelling with her mother and being on her father's film sets, learning about respecting time, different cultures, and the emotional intelligence required in an artistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Her love for films is a significant driving force, especially after losing her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

She attributes characteristics like her energy and approach to life to her maternal lineage, stating, "It's in my mitochondria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. While she feels her voice, mannerisms, and sensitivity are similar to her mother's, she finds it challenging to draw parallels openly due to public perception of her mother as "Sridevi Kapoor" rather than just "my mom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:14:00">[46:14:00]</a>. She believes her mother stood for "dignity and innocence," remaining childlike and naive in the industry, which kept her art "uncorrupted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>.

From her father, Boney Kapoor, she has gained a strong work ethic, describing him as a "hustler" who is resilient and values honesty in work, dealings with people, and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>. Her father and his brothers grew up in Chembur, where they were considered the "less affluent" Kapoors, which instilled in him the need to "hustle more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>.

## Current Outlook

Kapoor is currently single and admits to feeling lonely at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>. She feels that intimacy has become too accessible, making people "too scared to commit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>. She prefers to focus on her career and personal growth, stating, "I've wasted too much of my energy on people that didn't deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:36:00">[52:36:00]</a>. She desires "more films, more experiences, more growth, and more love from the audience" over a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>.

Regarding her new film, *Good Luck Jerry*, she explains it's about a girl who appears innocent but has a dark side, and learns to embrace all aspects of herself, much like [[Priyanka Chopras perspectives on fame and public perception|Janhvi Kapoor]] herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>.

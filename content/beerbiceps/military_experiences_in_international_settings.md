Colonel Rajiv Ban has served the [[challenges_and_success_in_international_career | Indian Army]] in various capacities both within India and internationally, offering unique perspectives on [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat experiences]], humanitarian challenges, and the nature of military service. He describes his professional life as being proud to be a "portal for military story like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Service in Africa: United Nations Peacekeeping Operations

Colonel Ban was deployed to Africa as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, specifically in Abay, which is located in what is now North and South Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. His experience there was profoundly impactful due to the extreme conditions and human suffering.

### Harsh Realities of Abay, Sudan
The region was characterized by absolute barren terrains with zero productivity, no crops, and no business activity, relying heavily on provisions from the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Life had no value, and people were "mad for no reason," possessing sophisticated weapons despite having nothing to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. Colonel Ban witnessed unimaginable scarcity, where water was more expensive than oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, and people would kill for a single loaf of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. He observed locals drinking cow's blood to quench their thirst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a> and eating boot polish and medicines from garbage disposal areas just to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. The political instability led to a state where militant groups were rampant, often engaged in brutal acts, including chopping off heads and playing football with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.

### Hostage Situation and Negotiation
In one particularly intense situation, two officers and thirty men from another contingent were taken hostage by a militant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Colonel Ban, as part of the reserve battalion, was tasked with negotiating their release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. Accompanied by his highly trained team, he landed in an environment with two attack helicopters and hundreds, if not thousands, of armed and irrational individuals firing into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

Despite the immense pressure, Colonel Ban decided to approach the situation unarmed (after telling his team to put their weapons aside) and with a smile, using a traditional greeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Fortunately, the leader of the group knew English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Colonel Ban conveyed a message of respect and a subtle warning about the capabilities of his trained soldiers, ultimately persuading the "warlord" to disperse his men to create a more amicable environment for a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. This negotiation resolved the situation without a single bullet being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

### Humanitarian Aspect
Colonel Ban often defied orders to not give water or food to anyone outside the protected area, quietly distributing his own share to suffering locals, especially children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. He highlights the stark difference between "challenges" experienced in operations and the "suffering" of the people in Sudan, calling the latter "painful" and "meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. In one instance, he chose to open the gate of their camp to provide shelter to an old man with an amputated leg, a small child, and an old lady, despite orders not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. He felt it was better to face punishment than abandon those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.

## Experiences in Conflict Zones: Kashmir
Colonel Ban also served in [[experiences_in_conflict_zones_like_kashmir | Kashmir]], experiencing the complex ground realities. He notes a significant difference between what is shown in media and the actual situation on the ground, encouraging international audiences to visit Kashmir as tourists to understand it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.

He recounts seeing signs in Srinagar saying "Indian army and dogs are not allowed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a> and Pakistani flags, indicating the strong anti-India sentiment prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. He highlights the difficulty of transporting fallen soldiers' bodies when routes were blocked by protestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. However, he believes that the revocation of certain sections has made a significant positive difference, leading to a "cleaner" environment, symbolized by the presence of the Indian flag (Teranga) at Lal Chowk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. He asserts that Indian soldiers are the "best brand in the entire world" for their capability to fight and survive on minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

## Learning from Experiences
Colonel Ban emphasizes the importance of maintaining composure in [[leadership_and_responsibility_in_intense_combat_situations | high-pressure situations]]: "if you can maintain your nerves in such situation, that is what matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. He believes a soldier is defined "by heart, not by uniform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>, advocating for individuals to contribute to their nation in any capacity. While acknowledging the difficulty and emotional toll of his experiences, especially the suffering witnessed in Sudan, he focuses on carrying forward only positive lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. He stressed that experiences like those in Sudan highlight the importance of basic resources, as seen in his anecdote about showing students pictures of people drinking cattle urine to teach them about food and water wastage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

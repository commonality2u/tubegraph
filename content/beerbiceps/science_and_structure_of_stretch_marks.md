Stretch marks are damage marks or lesions on the body, appearing in areas with slightly higher fat percentages such as the chest, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Initially, they manifest with a red or purple color before transitioning to a white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While in their red or purple form, stretch marks are more treatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

It is important to note that most human beings deal with stretch marks, and it is a very normal issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Every single human being is prone to getting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Skin Structure and Stretch Mark Formation

Understanding the structure of the skin is crucial to comprehending stretch marks. The skin consists of three primary layers:
1.  **Epidermis:** The outer layer of the skin, whose main function is protection from the external world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
2.  **Dermis:** The middle layer of the skin, which is where the problem of stretch marks arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its main function is to give structure to the skin, specifically its pliability (ability to stretch) and elasticity (ability to retain its original shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Stretch marks occur within this dermis layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
3.  **Hypodermis:** The innermost layer, responsible for insulation as it contains the fat layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### The Role of Fibroblasts, Collagen, and Elastin

The key to understanding why stretch marks happen lies in specific cells and fibers:
*   **Fibroblast:** This is a type of cell in the body that serves as an origin cell for connective tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Collagen and Elastin Fibers:** These connective tissues originate from fibroblasts and are essential for giving the skin its structure, elasticity, and pliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Stretch marks affect some people more than others because those individuals have a lesser degree of collagen and elastin fibers, which means they also have a lesser degree of fibroblasts in their body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The core reason stretch marks occur is that the body is producing fewer fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Causes of Fewer Fibroblasts

There are two primary reasons for the production of fewer fibroblasts:
1.  **Genetics:** Some individuals are genetically prone to having fewer fibroblasts than normal, making them more susceptible to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
2.  **Stress:** This is a more common reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. When stressed—whether from mental stress (e.g., work, studies) or physical stress (e.g., over-exercising)—the body produces more of a hormone called cortisone, which is the stress hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Elevated cortisone levels negatively affect the formation of fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

A higher degree of cortisone leads to lesser fibroblasts, which in turn means lesser collagen and elastin fibers, ultimately resulting in more stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### How Stretching Causes Damage

Stretch marks happen because the skin is being stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. When there are fewer collagen and elastin fibers, the skin gets damaged instead of returning to its original shape when stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The concept of divine beings, or devas, is central to various spiritual traditions, particularly in Hinduism. These beings are understood to exist in realms beyond human comprehension, often predating the material world and playing a crucial role in spiritual evolution and cosmic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Origin and Nature of Devas
From a practitioner's perspective, the origin of devas is rooted in ultimate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

*   **Adi Shakti / Parashakti:** The ultimate form of energy is known as the [[Mahakal and its spiritual significance | Divine Mother]] or Adi Shakti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Her origin is unknown and beyond mental comprehension, akin to a scientific singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This energy reveals itself only to those with the capacity and state to perceive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Parashiva:** In another scheme, this ultimate force is called Parashiva, a being whose nature is not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Formless vs. Formed:** There are two stages of existence: formless and formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The formless is not inherently higher or lower than the formed; they are merely two phases of one energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Descent into Creation:** From the Adi Shakti or Parashiva, energy evolves downwards into creation, forming the deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. These great Gods are given their own domain and independence to function, similar to different cars running on the same fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Absolute Independence (Swatantra):** The great force that creates the world is absolutely independent, unlike humans whose independence is contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This force curtails itself to create the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Eternal Existence:** Devas are considered eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Even if all life on Earth were to disappear, the devas would still exist, having been present for a very long time and remaining until dissolution and the start of a new cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Role in Spirituality and Human Life

Devas are intrinsically linked to spiritual practices and guide humanity in various ways.

*   **Worship and Connection:** Average human beings benefit greatly from worshiping devatas, as each is deeply connected to the ultimate source and can guide individuals to higher states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Tithis:** Deities have specific likings for certain Tithis (lunar days), when their energies become more active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. For example, [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava's]] energy is most active on Krishna Paksha Ashtami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Upasana (Worship):** Upasana is described as a "love affair" where the devotee (upasaka) tries to please the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This can involve mantra chanting, meditation, drawing yantras, or offering Bada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. The goal is for the deity to take notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Tendency and Past Lives:** A natural tendency towards a specific deity can arise from worshiping them in past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Even if born into a different culture, one might feel a connection upon encountering that deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Guidance and Intervention:** Devas can guide individuals, sometimes through intuitive communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Karma and Purpose:** Human life is often a reaction to past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. A specific purpose in life emerges when one has pursued an aim for multiple lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Greatness achieved in this world is often the result of wishes and efforts from two or three previous lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   **Hard Work:** Nothing good is achieved without hard work, including spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. Genuine spiritual growth, even if sudden, is a result of work in past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.
*   **Pain as a Catalyst:** The divine may force individuals through pain to create a visceral cry for help, leading to spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:00]</a>. Pain is seen as necessary for growth, similar to fire testing gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[57:20:00]</a>.

## Specific Devas and Cosmic Beings

### [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]] and His Forms

*   **Shava Siddhanta:** A dualistic worship of [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]] prevalent in South India, where there is a clear distinction between the worshiper and the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
*   **Rudra Agamas:** These texts describe how to worship Rudra, with an equation that is partially monistic and partially dualistic, acknowledging both difference and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.
*   **[[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]] Agamas:** These texts describe [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Shiva]] in his form as [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]], which is monistic, meaning the devotee will eventually become one with the deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>.
*   **[[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]]'s Nature:** The word [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]] means terrifying, because he is an unconditioned truth that forces individuals to face their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>. He is a guardian who protects his upasaka very strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. He is also considered the guru of Tantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:10]</a>.
    *   **Vatuka [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]]:** A child-like form of [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]] who is very fast to respond to prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

*   **Kala [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]]:** Emerged from [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]]'s anger when Brahma made disparaging remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. He cut off one of Brahma's heads, incurring the sin of Brahmahatya, which he then carried to demonstrate penance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:50">[02:13:50]</a>. He is considered the permanent resident of Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>. He is heterodox and often associated with cremation grounds and spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:02">[02:18:02]</a>.
*   **64 Bhairavas:** Rudra Tantra mentions there are 64 [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairavas]], with 8 of them being very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:44">[02:09:44]</a>. These Ash Bhairavas guard specific directions and realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:42">[02:10:42]</a>.

### Nagas and Serpents
Snakes hold significant symbolism and power in spiritual traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

*   **Symbolism:** Snakes are seen with [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]] around his neck, [[role_of_lord_vishnu_and_different_avatars | Vishnu]] lying on [[role_of_lord_vishnu_and_different_avatars | a snake]], and goddesses with snakes as girdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. They represent a peculiar energy that is powerful and superlative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Nagas:** These are powerful reptilian beings with occult powers and abilities, capable of manifesting siddhis (special powers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. They are naturally drawn to those with serious spiritual energy, often acting as protectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.
    *   **Yoga Sutras:** The [[concept_of_reincarnation_and_spiritual_beings | yoga]] sutras are believed to have come from the Nagas, with Patanjali himself considered a Naga or [[role_of_lord_vishnu_and_different_avatars | Sheshnag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. Their knowledge is often too intense for average human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.
    *   **Hidden Existence:** Nagas are believed to still exist but are hidden in their own domains, only appearing to those with sufficient spiritual proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>.
    *   **Naga Mani:** It is believed that certain Nagas develop a jewel in their head called a Naga Mani, which, if found, can cause rapid positive changes in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.
*   **Ordinary Snakes:** Not all snakes are spiritual entities; some are normal animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>. However, harming snakes, especially poisonous ones, is considered problematic and can lead to strong repercussions in one's life due to karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.
*   **Kundalini Shakti:** The serpentine imagery of the Kundalini Shakti is derived from the coiled snake rising with its hood open when fully manifested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.

## Higher Realms and Evolution

Spiritual growth allows individuals to access higher realms and transcend normal human limitations.

*   **Nirvana as a Door:** [[concept_of_reincarnation_and_spiritual_beings | Nirvana]], often considered the end of the spiritual journey, is also seen as a door to other, even higher realms of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>.
*   **Transcendence of Ego:** [[concept_of_reincarnation_and_spiritual_beings | Nirvana]] cannot be attained without transcending the ego, which is the root of individual identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:18">[01:57:18]</a>. While ego is necessary for functioning in the world, spiritual growth involves moving beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.
*   **Beyond Physical Form:** At very high spiritual stages, the physical body may not be able to hold the energy, requiring one to leave the body, yet becoming even more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. These beings become almost indistinguishable from [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:34">[01:47:34]</a>.
*   **Chakras and Adesh:** Beyond the six functional chakras, there are more dormant chakras that can be activated through Kundalini Shakti. Upon activation, a specific chakra can lead to receiving an "Adesh" (command) from a Divine Guru who resides in higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

*   **Mahasiddhas:** These are individuals who have gone beyond the normal conception of [[concept_of_reincarnation_and_spiritual_beings | Nirvana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. They can enter the state of [[concept_of_reincarnation_and_spiritual_beings | Nirvana]] without extinguishing themselves from the system, often because nature has a higher plan for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>. These beings can guide others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Other Aspects

*   **Kashmir Shaivism Tattvas:** In Kashmir Shaivism, there are 36 Tattvas (stages of realities), extending beyond the 24 Tattvas recognized in other philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. Even beyond Maya, there are deeper layers of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Sudha Vidya:** A pure realm beyond the 24 Tattvas where seven crore mantras given by [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava | Shiva]] exist to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Mantras (Bij mantras):** Certain strong words in Tantric mantras, known as Bij mantras, are believed to have originated from Rishis and possess specific potency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>. For example, "Hreem" is a Maya Bij mantra that destroys Maya and gives vision beyond it, connected to [[Mahakal and its spiritual significance | Goddess]] Bhuvaneshwari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The Bij mantra "Phat" is used to stop or end negative forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:46">[02:27:46]</a>.
*   **Animals and Spirituality:** All animals possess an innate spiritual instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>. Dogs, for example, have a strong instinct for loyalty and are considered the vahan (vehicle) of [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>. Dogs are believed to have lived with humans since [[Bhairava worship and Shivas avatars | Bhairava]] decided to help the species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:37">[02:04:37]</a>.
*   **Monotheism vs. Polytheism:** Dharma does not adhere to monotheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:43">[01:48:43]</a>. Even when worshiping one deity, other associated deities are always present, forming a "Parivar" (family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. These associated beings are often the first to interact with a devotee as they progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The human mind is the most peculiar thing, having all sorts of desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. To understand a person's secret motivations, one should observe their actions rather than their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

[!WARNING]
It is important to remember that spiritual teachings at very high levels are not meant for ordinary people and can be misunderstood if one's energy is not sufficiently developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

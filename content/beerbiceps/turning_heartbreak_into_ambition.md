KL Pand, a prominent figure in the Indian YouTube fashion industry, shares her [[personal_journeys_and_overcoming_failure | personal journey]] of [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | overcoming setbacks]] and leveraging heartbreak to achieve significant professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Early Struggles and a Pivotal Heartbreak

In her early twenties, KL Pand faced academic challenges, experiencing three or four backlogs in her exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She failed one exam and deliberately chose not to take two others due to a demanding relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. At one point, amidst a major fight with her then-partner, her anxiety led her to skip an exam to try and reconcile the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This attempt failed, resulting in her failing the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

This period was marked by significant heartbreak and rejection, which she describes as "sad dark times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Her first major heartbreak occurred at age 20 or 21, stemming from a four-year-long relationship that left her feeling devastated and shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Transforming Pain into Purpose

Faced with the choice to either emerge stronger or let the pain consume her, KL Pand consciously decided to transform her heartbreak into [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | ambition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She resolved to channel her [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | passion]] into a profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

One day, she woke up and decided she no longer wanted to feel that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. She asked herself what would make her happy, and the answer was fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Realizing that pursuing chartered accountancy would not alleviate her pain, she informed her parents that she needed to prioritize herself and pursue her true desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### The Power of Belief and Attraction

KL Pand emphasizes that her success came the moment she started believing in herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. She believes in the Law of Attraction, stating that if one truly desires something, the universe will assist in achieving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Maintaining Motivation and Purpose

Despite her success, KL Pand continues to work tirelessly, driven by [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | passion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. She enjoys waking up with a motive and a purpose in life, which she strives to fulfill with high-quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This inherent drive prevents her from simply relaxing, even when she has achieved financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Independence

A significant step in her [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | growth journey]] was moving out of her parents' home and living independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. She views living alone as a crucial part of adulting, as it fosters independence through responsibilities like paying bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This autonomy, including building her own home from scratch, provides a profound sense of self-worth and helps her overcome feelings of being low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Future Endeavors: Self-Love and [[balancing_career_success_and_personal_wellbeing | Wellbeing]]

Looking ahead, KL Pand aims to improve her self-love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. She acknowledges that she doesn't completely love herself yet and is actively working towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Her goal is to reach a stage of self-fulfillment where external factors like work performance or relationship issues do not affect her overall self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Approach to Professional Insecurity

While some YouTubers grapple with insecurity due to constant public metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, KL Pand has never been obsessed with numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. She prioritizes inner peace over external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. She believes that one's work or relationships should be a *part* of life, not the *entirety* of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. For KL Pand, relationships hold a higher priority than her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Her current relationship has been a significant support system, with her partner, Ravit, helping her believe in her potential to become a YouTuber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. A strong relationship provides a crucial escape and support system for those in demanding professions like YouTube, which are often volatile and high-pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Advice for [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | Overcoming Setbacks]]

When advising others on taking risks, KL Pand advocates for a calculative and logical approach rather than impulsive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. However, she also cautions against overthinking to the point of inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Her greatest strength lies in her ability to [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | bounce back]] from adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. She believes that even if she lost everything, her passion would enable her to work her way back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

[[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karma]] is directly connected to time, with time controlling karma in the human world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:03">[06:05:03]</a>. Like nature, time will also change, influencing karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. It's a fundamental law of nature: what goes up comes down, and what goes down goes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## The Soul's Journey and Energetic Blueprint
This is not our first lifetime; on average, individuals living in this age have experienced at least 50 to 500 lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Before incarnating, every soul creates a master plan or "blueprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This energetic blueprint exists in an "energy language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While individuals may forget their purpose due to societal distractions, the soul remembers and constantly guides them through intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The soul's journey involves learning lessons, resolving past life connections, and evolving to a higher frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

The [[the_metaphysical_understanding_of_karma_and_reincarnation | akashic record]] stores the sum totality of a soul's experiences across all lifetimes, including virtues, weaknesses, and future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This record acts as a life plan, detailing the people to meet, lessons to learn, and experiences (both highs and lows) to undergo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Incomplete aspects from previous lifetimes are carried forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Types of Karmic Interactions
Akashic records can be broken down into three parts:

### Karmic Contracts
These are symbiotic relationships with people such as parents, partners, colleagues, employees, teachers, and friends, where individuals add to each other's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. These contracts are often eternal, meaning paths may reconnect even after long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. When you need something, you attract the energy of the person who can provide it, fulfilling a part of the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Karmic Lessons
These relationships are short-lived, serving to teach a specific lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. If the lesson is learned, that type of person or energy will not reappear in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. However, if the lesson is not learned, another person will arrive to teach the same lesson, often in a harsher way, leading to repeated patterns and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. These lessons are painful and short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Karmic Incompletions
These are tasks or experiences left unfinished in previous lifetimes that a soul may choose to complete in the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. While suffering can be a result of past actions, new contracts and lessons are also picked up in each lifetime, facilitating evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Understanding Karma and the Nature of Suffering
Souls may choose to incarnate into human form, but this binds them to space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Humanity experiences maximum suffering compared to other spiritual realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Souls are sent back to human form to finish incomplete karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### The Five Exit Points
Every soul has five "exit points" or periods of potential death during its human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. A soul can choose to accept an exit point if content with achievements, or continue if more work is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. However, skipping an exit point and choosing to remain on Earth will cause sufferings and challenges to increase, leading to more karmas and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. If a soul becomes extremely attached and passes all five exit points, the body may become a "vegetable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Accidental deaths can also be self-chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Souls of high frequency often know when something is going to happen to them, allowing them to take their first exit point peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Conversely, in severe accidents where a soul might become a "vegetable," it may choose to release rather than continue in physical form and endure increasing suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Karma Cannot Be Changed, Only Balanced or Released
Karma cannot be changed; it can only be balanced or released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.
*   **Balancing Karma:** This involves going through similar experiences or paying back what was taken, often with the same person involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.
*   **Releasing Karma:** This involves experiencing a similar emotion or energy exchange, but not necessarily with the same people or in the exact same situation. It's an exchange with the cosmic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>.

## Destiny and Free Will
[[interplay_between_free_will_fate_and_karma | Destiny]] is not predestined but a combination of karma and the choices made through [[interplay_between_free_will_fate_and_karma | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. Your choices and hard work contribute to your destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>. For example, if three people are given the same opportunity, their choices on how to use it will lead to different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>.

## Practical Approaches to Karmic Lessons
As a karma coach, one aims to not only provide microscopic predictions but also help clients understand why they attracted certain situations (whether karmic or self-created) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. The goal is to teach lessons that build mental and emotional immunity to better handle situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Self-Assessment and Awareness
To avoid toxic patterns, it's important to:
*   Listen to your intuition or "gut feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   Engage in self-assessment, such as writing down your adult life experiences, relationships, and early feelings versus how things ended. This helps identify common links and patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Self-Forgiveness and Boundaries
Sometimes, the lesson needed is self-forgiveness rather than forgiveness towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. If an individual keeps attracting broken or wounded souls, it might be a lesson in setting boundaries and attracting "whole and complete souls" in personal space, reserving healing for a professional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Giving to others should be balanced with their capacity to receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### The Power of Grounding and Gratitude
To receive manifestations and align with one's home frequency, grounding is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. If one sways or gets carried away by others' energies, they will not receive what is meant for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Grounding:** Comes from knowing and trusting your truth and having deep faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Grounding (Meditative):** Visualizing connecting the root chakra to the center of Mother Earth, releasing negative energy, and then pulling in rejuvenating energy from the Divine Source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This should be done after meditation to balance increased vibrational frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Gratitude is a powerful tool to increase one's frequency significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. True gratitude means acknowledging and making the most out of what the universe has given, utilizing it to fulfill manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. Acknowledging what is already present and given attracts more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

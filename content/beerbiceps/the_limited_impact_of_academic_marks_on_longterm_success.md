Before entering the real world, it's crucial to work on improving one's [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A key lesson for teenagers emphasizes that academic marks do not define a person's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Academic Marks vs. Real-World Success

Society often instills the belief that academic marks determine one's future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. However, the reality is that marks only influence the initial chapters, approximately the first 5 to 10 years, of a person's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Beyond this period, factors such as the college attended or specific scores in subjects like mathematics become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Instead, long-term success is dictated by:
*   Competence in one's chosen field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   The kind of human being one is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   The amount of effort and passion put into every task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>

## Understanding Pressure from Others

Parents and teachers may exert pressure regarding academic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This pressure is often motivated by their desire to protect their own reputations or to motivate students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. When they express disappointment, it is often their way of encouraging improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Therefore, scoring poorly on a test is merely a minor event on the timeline of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The true determinant of success is the [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | hustle]] and continuous effort applied throughout life to become the best version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

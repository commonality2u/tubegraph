Bollywood actress Tamannaah Bhatia shares her candid thoughts on the realities of fame, personal privacy, and maintaining a sense of self in the public eye. While she appreciates the humility that comes with her profession, she admits that the "fame part" is not something she particularly enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## The Liabilities of Fame

Tamannaah notes that while being in front of the camera is enjoyable, everything else that accompanies fame is a "liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A significant consequence is the severe lack of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Contrary to popular belief that acting makes one invincible, Tamannaah argues it actually makes an individual far more vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

She experiences "moral policing" at a "zillion fold" compared to normal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Every step she takes is influenced by the perspective of "what will people think," an external pressure she believes has "ruined enough lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Maintaining Authenticity

Despite the pressures, Tamannaah strives to remain connected to who she was before fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. She feels fortunate that fame and money came her way through her chosen work, and she consciously decided to stay true to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Those who know her closely describe her as a "non-film person" and are often surprised by her down-to-earth demeanor, noting she doesn't carry the "air" typically associated with film industry professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Her idea of happiness and comfort involves enjoying small things, such as eating chips with friends while wearing "Jala clothes" and no makeup, looking "unkempt" or "homeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Personal and Professional Challenges

### The Quest for Peace
Tamannaah actively searches for peace in her life, recognizing that she has "very little control" over external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. For years, she didn't have a concept of weekends, working whenever there was a day to work, and communicating in terms of dates rather than days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. She believes that wealth and fame can add to "craziness," making it harder to be peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The COVID-19 lockdown served as a "reality check," highlighting the frantic pace she used to live at and prompting her to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Relationships and Lifestyle
Her nomadic, suitcase-living lifestyle makes romantic relationships challenging, acknowledging that anyone dating her would face a "really hard time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. She believes that relationships should not require walking on eggshells and emphasizes the importance of a partner who adds value to one's life rather than creating stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. She advocates for partners who are "self-made," valuing the commonality and understanding of hard work that comes from such a journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

### Pressures on Appearance and Performance
As an actress, there's a constant expectation to be "presentable," which she finds "exhausting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. She highlights the harsh reality that even when sick or going through personal trauma, she is expected to "oblige" requests for selfies, as fans "don't really care" about her personal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. After her [[the_impact_of_covid19_on_tamannaah_bhatias_life_and_health | COVID-19]] recovery, while on heavy medication, she received insensitive comments about looking "fat" in pictures, questioning the public's lack of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

She states that male actors face even "worse" pressures, particularly due to the immense money riding on their films. A single flop can lead to severe criticism and impact their market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. Unlike content creators who have full control, actors only have limited control over the final product, as "24 crafts" are involved in a film's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

## Fame's "Toxic Aspect"

Tamannaah identifies jealousy as a "toxic aspect" of fame, sensing it around her, sometimes masked by overly sweet behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. She believes that people struggle with others' success, especially when opportunities line up for someone who works hard, while others put in minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. This "status game" mentality, she notes, is deeply ingrained in Indian culture, making it challenging for people to genuinely value what others have achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.

Overall, Tamannaah acknowledges that while fame brings opportunities, it also demands significant personal sacrifices and a constant negotiation with public perception and expectations.

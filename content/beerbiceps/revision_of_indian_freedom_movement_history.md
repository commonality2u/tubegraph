The narrative of the Indian Freedom Movement taught in traditional history textbooks has been subject to significant debate and calls for revision. Critics argue that a substantial portion of India's history has been [[historical_revisionism_and_untold_narratives_of_world_war_2 | hidden]] or presented in a biased, incomplete manner, leading to a distorted understanding of the struggle for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Criticisms of Current Historical Narratives

### Hidden and Fragmented History
The existing education system is accused of teaching "wrong history" or "irrelevant history," focusing on topics that may not be long-term significant, while omitting crucial events and narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Many young people express frustration at being "fed the wrong facts" and not being told the truth about India's past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The podcast itself aims to unveil [[historical_revisionism_and_untold_narratives_of_world_war_2 | hidden history]] related to the Indian Freedom Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Delhi-Centric Bias
A major critique is that Indian history, as taught, is "Delhi-centric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For instance, NCERT books dedicate three chapters to the Mughal dynasty and obscure Delhi dynasties like the Lodis, Khaljis, and Tughlaqs, whose contributions are considered minimal beyond architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Meanwhile, mighty empires and dynasties like the Cholas (who ruled for a thousand years), Vijayanagar Empire, Shahans, Rashtrakutas, Palas, Kadambas, Gangas, Chalukyas, Wodeyars, and Ahoms (who ruled for 600 years) are largely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The Northeast, in particular, is described as a "complete black hole" in historical education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Linear and Monochromatic View of the Freedom Struggle
The dominant narrative portrays the Indian Freedom Movement as a linear, simplistic, and monochromatic process, primarily highlighting the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This view, reinforced by films like *Gandhi*, is seen as incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

There was also a significant armed resistance, forming an "unending chain" from the [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | 1857 Uprising]] until the [[significance_of_forgotten_events_like_the_1946_naval_mutiny | 1946 Naval Mutiny]] in Bombay (now Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This alternative story of the freedom struggle is often not taught to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Mislabeling of Revolutionaries
Delhi University textbooks, for instance, have referred to [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | Bhagat Singh]], Bagha Jatin, and Chandrashekhar Azad as "revolutionary terrorists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Descendants of [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | Bhagat Singh]] have protested this term, stating it was coined by Colonial Masters and should not be used post-independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The 1857 Uprising was called a "sepoy mutiny" by the British, a disparaging term, while [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | V.D. Savarkar]] termed it the "first war of Indian independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Similarly, the [[significance_of_forgotten_events_like_the_1946_naval_mutiny | 1946 Naval Mutiny]] should ideally be called the "last war of Indian independence" rather than a "mutiny" against perceived rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Political Influence on Historical Narratives
After independence, the people in power influenced the historical narrative to highlight a specific viewpoint about the freedom struggle, suppressing figures and movements not aligned with the mainstream non-violent movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This is attributed to [[controversies_surrounding_gandhi_and_nehru | Jawaharlal Nehru's]] government, which allegedly suppressed opposing viewpoints despite being portrayed as a great democrat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. An example given is the historian R.C. Majumdar, who was initially commissioned to write the history of the freedom struggle but was removed for insisting on a critical view of Gandhi's failures and flip-flop policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. A bureaucrat with no background in modern Indian history was then appointed to write the official history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This incentivized historians to "tow the line" to secure their jobs and patronage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

The branding of figures like [[controversies_surrounding_gandhi_and_nehru | Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[controversies_surrounding_gandhi_and_nehru | Jawaharlal Nehru]] in the global narrative is also seen as influenced by Western geopolitical powers, perpetuating a simplified image of India's independence as a purely peaceful transfer of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Suppression of Truth and Consequences
The deliberate suppression of historical facts has led to a lack of understanding of significant events and figures. For example, the [[significance_of_forgotten_events_like_the_1946_naval_mutiny | 1946 Naval Mutiny]] is rarely highlighted in textbooks, even though British Prime Minister Clement Attlee indicated it, along with the Indian National Army's heroics, was a primary reason for Britain's hasty departure from India, not the non-violent Quit India Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Collaborators with the British Raj allegedly gained power post-independence and ensured that much of the truth was suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. An example given is Yashpal, who was reportedly a British mole and betrayed revolutionaries, yet became a celebrated intellectual and author after independence, receiving awards and writing books that glorified himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

The demonization of certain figures, such as [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | V.D. Savarkar]], is also highlighted. Despite his significant contributions and suffering, he was portrayed negatively, even to the extent of a celebrated artist like Pt. Hrishikesh Mangeshkar losing his job for setting Savarkar's poetry to music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. The false implication of Savarkar in Gandhi's murder case, despite judicial exoneration, continues to be a point of political contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

The anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin carnage in 1948, following Gandhi's murder, is cited as a forgotten atrocity where Congress goons retaliated against an entire community, leading to killings and ethnic cleansing without justice or police action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.

### The Need for "Truth and Reconciliation"
It is argued that an unhealed past, where historical wounds are covered up and crimes whitewashed, continues to affect future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. There is a call for "Truth and Reconciliation" with India's history, not for revenge or retribution, but to make peace with the past and learn from mistakes to build a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

The current generation is seen as the first truly independent Indian generation, and there is a need to re-educate them about the full truth of their history to value the freedom gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. The "divide and rule" strategy, used for a thousand years, continues to plague [[indias_political_landscape | India's political landscape]] with internal conflicts (e.g., left-wing vs. right-wing), hindering the nation's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

It is important to remember that skin color is genetic and should not be changed; instead, focus on making your skin the best version of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The historical emphasis on fair skin over dark skin originated during the imperialistic age when European countries influenced other parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Today, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Skin Whitening

Do not pursue skin whitening or use skin whitening creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These products are harmful in the long term, containing substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids that can spoil skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Achieving a Healthy Glow

### For Dry Skin
If you have dry skin, a mild moisturizer is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. After washing your face and drying it with a towel, apply a moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For very dry lips, apply moisturizer or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This routine helps achieve glowing, healthy skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### For Oily Skin
For oily skin, a home remedy using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth) can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This product is available at Indian grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

**Recipe for Oily Skin Mask:**
1.  Buy a block of Fuller's Earth and pound a bit of it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric into the powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
3.  Squeeze a little lemon juice into the mixture to create a paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
4.  Add a few drops of water if needed to achieve a smooth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
5.  Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
6.  Do not keep it on for longer than 20 minutes, then wash it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Turmeric cleanses the face as an antiseptic, lemon helps increase glow, and Fuller's Earth absorbs excess oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use this mixture more than once or twice a week (e.g., with a 3-day gap), as overuse can cause the skin to secrete even more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. You should see a change in your face within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### The Importance of Exfoliation

Exfoliation can help achieve glowing, "baby-type" skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Use a face scrub, which is a face wash with small, hard particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

**How to Exfoliate:**
*   Massage the face in a circular motion, firmly but without pressing too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Press hard enough to feel a slight tingling sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The hard particles increase blood circulation to the face, promoting skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use this method if you are very acne-prone or have active acne, as it can harm inflammations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For those without acne who want healthy, glowing skin, exfoliation is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Limit exfoliation to once a week, possibly on the same day you use a Multani Mitti mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

For clear, glowing skin, focus on your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Hydration**: Stay hydrated throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Aim for clear urine; if it's slightly yellow, drink more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake**: Prioritize vegetables, which are nutritionally dense, providing more vitamins and minerals than fruits for the same food amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Incorporate a variety of colorful vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## General Grooming Tips for a Refined Look

Looking neat is crucial for a more handsome appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Beards**: If you keep a beard, ensure it is well-maintained with grooming products or regular trimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It should not look like a "big bush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Patchy Beards**: If you have a patchy beard that grows unevenly, it's generally better to avoid a beard and go clean-shaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. A patchy beard can make you look scruffy and unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Your physique is more important than your skin color for pulling off clothing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Working on your physique accounts for almost 90% of your overall appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. You don't need to be a bodybuilder, just look healthy with filled-out arms, chest, legs, and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This can be achieved through basic gym workouts or home workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Clothing Colors
*   **With a Good Physique**: If you have a good physique, you can wear absolutely any color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Without an Ideal Physique**: If you are very skinny or slightly heavier, be mindful of bright colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Bright colors like white, red, orange, and bright blue highlight your physique, and the contrast with darker skin can draw even more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In these cases, it's best to avoid brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Recommended Colors for Darker Skin Tones**: Prioritize darker colors for t-shirts and shirts, such as black, navy blue, brown, olive green, dark gray, and dark maroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. These colors complement a slightly dark or wheatish Indian skin tone very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## The Most Important Factor: Self-Love and Confidence

While grooming and fashion tips are helpful, they are not as important as cultivating positivity and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. People are attracted to self-assurance and how comfortable you are in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Embrace your natural skin color and do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Reject the idea that dark skin doesn't look good or that you should get rid of a suntan, as this promotes racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Weight loss depends primarily on diet, accounting for 70-80% of the overall journey, while exercise contributes about 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Successful weight loss is not about following a fixed meal plan, but rather about understanding food science and making informed food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The fundamental principle for weight loss is creating a caloric deficit, where calories consumed are less than calories expended, consistently until the target weight is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Weight Loss Speed Scale

The speed of weight loss can be viewed on a scale, with easier, slower methods on one end and more challenging, rapid methods on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The choice of strategy depends on an individual's mental state and willingness to make sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Higher levels of the scale incorporate the rules from all preceding levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Level 1: Cutting Desserts

The initial step in a weight loss journey involves minimizing or eliminating desserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Desserts are problematic due to:
*   **Sugar:** An addictive substance that triggers a similar brain reaction to cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Dirty Carbohydrates:** Ingredients like maida (refined flour) are not beneficial for the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **High Fat Content:** Fat is often added for flavor, making desserts highly palatable and addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Level 2: Eliminating Vegetarian Junk Food

Beyond desserts, the next step is to cut out vegetarian junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Unlike non-vegetarian options which might offer some protein, vegetarian junk food (e.g., chira, farsan, pav bhaji, pani puri) is primarily composed of refined/simple carbohydrates and unhealthy fats, with little protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. As an alternative, paneer-based dishes are recommended for vegetarians, as they provide protein and are a better choice than other vegetarian junk foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Level 3: Making Better Carbohydrate Choices

This level involves replacing simple/high GI (Glycemic Index) carbohydrates with complex/low GI carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Complex carbohydrates are harder for the body to digest, leading to prolonged satiety and fewer calories consumed overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Replace:** White bread, maida, white rice, and potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **With:** Brown rice, oats, whole wheat, and sweet potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
Following rules up to Level 3 can help maintain a healthy weight indefinitely, especially when managing cheat meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Level 4: Indian Paleo Diet

This level introduces specific diet protocols, moving beyond just elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Indian Paleo is a low-carb diet that avoids all standard carbohydrate sources like rice, potatoes, wheat, and other grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, it includes meat, vegetables, fruits, and unlike American Paleo, it incorporates legumes like dals, despite their carbohydrate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The typical plan involves fruit for breakfast, followed by veggies and other non-carb foods for the rest of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Level 5: The Ketogenic Diet

The [[types_of_ketogenic_diets_for_different_goals|ketogenic diet]] is an effective strategy for rapid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It is a very low-carb diet where net carbohydrates are restricted to less than 20 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. In strict keto, carbohydrates primarily come from green leafy vegetables, excluding higher-carb vegetables like carrots and beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Adopting a [[types_of_ketogenic_diets_for_different_goals|ketogenic diet]] can lead to very rapid weight loss, with visible transformations possible in just a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Level 6: Intermittent Fasting (IF)

[[intermittent_fasting_overview_and_benefits|Intermittent fasting]] is another protocol for accelerated weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For those who prefer not to follow a low-carb approach, IF offers a different structured eating pattern. Detailed guidelines and plans for [[nutritional_guidelines_for_intermittent_fasting|intermittent fasting]] are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Level 7: Combining Intermittent Fasting and Ketogenic Diet

For extremely rapid weight loss, such as losing 5 kg in a week, combining [[intermittent_fasting_overview_and_benefits|intermittent fasting]] with a [[types_of_ketogenic_diets_for_different_goals|ketogenic diet]] is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Both protocols individually speed up weight loss, and their combination is considered safe and highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, this is a very difficult protocol to adhere to, requiring strict adherence to both IF and keto rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Level 8: Saltless for Water Weight Loss (Unhealthy)

This extreme level is **not recommended for general health** and is only suitable for temporary aesthetic purposes, like photo shoots or specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It involves going saltless for 1-2 days, often combined with diuretic pills and potassium supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This process aims to eliminate water weight, leading to a "paper-thin skin" appearance by inducing partial dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It is a dangerous and unhealthy protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

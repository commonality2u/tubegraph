Palki Sharma, managing editor at Firstpost, is recognized for her directness and significant contributions to [[geopolitics_and_foreign_policy | geopolitics]] in India, acting as a prominent voice for the country's narrative on a global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. She emphasizes that her team focuses on stories and fresh perspectives rather than algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Borders and Conflicts
Borders provide structure to the world, essential for administration from countries down to villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Wars often arise from the political ambitions of those in power or when one side feels wronged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Respect for established borders is crucial to prevent conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### The Pursuit of Power and Happiness
What drives the world forward is often the pursuit of power and happiness, which can manifest as a desire for money, land, or more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. While ambition and desire can lead to negative actions, most people are law-abiding, which helps maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

### Current Geopolitical Landscape
The world is currently in a multi-polar phase, where more countries are asserting their independence and not necessarily adhering to the demands of larger powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. There are two major wars and over 30 other ongoing conflicts that receive less global attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

### Power Diffusion in the Information Age
In the information age, power is diffusing beyond nation-states to non-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. This includes terrorist groups, NGOs, civil society movements, and tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. Governments often focus on military spending but may neglect these other forces that shape global perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

### Soft Power vs. Hard Power
*   **Soft power** is about attraction and influence, not coercion (e.g., Hollywood, Bollywood, K-pop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.
*   **Hard power** relies on military might, economy, and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>.
*   **Smart power** is a combination of both soft and hard power, which countries should aim for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

The U.S. has been effective in wielding soft power by promoting its value system and society as an ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. China's soft power efforts, despite significant spending on initiatives like Confucius Institutes, have not been successful due to a lack of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. India has promoted yoga and Ayurveda as soft power elements but lags behind in overall global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.

### The Role of Media and Perception
Media plays a crucial role in shaping narratives and human viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a>. A strong global media presence is essential for a country to defend its intentions and expand its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>. The perception of a country, influenced by media, can impact investor decisions and overall global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>. For example, American media has successfully framed U.S. military interventions as "global wars on terrorism" for the "global good," unlike other nations' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

India currently lacks a significant global media presence compared to nations like the U.S., UK, France, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. There is a need for a credible and impactful global media presence to counter negative perceptions and showcase the country's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:11">[02:21:11]</a>.

## Global Conflicts and Regional Dynamics

### [[Current geopolitical scenarios in Israel and China | Israel-Palestine Conflict]]
The conflict in Israel began with an attack from Hamas, causing widespread disbelief due to the scale of the violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Initial sentiment saw Israel as the victim of an unprovoked and heinous attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:25">[05:55:25]</a>. However, the prolonged urban warfare, causing over 30,000 civilian deaths in Gaza, has led to growing anger and pushback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Many Israeli citizens want Prime Minister Netanyahu to step down and for the hostages in Gaza to be brought back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:01">[05:56:01]</a>. The international community, including the U.S., has been criticized for its inconsistent approach, providing aid while simultaneously supplying weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. A solution requires conversation, similar to the Yom Kippur War, but the insincerity of one side can create an impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:01">[05:56:01]</a>. War also creates its own economy, with illicit activities and profiteering taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

### [[Geopolitical Relations of India with Pakistan and China | India-China Relations]]
[[Chinas Geopolitical Challenges | China's]] refusal to accept and respect borders, along with a lack of sincerity in talks, has led to clashes with India, such as the Galwan clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The Communist Party of China's historical fear of imploding like Soviet Russia led to tight internal controls and massive spending on internal security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. Xi Jinping's aggressive foreign policy and crackdowns on corruption have coincided with internal challenges like a debt bubble and a struggling property market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. Despite a large military, it remains untested, and while China has invested in initiatives like the Belt and Road, these have often led to debt traps and a lack of trust from other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

### Brexit and Europe's Future
Brexit has not benefited Britain, leading to economic struggles and political chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. The UK is actively seeking trade partnerships, including a Free Trade Agreement with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Europe faces significant challenges related to immigration, with rising concerns about the economic burden on taxpayers and cultural integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. While Europe has benefited historically from global resources, it must now accommodate diverse populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. Issues like aging societies and a need for external workers further complicate Europe's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

### Iran's Geopolitical Role
Iran has always been a significant geopolitical player due to its oil wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. Post-1979 Revolution, it became an Islamic state under the clergy, which dismantled many previous freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. The JCPOA (nuclear deal) with the U.S. and other powers aimed to limit Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief, but the U.S. unilaterally withdrew under Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. Iran maintains proxies across the region, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Houthis in Yemen, leading to regional tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. Internal protests, like the anti-hijab movement, have also challenged the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. The recent missile strike with Israel was seen as a "performative strike," intended to show strength without causing significant damage or reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>.

## American Politics and Global Impact
The upcoming U.S. presidential election presents a choice between two old, white men, highlighting a lack of diversity and youth representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>. The U.S. faces significant domestic challenges, including immigration, abortion rights, and rampant gun violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>. Despite these issues, the U.S. maintains a lead in key areas like [[Technologys impact on geopolitics | technology]], particularly in chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

## The Human Element of Conflict
War zones reveal immense human grit and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:57">[05:51:57]</a>. People living in conflict areas often take life for granted, having to prepare for nights in shelters and coping with constant threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:50">[05:17:50]</a>. Despite the chaos, individuals try to maintain customs and find strength day-to-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

### The Economy of War
War is not solely about weapons manufacturers; it spawns its own economy. For example, during the Gaza conflict, companies and groups facilitated the exit of Gazans for a fee and took a share of aid going into the Strip, selling it on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>. Some individuals may benefit financially or politically from conflicts remaining active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.

### Evolving Warfare
Modern warfare is evolving rapidly, with the increasing use of cost-effective technologies like drones, challenging the traditional dominance of expensive military hardware like tanks and ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. "Smaller dogs" can now inflict significant damage, making it a less level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The world is in a phase of significant [[Global geopolitical tensions and economic impacts | global geopolitical tensions and economic impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. While predicting specific scenarios is difficult, history suggests that solutions to conflicts are ultimately found through dialogue and negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:50">[05:57:50]</a>. The current landscape is complex, with no "one-size-fits-all" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:41">[05:58:41]</a>.

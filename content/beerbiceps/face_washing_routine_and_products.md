This article provides a [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] applicable to various [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | skin types]], including [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | oily skin]], [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | dry skin]], and [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | regular skin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Following this routine can help prevent [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]], [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | blemishes]], skin bumps, and irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Face Washing Frequency

It is recommended to wash your face a minimum of twice a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
*   Once before going to bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Once in the morning, either after waking up or upon reaching your office or college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

If you engage in activities that cause significant sweating, such as cardio, football, or cricket, you can wash your face a third time after returning home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, ideally, stick to twice a day and only go for three washes on occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Choosing a Face Wash

While mild face washes have been previously recommended, the current emphasis is on using 100% herbal face washes, especially given their increased availability in the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Be cautious of large companies claiming their products are Ayurvedic, as they might only contain Ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Recommended Brands**:
    *   **Budget-Friendly**: Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, also known for its rose water products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Premium**: Kama Ayurveda and Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
These brands are recommended for their 100% natural, Ayurvedic, herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Some specific products mentioned include a rose water face wash and an Ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream/gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Face Washing Technique

The face washing routine applies to all types of face washes, whether herbal, normal, or chemical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
1.  **Timing**: It's often preferred to wash your face after you've [[facial_hair_grooming_and_shaving_tips | shaved]] or after a shower, as skin pores are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to clean and close them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Herbal face washes also provide nutrition to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Product Amount**: Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or a slight amount of gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  **Application**:
    *   Rub the product between your hands before applying it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   **Cheeks**: Apply in a circular motion for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck**: Continue applying in a circular motion to these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **T-area (Forehead, Nose, Chin)**: Apply in a circular motion across this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   **Benefits of Circular Motion**: Increases blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes skin growth, and cleans dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Technique**: Be gentle but firm with your strokes; avoid pressing too hard or too light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
4.  **Allow to Sit**: If using a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to work its magic before rinsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Water Temperature for Rinsing
Do not wash your face with hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The ideal temperature is room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature, but not hot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Natural Moisturizers

After washing, applying natural [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | moisturizers]] is crucial, regardless of [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | skin type]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Natural [[use_of_skincare_products_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | moisturizers]] are preferred over chemically made ones, which can clog pores, worsen [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]], and harm beneficial skin bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Application Tips
*   Always use clean cotton balls for application to avoid transferring bacteria from hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Recommended Natural Moisturizers
1.  **Rose Water**: Acts as a disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Apply twice a day: once before going out and once before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **Lime Juice**:
    *   **Frequency**: Apply only once or twice a week as it's stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Helps fight [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]] and fade [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | blemishes]] or [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]] marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Note**: It may cause a stinging sensation, indicating it's working. If too strong, mix with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  **Aloe Vera**: A powerful moisturizer with medicinal properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Application**: Scrape pulp from an aloe vera plant. It can be mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Effective for extremely [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | dry skin]] or very bad [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]] when used once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. May also cause a slight sting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products (Short-Term)

While the natural [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | moisturizers]] mentioned serve as long-term [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | anti-acne products]], specific short-term solutions are available for active, painful pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Recommended Short-Term Anti-Acne Solutions
1.  **Natural Herbal Oils**: These are low-density skin oils designed for pimples, unlike dense oils like coconut oil that can clog pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Sweet almond oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, rose hip oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, or tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: They are absorbed by the pimple, reducing inflammation and redness, and helping the pimple heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Always try these oils first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
2.  **Antibiotics (e.g., Clinda)**: Can be used if natural oils don't work, but use sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Overuse can destroy beneficial bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Diet and Lifestyle Factors

Diet and lifestyle significantly impact skin quality and [[antiacne_products_and_remedies | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Dietary Adjustments**:
    *   Quit sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Reduce junk food and packaged fried snacks (which often contain dirty oils and trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   Include more vegetables and fruits in your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   Avoid overconsumption of any single food type, including non-vegetarian items, eggs, or particular vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Stress Reduction**: High stress elevates cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin, aging, skin quality, and can increase oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   **Methods**: Improve [[sleep hygiene]] (quality of sleep) and meditate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Both can reduce stress levels and improve skin quality overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

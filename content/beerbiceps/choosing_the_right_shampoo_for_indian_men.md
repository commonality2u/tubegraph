A [[importance_of_mens_hair_care_routine | hair care routine]] is crucial for men's grooming, especially as hair thinning can occur later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While genetics play a role, understanding how to care for your hair and scalp is essential for [[importance_of_mens_hair_care_routine | hair health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Addressing Oily Scalps and Dandruff

Indian men, due to their genetics and the hot climate, often experience oily scalps and are prone to [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Anti-Dandruff Shampoos

For many, an anti-dandruff shampoo should be a priority when washing hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
Popular brands include Head and Shoulders, Clinic All Clear, or Seba Med <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. These are strong shampoos, and it's important to use them only once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Overusing anti-dandruff shampoos can negatively impact your hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Mild Shampoos for Hair Quality

To maintain hair quality, it's recommended to use milder shampoos, similar to those often used by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. An example mentioned is L'Oreal's smooth intense smoothening shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Shampoo for Your Hair Type

When selecting a mild shampoo, look for variables that address your specific hair concerns. Shampoos are formulated for issues like silky hair, unmanageable hair, or frizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For instance, if you have frizzy hair, a shampoo designed for "unmanageable dry hair" can help make it look smoother and denser after washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Shampoo Usage Protocol

*   **Mild Shampoo:** Use a mild shampoo two to three times a week, roughly every alternate day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Anti-Dandruff Shampoo:** On days when you're not going out, such as Sundays or Mondays, use a strong anti-dandruff shampoo once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Adjust for Hair Type:**
    *   If you have oily hair (common for Indians), follow this protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   If you have drier hair, you may need to use different products and potentially use [[conditioner_use_and_pairing_with_shampoo | conditioners]] more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Regardless of hair type, keep the use of anti-dandruff shampoos to a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Shampoos are water-based products primarily used to wash the scalp and remove excess dirt and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Complementary Advice: Pillowcases

If you struggle with persistent [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | dandruff]], ensure your [[role_of_environment_in_managing_dandruff | pillowcases]] and bed sheets are cleaned regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Dandruff is an infection, and continuous contact with soiled pillowcases can reinfect your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

When selecting shirts with patterns, there are several ground rules to follow to ensure an elegant and classy look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:56">[01:48:56]</a>.

## Key Rules for Pattern Shirts

*   **Color Limit**
    *   A patterned shirt should ideally have a maximum of two colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:14">[01:54:14]</a>.
    *   This typically means one primary color for the shirt itself and a secondary color for the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.

*   **Pattern Coverage**
    *   Ensure the pattern covers the entire body of the shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>.
    *   Shirts with singular prints like a dragon or a number on them are considered tacky, not true pattern shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

*   **Pattern Simplicity and Color Choice**
    *   Prioritize simpler patterns such as dots or pinstripes, as they tend to look very elegant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>.
    *   If you opt for a louder pattern, a monochrome design is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:02">[02:24:02]</a>.
        *   For example, a black and white pattern is generally preferred over a pink and white one, as brighter color combinations can appear very loud and may not suit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:908">[02:28:908]</a>.
        *   Black and white is often the go-to choice for patterned shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

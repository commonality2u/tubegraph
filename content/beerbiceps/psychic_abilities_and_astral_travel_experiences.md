## Understanding Psychic Abilities

The term "psychic" originates from the Greek word "Psy," meaning soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Unlike psychology, which studies chemical imbalances in the body, or psychologists, who study the emotional body, a psychic focuses on the soul body or soul energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Psychics interact with the soul's journey, including past lives, current life lessons, and overall purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### The Third Eye

The activation of the third eye is described as incredibly powerful, enabling one to "see beyond what you can see physically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Biologically and scientifically, the third eye is considered the "seat for all our senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. It is located near the pituitary and pineal glands, connecting the nerves from the eyes and ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

When activated, the third eye grants the ability to perceive information in two primary forms:
*   **Clairaudience:** The gift of hearing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.
*   **Clairvoyance:** The gift of seeing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

### Intuition as the Soul's Voice

Intuition is defined as the voice of the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. Before birth, every soul creates a "master plan" or "blueprint" for its life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. As humans are born, societal pressures, religious backgrounds, parental upbringing, traumas, and educational pressures can distract the brain from the soul's original purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The soul, however, constantly nudges and guides, reminding the individual of their true path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

## Personal Psychic Experiences

The speaker's own [[spiritual_and_yogic_lifestyle_and_its_impact_on_intuition | spiritual journey]] began early, with her third eye opening at age nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. At thirteen and a half, she became a Reiki master, making her the youngest in India at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This initiation into her powers at age 16 led to significant [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | tantric psychic attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

### Astral Travel and Psychic Attacks

When the third eye opens, it connects one to realities beyond physical sight, including realms of darkness, light, spirits, ghosts, and entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Astral travel occurs when the soul leaves the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. The speaker experienced intense psychic attacks, including attempts to capture her soul and strangulation sensations as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.

Protection methods learned from her master included energy scanners, invoking divine light, and cutting cords to ensure the body's physical safety during astral experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.

### Walk-ins and Entities

*   **Walk-ins** are positive entities that temporarily replace the soul in the body during astral travel, leaving when the soul returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.
*   **Entities** can stay in the body even after the soul returns, draining energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>.

The speaker has experienced channeling powerful information by downloading it from higher beings like Mahadev Shiva and Quan Buddha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Encounters with Lower Beings and Ghosts

In 33 years, the speaker has encountered three "scary" entities that resemble traditional horror movie ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>. One encounter occurred in her London home, where she saw a female entity with blue-gray eyes and open hair, resembling Samara from *The Ring*, sitting on a closed pot in her bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>. The entity vanished when it realized it was seen, indicating it was a passerby not intending harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that spirits and entities are always present, but they generally do not harm unless provoked, similar to how one should not bother wild animals on a safari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>.

The most potent [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | lower beings]] encountered were tantrics not in human form, who attempted to capture her soul to gain more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:44">[01:49:44]</a>. These entities were once humans who became attached to their dark tantric practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>. To counter them, the speaker uses energy protection, visualizing a protective bubble to reduce their power without harming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>.

### Near-Death Experience

The speaker recounted a near-death experience from a car accident where she sustained a whiplash injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:29">[01:42:29]</a>. While unconscious, she saw herself moving through a peaceful "blue passage with white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a>. She awoke after repeatedly stating, "I don't want to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>. After returning, her suffering increased, which aligns with the concept that skipping an "exit point" in life leads to more challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>. She believes she returned because she has "a lot more to do" in terms of healing the world and experiencing motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>.

### [[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | Spirit Guides]] and Ancestors

Spirit guides are family members who have passed away and choose to stay around to guide and protect living family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. They can be present with multiple family members simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. Spirit guides communicate through dreams or by influencing other people to deliver messages if the individual is too distracted to receive them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. Sometimes, their presence is due to unfinished karma or unfulfilled desires from their past life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. The speaker has experienced her grandfather's soul showering her with "spiritual will" and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>, noting his strong connection to her birth and his devotion to Durga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

### [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | Addressing Skepticism]]

The speaker welcomes skeptics and invites them to experience a reading, as personal experience is key to belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. She notes that the Western world has less exposure to metaphysical experiences compared to the Eastern world, contributing to skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Her education, which includes a PhD in metaphysical and humanitarian science and NLP, helps her bridge the gap between religion, spirituality, and science, enabling her to communicate about these topics using a "Global language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. She also conducts aura scanning experiments to demonstrate changes in her vibrational frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

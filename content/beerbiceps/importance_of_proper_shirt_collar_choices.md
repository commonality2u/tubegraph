When it comes to wearing shirts, avoiding common mistakes, especially regarding collar choices, is crucial for a polished look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Avoiding "Flappy Collars"

A key rule for gentlemen is to avoid "flappy" collars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. To maintain a sharp appearance, shirts should have collars that stand firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Ensuring Collar Stability

To prevent a messy or "chappie" look, ensure your shirt collars are always neat and upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This can be achieved through several methods:
*   **Button-down shirts**: Choose shirts with buttons that secure the collar points to the shirt body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Stiff collars**: Opt for shirts that inherently have a stiff collar construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Collar stays**: Utilize collar stays inserted under the collar to keep them standing erect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

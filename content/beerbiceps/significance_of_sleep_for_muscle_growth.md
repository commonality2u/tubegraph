Getting [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | enough sleep]] is crucial for muscle recovery and growth, and it is a key method to reduce muscle soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## The Role of Hormones in Muscle Repair

For muscles to repair themselves, the body utilizes several hormones, with the [[role_of_human_growth_hormone_in_intermittent_fasting | human growth hormone]] (HGH) being the most significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. HGH is primarily released during the early hours of [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. While bodybuilders may take HGH injections to facilitate growth, the natural release of substantial amounts of HGH occurs through [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Sleep as a "Supplement"

It is emphasized that [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] is more effective for muscle growth and recovery than many commercial supplements like BCAAs or glutamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. If [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] could be packaged as a supplement, it would be unmatched in its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Therefore, for individuals aiming to build muscle mass and increase strength, ensuring [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | enough sleep]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Recommended Sleep Duration

A recommended duration for [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] is generally around 7 to 8.5 hours, and potentially up to 9 hours for some, depending on individual body responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Prioritizing [[the_importance_of_sleep_and_its_effects_on_the_brain | sleep]] significantly contributes to overall recovery, which in turn leads to improved muscle gains and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

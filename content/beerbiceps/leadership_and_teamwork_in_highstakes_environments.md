Major V.I. Jacob, a veteran of the Indian Paras SF, is considered a legendary modern-day figure in the Indian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Indian Paras SF is regarded as the most advanced part of the Indian Army and one of the most respected regiments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article explores the unique aspects of [[Learning leadership and captaincy in cricket | leadership]] and [[role_of_teamwork_and_community_in_personal_growth | teamwork]] within this high-stakes environment, drawing from Major Jacob's experiences.

## The Ethos of Special Forces

The Indian Special Forces are introduced as the "badass part of the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, dealing with diverse terrains and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Major Jacob emphasizes that Special Forces is "a state of mind" and a "state of consciousness level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. It's about being "exploratory in nature" and willing to commit everything, even one's life, to explore more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | exploratory spirit]] is shared by Special Forces personnel worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The core mindset involves not being satisfied with what is known and seeking to explore more, even when it means constantly placing one's life on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Special Forces operations are characterized by efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. They are a "surgical instrument" used when a task needs to be done in a specific, highly efficient manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Selection and Training: Forging the Elite

The selection process for Special Forces is designed to be intensely challenging, shattering an individual's ego and preconceived perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It's a "time-tested set of circumstances which are created to break you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a> to reveal one's true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The ultimate goal is to determine if a person can be trusted in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Voluntary Choice
> Volunteering for Special Forces is the first level of clearance, as it requires immense courage to sign up for more intense challenges after already enduring years of rigorous academy training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. There is no certainty of selection, adding to the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

Once accepted into a Special Forces unit, life shifts immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Everything, "right from your ego to your clothes," is stripped away, forcing individuals into the present moment, which is often "crushing in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

The training itself is a dual process of being "broken down, shattered, torn apart" while simultaneously being taught crucial skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This includes:
*   Explosive training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>
*   Unarmed combat training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   Weapon training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>
*   Endurance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   Navigation training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>
*   Emergency medical first response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   Survival training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>

Trainees often experience severe sleep deprivation for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Officers, like Major Jacob, face additional mental pressures, such as memorizing vast amounts of information and being quizzed on it at inconvenient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Failure to perform or meet expectations, even after a sleepless night, can lead to immediate dismissal from the selection process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Result of Training
> This grueling process aims to foster a realization that "nothing is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. This self-realization becomes the "chief weapon of a special forces operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Training prepares individuals for the worst-case scenario, but no training can truly match the reality of combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Leadership and Brotherhood in Combat

Combat is a continuous training process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>; it tears individuals up even further, placing them in the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. It's a constant duality of "Life Death Life Death" at its cutting edge, leading to continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. This intense environment hones intuition, allowing operators to sense impending events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

In the chaos of combat, where bullets fly and bombs explode, instinct takes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Years of training and physical conditioning ensure that the body reacts automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. For Major Jacob, his weapon became an extension of his body through six months of constant proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, enabling instinctive, efficient action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

### The Essence of Leadership
Leadership in Special Forces is about taking responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. In combat, there is no hierarchy of rank; only immediate action and the ability to lead in the moment matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Major V.I. Jacob on Leadership
> "The man who stands now and returns fire, he's the leader. The man who stands now in that bloody hail of bloody machine gun fire who stands now and bloody gives it back because that's the only way you can stop that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

This kind of [[learning_leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | leadership]] is not earned through rank but through inherent capability and the trust of one's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.

### The Power of Love and Trust
A critical component in high-stakes combat situations is "love" between team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This love forms after trust is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>, and it enables an unparalleled level of efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. Major Jacob recounts an incident where his teammate's leg was severely injured in a difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. Despite the severity of the injury and the enemy presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, the team, driven by mutual trust and love, acted with incredible clarity and precision to administer first aid and extract their comrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. The injured soldier, despite his severe condition, refused to be a burden and insisted on walking, highlighting the profound resilience and [[role_of_teamwork_and_community_in_personal_growth | camaraderie]] within the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Overcoming Dread
> Major Jacob experienced an intense feeling of dread on the fifth day of a long mission, a feeling he had never encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Despite the overwhelming desire to retreat, he chose to stay put, trusting his training and the inherent drive of a Special Forces operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. Minutes later, his team sustained a critical injury, confirming his intuition but also validating his decision to face the challenge, demonstrating incredible [[handling_stress_and_overcoming_failure | mental fortitude]] under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

In moments of extreme chaos, the ability to remain centered and efficient is crucial for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. The [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | confidence]] born from extensive training and real-world experience, coupled with an unwavering belief in oneself and one's team, allows for remarkable clarity amidst confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

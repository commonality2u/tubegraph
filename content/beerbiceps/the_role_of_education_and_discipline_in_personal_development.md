The Chanchlani family's experiences highlight how [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | family and upbringing in shaping character]], along with dedication and a disciplined approach to both education and work, contribute significantly to personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Values and Upbringing
The Chanchlani children, Ashish and Muskan, are noted for their humility and down-to-earth nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Their parents instilled in them the value of treating everyone equally, from staff members to industry peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. True success, in their view, is not measured by numbers but by maintaining humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This core value of never showing off wealth was cultivated from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Work Ethic and Early Experiences
From a young age, Ashish was exposed to the world of work, starting at 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Unlike many "sheltered rich kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, he regularly engaged in practical tasks like going to the bank to deposit cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. This hands-on experience and early exposure to responsibility helped shape a significant part of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This early involvement in business, even before earning a significant income, contributed to his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

Ashish's passion for movies led him to bring advanced technology like 3D and Dolby 7.1 sound to their multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, demonstrating the impact of a strong personal interest on business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Balancing Passion and Education
When Ashish expressed a desire to pursue acting instead of engineering, his father encouraged him to finish his studies rather than leaving midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This highlights a balanced approach: supporting passion while emphasizing the [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | importance of education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Many children, it is observed, overreact when parents insist on a degree, but education is seen as a crucial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Humility and the Pursuit of Success
The family believes that the "hunger for success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> is what truly keeps one humble, rather than merely the pursuit of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Observing the transient nature of fame in the film industry, where public sentiment can shift rapidly based on a film's success, reinforced the idea that success is paramount over fleeting popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Ashish learned that even big stars are valued only as long as their work is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. This understanding nurtured a desire to build his own identity rather than relying on inherited wealth or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>, contributing to his [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | personal ambition in achieving success]].

## Parental Guidance and Support
Ashish's mother initially reacted to his video-making with confusion, but upon seeing his work, she became supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. She provided everything he needed at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> and offered feedback, even advising him against making too many videos to avoid boring the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Both parents supported his passion, understanding that obsession is crucial for those starting their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## The Importance of [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success|Discipline]]
A key piece of advice given to Ashish and Muskan by their parents is to "try to live a [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | disciplined life]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a> as it helps in all aspects of life. They also emphasize maintaining good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

## Fostering Independence and Individuality
The Chanchlani children learned from their father the importance of building their own identity, rather than relying on inherited wealth or status from a prominent family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. The father's own journey of overcoming pressure to live up to a "legendary" grandfather by becoming a legend in his own right served as a powerful example of self-made success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

Mothers are advised to allow their children the freedom to pursue their interests, giving them at least a year to explore their chosen path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. The analogy of a bird growing up and wanting to fly is used to encourage parents not to restrict their children too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. Overly restrictive parenting can lead to confusion in life, with many in the younger generation struggling to decide their next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

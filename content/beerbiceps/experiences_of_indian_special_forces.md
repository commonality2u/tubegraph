Indian Special Forces (SF) are described as the highest efficiency troop within the [[indian_armys_exposure_and_global_perception | Indian Armed Forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Their training and the types of missions they engage in make them psychologically and physically a cut above the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Major Vivek Jacobs, considered one of India's most fierce and battle-hardened soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, explains that being in the Special Forces is primarily about developing a particular mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This mindset is a directed form of energy used by the government and armed forces to address national security issues, ensuring the country remains a safe place for its citizens to live freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

> [!info] Nature of Special Forces Operations
> Special Forces units, including the [[major_vivek_jacobs_experiences_with_indian_paras_sf | Para SF]], are designed for "creative destruction," having an open-ended mandate to do anything, anywhere, anytime, depending on the requirements of a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Every operation is unique, like a masterpiece, requiring soldiers to be fully present and adaptable to new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. Many aspects of their work are secret and cannot be publicly disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Survival Instincts

Major Jacobs recounts a significant challenge during his decade-plus career where he experienced extreme discomfort and anxiety for the first time during an operation, feeling an instinctive urge to extract himself without a logical reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. He attributed this feeling to a desire for comfort, but shortly after, a teammate stepped on a mine and lost his leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. This immediately plunged them into chaos in a remote, dark, and mined area far from base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. In such critical moments, the SF training to prepare for "f***-ups" (situations where a team member is shot, maimed, or killed) becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.

> [!quote] "When everything is chaos... the difference between success and failure or life and death is basically what you're going to do now and how you going to handle it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>

In such extreme circumstances, soldiers must enter a flow state, surrendering to the situation, accepting it, gaining awareness, and making precise choices to save a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Actions include immediate repair mode, administering morphine, replacing blood loss, stemming flow, bandaging, and assessing wounds to extend the time a person remains alive until proper surgery can be arranged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

## The Mental and Physical Toll

Major Jacobs describes a profound incident involving a young, pure-hearted soldier who was deadly in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. During a head-on contact, the soldier was shot; the bullet hit his bulletproof, which then collapsed and cracked his skull with such impact that his eye popped out and was hanging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite this horrific injury, the soldier instinctively killed the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He survived after months of treatment, but for a period, he lost his memory, forgetting his family and who he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. His face was disfigured, he lost an eye, and his engagement broke off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>. He was then assigned a cushy, simple position in a canteen, which disheartened him from his previous identity as a "super soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>. Over many years, he eventually recovered much of his former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.

> [!warning] The Cost of Combat
> In the Special Forces, making a mistake can lead to someone dying or being maimed for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>. This contrasts with civilian life where business failures might lead to financial loss or judgment, but not death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.

## Spiritual and Mental Aspects

The [[mental_and_spiritual_aspects_of_being_a_soldier | spiritual aspect of being a soldier]] is deeply intertwined with facing life-or-death situations constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. Soldiers must transcend duality (life/death, good/bad) and operate entirely in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>. This requires letting go of past experiences and future worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>. This surrender opens up the spiritual aspect of existence, allowing them to operate in a dimension of chaos with focused awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.

Major Jacobs states that his intuition or "sixth sense" developed over time, allowing him to know when something was going to happen in battle, sometimes hours in advance, even if the enemy was not yet in the vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[41:13:00]</a>. This expanded awareness allows them to pick up on relevant information from an infinite amount of data, facilitating survival and effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:44:00">[43:44:00]</a>. This process of letting go of the ego and identifying with a deeper consciousness is akin to what spiritual masters achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>.

Regarding karma, Major Jacobs believes it is a perception: it is real for those whose neural networks are formed to believe in cause and effect, but an illusion for higher consciousnesses that have "zoomed out" of that limited perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>.

## Interactions with Nature and Wildlife

Special Forces personnel often operate in raw nature, like high-altitude mountains and deep forests, far from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>. This constant exposure leads to a merging with nature, not just physically, but also at a deeper conscious or awareness level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>. Major Jacobs shares a story of sitting Sentry duty in pitch darkness when a leopard appeared and sat right next to him, staring at the same spot he was observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:39:00">[59:39:00]</a>. He prepared to fire if attacked but realized there was a shared peace and alignment because neither he nor the leopard were "thinking" but were immersed in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

> [!info] Bears in Indian Forests
> While appearing cute, bears can be extremely terrifying and dangerous, capable of tearing a person apart with immense strength, long sharp claws, and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. A single swipe can remove a scalp or the skin from a face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. The most dangerous bear is a mother with cubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

Major Jacobs describes an encounter with two bears when his team was observing a target area in a forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. After trying to find a path around the soldiers, one bear charged, stopping within two meters, roaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. With his weapon aimed at its head, a local SF soldier behind him flashed a red laser light into the bear's eyes, causing it to stumble backward and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. In such moments of extreme danger, fear vanishes, and soldiers operate purely in a flow state, focusing solely on the immediate action needed for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

## Extreme Environments: Siachen

Major Jacobs describes Siachen as an extremely difficult place to survive and work in, effectively like living inside a fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>. Vegetables become rock solid, water freezes in the air, and sweat turns into icicles on beards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. Exposed skin burns and then loses sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>. Beyond the cold, the environment is full of potential dangers, including enemy raids and artillery shelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>. Artillery shells create "terror in supreme form," as one can hear them whistling closer before they explode, turning molten metal into flying razor blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. The sound of an artillery shell coming directly for you is an indescribable horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>.

## Near-Death Experience and Perception of Reality

Major Jacobs recalls his most intense fear during a mission where he was stuck on a cliff, holding onto grass, with a deep drop below and a waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. An enemy spotted him, and he believed it was "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>. In that moment, he experienced a "life flash," a near-death experience where his entire life appeared before him like a photo album with videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This happened in "no time," a phenomenon of time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. There was no emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt, only detached observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

He attributes his survival to an "alternative form of reality" or a "real illusion," where the exact opposite of what should have happened occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>. He describes reality as a dream in a cosmic mind, where all possibilities exist simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. In critical life-or-death moments, one might shift between these realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. The more intense the combat and life-and-death situations, the more a soldier might find answers to profound questions about existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:05">[01:41:05]</a>. Stepping back and observing life beyond judgment allows for a clearer picture of reality and enables instinctive, effortless choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:47:59]</a>.

## CLAW and Soul of Steel

Post-military, Major Jacobs is involved with CLAW and the "Soul of Steel" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. Soul of Steel combines skill sets and mindsets from military mountaineering and combat experiences with outside adventure and mountaineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. The program teaches skills such as mountain climbing, unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, survival skills, and navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>. These skills are applied in real-world mountain and high-altitude situations, designed to lead participants to realize their own potential and become better, more secure human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>. The ultimate goal of the "human ability biome" is to help individuals realize the "godliness" or supreme consciousness and ability hidden within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>.

Mary Lee, an entrepreneur from China based in Dubai, shares insights into Chinese culture, offering a civilian perspective on various aspects of life in China, including its history, social norms, technology, and interactions with other cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Historical and Societal Foundations

China and India share similarities as two of the world's largest and oldest countries with significant populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Despite geopolitical tensions, a person-to-person conversation can reveal shared values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

### The One-Child Policy
Mary Lee was born under China's One-Child Policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Her communist family strictly adhered to this policy, viewing it as an example for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Non-communist families sometimes tried to hide additional children or pay penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. The policy was lifted over 10 years ago, and now families can have second or even third children without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

Lee defends the policy by contextualizing it within China's post-World War II struggles, particularly food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. She notes that during her grandparents' generation, many children died from hunger, and families struggled to care for large numbers of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>. The government implemented the policy to ensure that children born had access to good food and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:33]</a>.

### Post-War Recovery and Leadership
Following World War II, China, like India, faced immense poverty and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. Education became a major focus for recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Leader Deng Xiaoping (referred to as Mr. D Shaoping) was instrumental in opening up finance and promoting technology and education to rebuild the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

Chinese citizens generally feel proud of their country and love it, including those living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. President Xi Jinping is seen as a "cool guy" who travels to different parts of China, visiting factories, families, and villages to demonstrate government care and push for rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. There are always two opinions on any government, but Chinese people prioritize national pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Both Chinese and Indian governments are seen as doing their best for their vast populations, focusing on improving citizens' lives with initiatives like building toilets, factories, and advanced infrastructure such as high-speed trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

## Cultural Identity and Learning
Chinese students are required to study their culture and history, which is seen as a mandatory part of their education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. History is viewed as repeating itself in different ways, making its study crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. Like Indians, Chinese people are proud of their 5,000+ years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

### English Language
Chinese people recognize India's strong English language skills, which China is now working to improve, especially for global talent and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. English is taught in China from kindergarten, although it wasn't as prevalent in earlier generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

### Historical Perspectives on India and China Relations
The Chinese media and education system generally do not delve deeply into the India-China War of the early 1960s, viewing it as a minor skirmish compared to other conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>. However, recent border clashes like the Galwan conflict are announced in China, similar to how India views its relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. Mary Lee emphasizes that media in both countries often portray the other as a "villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>. As civilians, there is a desire for more direct exchange and positive media to foster friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.

### Cultural and Historical Context of Tibet
From the perspective of ordinary Chinese citizens, Tibet is considered an integral part of China, as shown on maps and official records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>. China is a multicultural nation with 56 different ethnic groups, including Tibetans, Muslims (like those in Xinjiang with Arabic-like writing and Turkic-sounding language), and Mongolians with distinct languages and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:13:00">[56:13:00]</a>. The government supports these regions with free healthcare and nine years of free education for all children, including Tibetans, who can choose to learn Tibetan alongside Mandarin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Mary Lee states that the media's portrayal of China trying to suppress Tibetan language or culture is misinformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. While recognizing the Dalai Lama's presence in India and different political narratives, Chinese citizens believe the local people of Tibet are generally harmonious with other Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

### Cultural Identity and Misconceptions
Mary Lee highlights the problem of [[cultural_and_historical_misinformation_and_its_implications | historical misinformation]] when different countries teach skewed versions of history, often portraying their own country positively while ignoring darker pasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. She stresses the importance of learning from the past to build a better future and promoting peace over conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Chinese people are educated to love and protect their country while respecting other cultures and promoting international relations with humility and kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The focus is on internal growth and development, not on territorial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## Media and Technology
China has banned many popular Western social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. Instead, China has developed its own robust alternatives:
*   **Douyin:** The Chinese version of TikTok, which is not the same as the international TikTok app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Users need to download it from the Chinese Apple Store to see local content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Youku, Bilibili, iQiyi, Tencent:** Chinese equivalents of YouTube and Netflix, offering a wide range of video content and TV series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>.
*   **Weibo:** Similar to Instagram, focusing on pictures, influencers, and vlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.

While these platforms mean Chinese people don't "feel anything" about the banned Western apps, many still use VPNs to access global internet if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>. China is also rapidly advancing in AI and robotics, with major cities like Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing pushing for the development of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. This focus on hardware and internal development distinguishes China's technological growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

## Religion in China
In general, younger generations in China do not adhere to a specific religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:00">[53:16:00]</a>. However, many Chinese people believe in Karma, similar to Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>. The most widely believed religion is Buddhism, largely influenced by cultural narratives like "Journey to the West" (Wukong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This story involves a monk's journey from China to "Tianzhu" (India) to retrieve Buddhist scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Mary Lee notes a growing interest among some Chinese in Indian religions like Hinduism, with some actively learning about gods like Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>. She respects all religions and believes the core message of being a good person and giving love to the world is universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Chinese education instills similar values of kindness, helping others, and self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>. While internationally China is often seen as atheist, the focus is on self-reliance and hard work to improve one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.

## Social Norms and Relationships
[[Dating and social norms in China]] differ significantly from India. Chinese people are generally considered shy and less openly romantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The primary focus is on business, family, and making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Dating Culture:** There's a growing trend, especially among the new generation, towards hook-up culture rather than serious marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. However, arranged marriages were common in the past, particularly in villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:34">[01:30:34]</a>.
*   **Parental Expectations:** Parents traditionally discourage dating during school years to maintain focus on studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24">[01:32:24]</a>. However, immediately after university graduation, pressure begins for children to marry and have kids, especially from family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.
*   **Partner Selection:** Many Chinese, particularly in Mary Lee's generation, prioritize finding a partner who can contribute to a better life and assist with career goals, rather than solely focusing on physical appearance or romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>. While some Chinese girls are perceived as "gold diggers" by Chinese men, many genuinely seek true love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.
*   **Views on Foreigners:** Chinese girls generally prefer partners of their own nationality due to shared culture, food, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>. Chinese men are valued for their strong family values, prioritizing family and avoiding divorce to set good examples for children, which contrasts with the more "open mind" approach seen in some Western cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>.

## Food Culture
China offers many vegetarian options, especially in big cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. While communication can be a barrier in smaller cities, big cities have clear communication where one can request vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. Chinese airlines also offer special vegetarian meals upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:54">[01:18:54]</a>. Mary Lee herself was a vegetarian as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. There are specific regions like Ningxia where the population is predominantly Muslim and vegetarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. Chinese cuisine even features vegetarian restaurants that create tofu dishes tasting like meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

Chinese people traveling to India are often curious about Indian street food, but it's noted that hygiene can be an issue for foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

## Bollywood and Celebrities
Bollywood movies have a significant following in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. Aamir Khan is particularly popular, largely due to the success of his movie *Dangal*, which earned more in China than in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Other actors like Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan are also recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Chinese viewers find the spontaneous song and dance sequences in Bollywood films unique and amusing, as they are not common in other international cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Taylor Swift is also very popular in China, attracting a wide age range of fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

Currently, India's billionaire Ambani family, particularly the wedding of Anant Ambani, has garnered significant attention in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>. The family is respected for their business growth, hard work, and philanthropic efforts, which are seen as contributing to India's modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

[[Adapting and thriving in different cultural environments | Adapting and thriving in different cultural environments]] is key for Mary Lee, who, despite growing up in China, has lived in Dubai for over seven years, which has given her a broad understanding of both Indian and Chinese civilian perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

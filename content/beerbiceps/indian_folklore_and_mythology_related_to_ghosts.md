Indian folklore and mythology include a rich variety of supernatural entities, each with unique origins and characteristics. These traditions often intertwine with beliefs about death, unfulfilled desires, and the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Types of Supernatural Entities

### Chudel and Dian
Chudels and Dians are female entities with a similar origin theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is believed that a woman who dies during childbirth or while pregnant, and is not properly cremated with all necessary rituals, may turn into a Chudel or Dian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Driven by latent desires, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These entities are considered vengeful, akin to a type of witch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Yakshin
Yakshin are demigoddesses believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven, known as Alkapuri, governed by Kubar (Kubera), the brother of the demon king Ravana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. When Yakshin come to Earth, they often appear in evil forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. They are initially beautiful and voluptuous, using seduction, but later reveal an evil form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Their victims are typically men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Many folklore tales describe sightings of Yakshin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Pishach
The Pishach is a ghoul from Hindu mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. It is believed to be created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Unlike some other entities, Pishachs are considered capable of killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Betal
A Betal is described as a hanging ghost, a ghost that hangs from a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This entity is believed to be a man who died with unfulfilled wishes and remains attached to a permanent structure like a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Betals are said to haunt passersby, sometimes even traveling with them to their homes and disrupting their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### Poltergeists
Poltergeists are categorized as noisy ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They are not considered evil but are mischievous and naughty, trying to disorient people and sap their energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Poltergeists rarely kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Nature of Ghosts and Hauntings
The realm of ghosts is often described as full of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Spiritual and philosophical books suggest that when someone experiences an unnatural death before their destined time, they spend the remainder of that time as a ghost in this realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

While many ghosts are believed to be good, the evil ones are typically those who had something unfulfilled in their lives or died an unjust or violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

[[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | Paranormal energies]] are believed to be all around us, existing in another dimension that we cannot interact with, though they can perceive us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Trees and Spirits
In India, it is a common belief that trees can house spirits and serve as a safe haven for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. People are often advised not to urinate on trees or walk under certain types of trees, especially banyan and peepal trees, at night, due to the belief that entities like Betals may reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Haunted Objects
Objects can also become haunted, carrying spirits. An example mentioned is a harmless-looking cup bought from a foreign country that was found to be possessed by a spirit and caused a terrible motorcycle accident for its owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This concept is also seen in Western [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | paranormal lore]], such as the artifacts in the Warren's museum, including the Annabelle doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Countering Dark Energies
Spiritual practices are often cited as ways to counter or cleanse dark energies and [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | supernatural entities]]. These methods include chanting, meditation, and salt water baths, which are believed to wash off negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Identifying the root cause of a haunting, which can sometimes be human mischief or a possessed object, is also part of addressing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Cultural Beliefs and Research
[[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | Cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits]] are deeply ingrained, with many individuals believing in the existence of ghosts and the [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | occult]]. Horror writers, like Neil D Silva, often draw from personal [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | experiences and narratives involving ghosts and hauntings]] or research into paranormal phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Paranormal investigators, though differing in their specific theories, dedicate efforts to uncovering the truth behind these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Some, like Jay Alani, focus on distinguishing genuine paranormal activity from superstition and commercially propagated beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Others, like Sarbajit, believe in the pervasive presence of paranormal energies as a co-existing dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Delhi is considered one of the most haunted cities due to its age and history of battles, leading to an accumulation of angst and pain from the ghosts of its past inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

### Witchcraft
[[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | Witchcraft]] is also a recognized element within Indian spiritualism. The village of Mayong in Assam is widely believed to be the birthplace of black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. However, in Mayong, black magic is often practiced for healing purposes, with tantrics and ojas using mantras to spiritually cleanse individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. This highlights a distinction between positive and negative uses of such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Bengal is another Indian state noted for its strong association with [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | witchcraft]] and horror literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Observations
[[personal_ghost_stories | Personal ghost stories]] are common, with individuals reporting experiences such as feeling cold presences, flickering lights, or vivid, disturbing dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Fear of the dark and of death is a common thread among those drawn to horror as an art form, suggesting that confronting these fears through creation can be a form of catharsis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

A notable [[experiences_and_narratives_involving_ghosts_and_hauntings | experience]] includes a village in Bhubaneswar where young men would mysteriously wake up, walk to a specific tree in a forest, and hang themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Paranormal investigators detected a mass of dark energy around the tree, and psychics reported seeing forms and feeling sadness associated with the tree, which villagers found impossible to cut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Technology like K2 meters can detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) which are sometimes inferred to be related to ghostly presence, but this doesn't provide direct visual proof of entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Despite the lack of definitive scientific proof, many believe that a "science" exists behind paranormal phenomena that has not yet been fully researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

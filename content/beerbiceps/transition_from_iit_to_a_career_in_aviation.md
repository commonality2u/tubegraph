Gaurav Taneja, known for his YouTube channels "Flying Beast" and "Fit Muscle TV," is also a pilot and an alumnus of IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. His career path involved a significant transition from a highly sought-after engineering background to pursuing his passion for aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Early Aspirations and IIT Enrollment

Taneja initially aspired to become a pilot after completing 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, due to his family's financial situation not being strong enough at the time, this dream was put on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He then entered the competitive race for engineering and medical professions, undertaking coaching in Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Despite the shift, he found a deep passion for physics and mathematics, often studying until 3 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. His dedication to hard work led him to aim for and successfully gain admission to IIT, one of the country's top institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Revival of a Dream

While at IIT, his original passion for flying resurfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This led him to make the bold decision to pursue a career in aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His father initially wanted him to go to the U.S. for his master's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, Taneja convinced him to trust his instincts, stating, "Trust me on this feeling, let me do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. His father ultimately supported his decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Passion and Professional Fulfillment

Gaurav Taneja expresses immense satisfaction with his career as a pilot, stating that he feels "very happy" and never feels like he's "working" when he goes to his profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This aligns with his overall [[life_advice_for_aspiring_engineers_and_young_individuals | philosophy]] of pursuing what one loves, as he compares it to kids eagerly playing cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

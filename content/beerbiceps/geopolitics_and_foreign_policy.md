[[Geopolitics and global conflicts|Geopolitics]] and foreign policy have seen a surge in public interest, particularly in recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This growing engagement is attributed to increased global connectivity through technology like smartphones, which expose individuals to global content and comparisons, fostering a sense of [[geopolitics_and_global_conflicts | globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Dr. Jaishankar's Perspective

As India's Minister of External Affairs, Dr. S. Jaishankar notes that he has transitioned from being primarily a diplomat to a political figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. He emphasizes a diplomatic approach of being pleasant to those who are pleasant to him, but a readiness to "push back" when India is pushed or disrespected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. He views himself as the "personification of India on a global scale," implying that an attack on him is an attack on the collective "eye" of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

He attributes his insights in [[Geopolitics and global conflicts|geopolitics]] to a combination of experience and hard work, similar to how athletes study their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. He describes this as an "instinct" or "sixth sense" developed through competitive engagement and pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## India's Foreign Policy Challenges

India faces a complex global environment, dealing with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic consequences of the Ukraine conflict, which impacted energy, food, and fertilizer prices globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Domestically, there are ongoing border issues with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a> and long-standing problems with Pakistan regarding terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

Foreign policy is not merely an academic exercise; it directly impacts the lives of everyday citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Dr. Jaishankar's aim is to make foreign policy personally relevant to Indians by:
*   Securing them when they travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   Assisting them when they encounter problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring students can work while studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.
*   Reducing visa waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

## The Role of Economic Strength in Geopolitics

Economic strength is a fundamental aspect of [[Geopolitics and global conflicts|geopolitics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Countries must be fundamentally competitive, meaning they need strong factories, entrepreneurship, businesses, startups, agriculture, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Without these internal strengths, a nation risks being outpaced by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

The global landscape is competitive, with nations constantly vying for position, even among allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Therefore, the focus for young people should be on building national strengths through initiatives like "Make in India," "Startup India," and "Gati Shakti" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Investing in smart ports, good roads, and rapid goods movement is crucial for manufacturing and job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Foreign policy also plays a role in marketing and branding India as a responsible and safe business destination, attracting investment and fostering opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

## [[Technologys impact on geopolitics | Technology's Impact on Geopolitics]]

[[Technologys impact on geopolitics | Technology]] significantly influences foreign policy and [[Geopolitics and global conflicts|geopolitics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. Individuals are "walking emitters of electronic patterns" through their digital activities, creating massive amounts of data that can be processed to gain strategic advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

While quantum computing is discussed, the immediate focus in [[Geopolitics and global conflicts|geopolitical]] discussions is on semiconductors and the ongoing "Chip War" or "Tech War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of "trusted collaboration" among like-minded nations (market economies, democracies with ethical companies) to create secure supply chains for critical technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. Chips are considered the "new oil" in this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>.

## The Future of Talent Mobility: "Brain Circulation"

Prime Minister Modi encourages Indians to view the world as a "global workplace," where work opportunities are not geographically restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. Foreign policy, in this context, aims to open doors for talented Indians seeking global opportunities, whether in blue-collar, professional, or merchant shipping jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>.

There is a significant demand for "trusted talent" â€“ skilled, talented individuals who adhere to international business rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>. This has led to mobility agreements with various countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.

Dr. Jaishankar redefines the "brain drain" concept, suggesting that the world is now a "membrane" where people can move in and out freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. This "brain circulation" means that committing to a foreign country for an entire life is no longer the norm, and opportunities in India are increasingly becoming competitive with those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>. The recent example of Apple investing in India indicates an improved business atmosphere, quality talent, and a validation of India's manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of [[Indias Foreign Policy | India's Foreign Policy]]

Under Prime Minister Modi, [[Indias Foreign Policy | India's foreign policy]] has undergone a "personally transformational" and "radical" churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Modi's unique leadership combines a grand strategic vision with an acute attention to detail, enabling him to challenge and innovate at both macro and micro levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Message to the Youth

Dr. Jaishankar encourages young Indians to cultivate self-belief in this new era of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. He stresses that national choices and personal choices are interconnected; a sound national choice can expand individual opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>. For those in their early twenties, a vast world of possibilities awaits, and it is the obligation of current leaders to facilitate and prepare the ground for these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>.

For content creators and "early thought leaders," he emphasizes that leadership can emerge from young individuals, and older generations can relate to confident youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

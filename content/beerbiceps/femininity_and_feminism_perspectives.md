Nora Fatehi shares her perspectives on relationships, gender roles, and the impact of modern feminism, emphasizing the need for mutual reliance between men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

## Belief in Love and the Industry
Fatehi believes in love, stating that nothing is worse than marrying someone you don't love and living with them for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. She observes that many people in her industry engage in "nonsense" marriages for reasons like clout, networking, or relevancy, which she considers a form of predatory behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This sacrifice of personal life and mental health for career and fame leads to unhappiness, depression, and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Critique of Feminism
Fatehi explicitly states she does not believe in the modern concept of feminism, asserting that it has "f\*\*ked up our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. She argues against the idea of complete independence, which she believes has destroyed family units and the feminine energy of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### Traditional Gender Roles
Fatehi advocates for traditional gender dynamics, where men are providers and breadwinners, and women are nurturers, wives, and mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. She believes that while women should be independent and have careers, they should also be ready to embrace roles as mothers and wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. This perspective, though considered "old school," is, to her, the "normal way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. She suggests that society's current chaos stems from extreme ideologies, and a return to moderation and acceptance of biological roles would bring balance and reduce mental health issues like depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

### Hormonal Differences
Fatehi's views align with a video discussing female physiology, which suggests that women's hormonal cycles (28-day cycle) are not suited for the traditional 9-to-5 workday structure designed for men's 24-hour testosterone cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This mismatch can lead to burnout and feeling "broken, lazy, or not strong enough" in corporate settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Women naturally need more sleep, are more creative, and require schedule variation to accommodate hormonal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

## Observations on Men and Women
Fatehi notes that both men and women have complexities. She believes that men need to tap into their masculine energy to be providers, supporters, and protectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. She observes that many modern men have been "brainwashed" by feminism, leading them to compete with women in all aspects, rather than focusing on their traditional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

She also has strong views on women, stating, "girls are not sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>. She asserts that many women can be manipulative, conniving, and are "great actors in real life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>. Some girls will lie or portray a false reality to get what they want, especially when rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>. This includes emotional manipulation, changing perceptions, or altering the course of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>.

## Personal Experience and Dating
Fatehi's personal experiences, including a "terrible experience" in a past relationship that was "deeper, darker, scarier" than cheating, have led her to build a protective barrier around herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>. She currently avoids dating to protect her aura and spirit and to focus on her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

When seeking a partner, she desires stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. An age gap can be an issue, as someone significantly younger may not be in the same life phase of seeking a stable relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. While she is currently single and wants to be a mom and wife, she is figuring out how to balance these desires with her global career ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

From her experience as a North African woman, she finds Indian men similar to Middle Eastern and African men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

## Parental Responsibility and Intuition
Fatehi emphasizes the importance of parents educating their children about various human behaviors, including manipulative ones, to strengthen their intuition and help them filter out negative influences as they grow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. She believes intuition is a key to navigating life, and that by being self-aware and listening to one's inner voice, individuals can make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>.

From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The earthly realm is described as a "playground of possibilities" where every imaginable scenario, good and bad, is allowed to unfold. It is a place where beings from various realms can incarnate, and where spiritual evolution can occur at an accelerated pace due to the compressed nature of time compared to other planes of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:37">[03:32:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:21:00">[42:21:00]</a>. This plane also holds the maximum amount of Maya, the force that can cause delusion and pull individuals away from spiritual reality through materialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:00">[43:01:00]</a>.

## Higher Beings and Deities

[[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | Higher beings and entities]], referred to as 'Deities' or 'Devatas', are central to spiritual understanding and practice. They exist at levels beyond human suffering and are considered eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Worshiping them can lead to a reflection of their qualities and transcendence of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Mahakal
The term "Mahakal" was popularized for some in Mumbai through a Virat Kohli video, which inspired curiosity about this deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Mahakal is described as the highest form of Bhairav, with no difference between Shiva and Bhairav, only appearing different due to Shiva's Maya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. He represents time personified and exists at the "Last Frontier of your imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, able to take any shape or form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Mahakal practices among Buddhists are also noted, particularly after an 11th-century monk introduced them to Tibet, where Mahakal became a primary guardian deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Powerful figures, including kings and ministers throughout history, have been drawn to temples like the Mahakal Mandir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### Bhairav and Kalabhairav
Bhairav is an aggressive, intense form of Shiva, deeply connected to cremation grounds and having control over the manner and time of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Kalabhairav is the primary form of Bhairav, who manifested from Shiva's anger to cut off Brahma's fifth head due to Brahma's arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This act, known as 'Brahmāhatyā', led Kalabhairav to undertake a penance, eventually settling in Kashi as its guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Kalabhairav sustains, creates, and can destroy sins, washing away karmas and, through "Bhairav Yatana," can accelerate the experience of karmic consequences to lead to liberation and enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. He makes one fearless of circumstances, not just ghosts, by enabling acceptance of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Bhairav, unlike Shiva in his static state, is a very active deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Bhairav upasana was historically prominent in Kashmir but has since been "relegated" to a peripheral guardian role in many traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

### Kali
Kali is described as even more intense than Mahakal in her *krama* (path) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. She is the Divine Mother, beyond the *Trigunas* (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas), capable of assuming any *guna* as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Other Deities
*   **Shiva**: Often viewed as a peaceful, calm, and auspicious deity, embodying the static state of realization. His *shakti* (divine feminine power) is seen as external to him, creating and running the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Nila Saraswati**: One of the forms of the Mother, she creates spontaneous knowledge that bursts forth from within, akin to enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Anubis**: The Egyptian deity with the face of a dog/jackal, who guides souls after death, is seen as a parallel to Bhairav in different cultures, suggesting deities can appear in various forms across cultures based on local understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Chakrasamvara**: Believed to be the Buddhist version of Shiva due to residing on Mount Kailash with a red and blue representation for him and his consort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Deity Withdrawal and Re-emergence
Deities can choose to withdraw from active participation in the human world for periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. When a deity withdraws, the birth of great *siddhas* (enlightened beings) connected to them stops, and overall human connection to that deity diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Conversely, a deity's re-emergence is marked by the birth of such *siddhas* who can awaken the masses and re-establish a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Some deities may never have been active in the human world, preferring no interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Lower Beings and Negative Entities

[[types_of_spiritual_beings_and_their_influences | Lower beings]] can also incarnate on Earth, often manifesting as individuals who cause great evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. These are reincarnations of beings previously in a lower realm, choosing Earth because things happen very fast here, allowing for quicker changes in destiny over a few lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. They often possess an innate desire for quick gains, which makes them susceptible to the influence of negative entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

*   **Manifestations of Evil**: Individuals like Stalin and Hitler are cited as examples of such beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Sri Aurobindo, in his writings, specifically referred to Stalin as an "Asura" (demon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Hitler was reportedly influenced by a being he called "the Lord of Nations," and an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | exorcism]] was attempted on him by the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The greater the evil, the greater the damage it causes, aiming to leave a "dent in humanity" on a mass scale, not just harming individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. These beings operate outside human morality and love cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Influence of Demonic Entities**: [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | Demonic entities]] can easily influence humans, especially those with deep cravings for sex, money, or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. They exploit these desires, leading individuals to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the "Illuminati conspiracy" where powerful people are believed to be governed by such entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. These entities, while having their own agendas, can be invoked for quick gains in exchange for a "pound of flesh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Vashikanya and Pishachas**: "Vashikanya" refers to feminine energies with the capacity to destroy through physical intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. These energies can be invoked within human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Practices involving human feces are described as "dirty" and are associated with the worship of very negative beings called "Pishachas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Such practices are part of a school of thought related to negative entities, previously discussed in an episode on *rakshasas* and *asuras* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Atheism**: Atheists are considered part of this playground of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. From a philosophical perspective, they serve as a counterbalance, allowing for the understanding of faith through contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. As long as atheists do not obstruct the spiritual practices of others and maintain basic respect, their disbelief is seen as irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Even lower beings pray to their respective deities according to their tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, seeking powers for evil, as seen with *asuras* performing fierce *sadhanas* to challenge gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Human Agency, Karma, and Reality

Humans play a role in shaping reality, contributing at their individual levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The concept of free will versus destiny is a complex intertwining that is difficult for the average individual to discern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Nature provides intelligence and judgment, expecting humans to act based on them, rather than dwelling on whether outcomes are predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Karma is a constant feedback loop based on present and past actions, creating constraints but not a fixed destiny, as continuous effort can modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

*   **Fixed vs. Fluid Karma**: Some aspects of life, like birth and death, are considered "fixed karmas" determined at birth and unchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. However, other aspects, like work, residence, and relationships, are more fluid and can be influenced by current actions interacting with the momentum of past karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Dreams and Reality**: Dreams are classified into three types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>:
    1.  **Subconscious Junk**: 60% of dreams, originating from random thoughts and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
    2.  **Unacknowledged Reality**: Reflecting real-life situations that the conscious mind ignores, revealed during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
    3.  **From Higher Realities**:
        *   **Lower Astral Plane**: Dreams from this realm are accurate, manifesting quickly (within days to a month), but can be altered by corrective measures, like taking precautions to avoid an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
        *   **Spiritual Planes (Gods' Realm)**: The rarest and most powerful dreams, these take years to manifest but are unchangeable and nothing in the universe can stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. They commonly occur to those involved in [[spiritual_practices_and_their_influence_on_astrology | spiritual practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Animal dreams are often metaphorical, reflecting subconscious acknowledgments of life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, unless influenced by external factors like reading or working with animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Genius and Higher Beings**: [[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | Higher beings]] born in the earthly realm, often unknowingly, manifest innate capacities as genius-level talent that is beyond imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Despite their extraordinary abilities, they may struggle with adjustment issues, leading to rude or arrogant behavior, mental disorders, or extreme social isolation/promiscuity, reflecting an internal loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Tantra's Perspective

Tantra is a path for accelerating activity to attain perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Unlike some philosophies that reject Maya (material reality) as false, Tantra views Maya as the body of the Divine Mother, a constricted manifestation of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The goal is to see through the constriction to the larger manifestation of the divine, appreciating and finding meaning in this realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

*   **Desire and Detachment**: Desire (Kama) is fundamental to life and is considered good within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The Mother of all desires is Kamakhya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Tantra seeks to use the very things that are thought to cause downfall (like sex, money, and power) to ascend spiritually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Bhairav's blessing of detachment helps cultivate higher desires by freeing the mind from lower desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Three Most Powerful Shaktis**: Sex, money, and power are identified as the three most powerful *shaktis* (forces/energies) governing everything, and destinies are connected to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. A person who transcends these three becomes a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Indiscriminate use of these leads to corruption, poor discrimination, and eventually mistakes and self-injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Tantric Paths**:
    *   **Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path)**: Involves restrictions on food (satvic diet) and physical intimacy, but allows the use of all mantras and yantras in a satvic manner. Most Puja practices in Hindu homes are considered Dakshinachara Tantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Vamachara (Left-Hand Path)**: Entered after mastering Dakshinachara, this path involves offering and consuming "Panchamakara" (meat, fish, alcohol etc.) to the deity. The philosophy is to master even those aspects traditionally denied or considered "dark" to achieve perfection in all aspects of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Sanctified alcohol (*Karan*) is offered to the Mother and consumed as *Prasad* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The consumption must be disciplined, not for intoxication, but to use its *shakti* as a spiritual boost, enabling continued mantra *japa* and Puja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This path should only be entered after lifetimes of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Offerings like cigarettes to Kalabhairav temples are local flavors without *shastric* basis, unlike alcohol which is clearly sanctioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Initiation**: For full Tantra Sadhana, a proper initiation (Abhisheka Diksha) by a qualified guru is required. This Puja is performed to remove obstacles from the disciple's path to worship deities like the Mahavidyas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Vak Siddhi**: An accomplishment in speech where whatever an individual says, knowingly or unknowingly, manifests into reality, as nature ensures it comes true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This is a capacity acquired when the body becomes the *yantra*, the mind becomes the *mantra*, and the deity acts through the individual's speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Companionship**: For an *upasaka*, having a partner who understands and ideally practices is highly beneficial, as complimentary practices can provide the freedom needed for intense sadhanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The earthly realm is a complex and dynamic stage influenced by both [[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | higher beings and entities]] and [[dealing_with_entities_and_dark_forces | dark forces]], where human free will interacts with [[the_influence_of_astrological_charts_and_destiny_on_life | destiny and karma]]. Tantra offers a unique approach to navigating this reality, embracing all aspects of existence—light and dark, pleasure and pain—as opportunities for spiritual growth and the attainment of ultimate power, rather than rejecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This perspective, rooted in [[influence_of_ancient_hindu_teachings_on_modern_spirituality | ancient Hindu teachings]], emphasizes that the Divine is present everywhere, and true spiritual practice aims to realize this presence and integrate it into one's being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

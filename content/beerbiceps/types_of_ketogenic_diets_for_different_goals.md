The [[ketogenic_diet_benefits_and_challenges | ketogenic diet]] is a very low-carb diet that forces the body to burn fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. To achieve ketosis, it's crucial to stay below 20 grams of overall carbohydrates per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This means carefully accounting for every single food item consumed, even small things like garlic pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Sugary carbs are to be avoided entirely, including those found in onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

While many myths surround the [[ketogenic_diet_benefits_and_challenges | ketogenic diet]], scientifically, it's considered the most effective fat-burning diet in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This is because by cutting off carbohydrates, the body depletes its glucose and glycogen stores and then begins breaking down its own fat into Ketone bodies for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Ketone bodies provide more energy per gram than glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

For any [[dietbased_weight_loss_strategies | weight loss]] to occur, a caloric deficit must be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The diet should be followed for a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 3 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Two Main Types of Ketogenic Diets

There are two primary approaches to the [[ketogenic_diet_benefits_and_challenges | ketogenic diet]], depending on an individual's goals:

### 1. Textbook Ketogenic Diet

This version is designed for the average person primarily seeking to burn fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:09">[07:07:09]</a>.

*   **Calorie Distribution:**
    *   60% to 70% from fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:21">[07:17:21]</a>
    *   No more than 5% from carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>
    *   The remaining percentage from protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>
*   **Goal:** Rapid fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:31">[07:29:31]</a>.
*   **Application:** Ideal for general fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:09">[07:07:09]</a>.

### 2. Ketogenic Diet for Gym-goers/Bodybuilders

This approach is for individuals who have already built substantial muscle mass and are looking to get leaner, focusing on fat burning while conserving muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

*   **Calorie Distribution:**
    *   Focus on hitting approximately 80% of your daily protein goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
    *   The remaining calories should come from fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   **Goals:** Burn fat and conserve strength and muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:03">[08:06:03]</a>.
*   **Application:** Ideal for "bulky Bros" looking to get cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation:** After being on ketosis for a while, appetite may decrease, allowing for a further reduction in protein intake while still burning fat and conserving muscle and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:58">[07:57:58]</a>.

## General Considerations for Any Ketogenic Diet

Regardless of the type, certain aspects of the [[basics_of_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] remain consistent:

*   **Food Intake:** [[foods_to_eat_and_avoid_on_a_ketogenic_diet | Homemade food]] is highly recommended, ideally prepared by yourself, to ensure strict carb control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Allowed:** Non-vegetarian items (red meat, chicken, eggs, fish), liberal amounts of healthy fats (oil, ghee, coconut oil, butter, animal fat), and specific low-carb vegetables (leafy greens like spinach, cabbage, lettuce, broccoli, zucchini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Vegetables are crucial for nutrition and preventing constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Avoid:** Processed foods, fruit, junk food, processed cheese, paneer, milk products, and most nuts due to their carbohydrate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **[[potential_downside_of_ketogenic_diet | Downsides]]:**
    *   **Strength Decrease:** As with any cutting [[dietbased_weight_loss_strategies | diet]], some strength loss is expected when losing [[dietbased_weight_loss_strategies | weight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Limited Muscle Building:** It's primarily a fat-burning [[dietbased_weight_loss_strategies | diet]] and not conducive to building significant muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
    *   **[[potential_downside_of_ketogenic_diet | Keto Flu]]:** This is a common experience during the initial phase, characterized by nausea, headaches, and fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. It occurs as the body drains glycogen from muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Working out can help reduce its duration by speeding up glycogen depletion and entry into ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_refeed_days_in_ketogenic_diet | Refeed Days]] (Carb-up Days):** Every 10 to 14 days, a refeed day can be incorporated where carb intake can go up to 400-500 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Crucially, these carbs must not come from sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This allows for a "cheat meal" without sugar, incorporating items like rice or bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

Overall, the [[ketogenic_diet_benefits_and_challenges | ketogenic diet]] can be highly beneficial for health within its recommended duration, despite misconceptions about its long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

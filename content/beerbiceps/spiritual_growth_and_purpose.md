This article explores the insights of Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader, on various aspects of [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual growth]], the purpose of life, and the nature of reality. The discussion covers his personal journey, the role of a Guru, the mechanics of Kriya Yoga and Kundalini, and the existence of other dimensions and beings.

## Introduction to Shri M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

Shri M is recognized as a spiritual leader and author whose life experiences span from encounters with mythical creatures to profound philosophical discussions on the meaning of [[spiritual_growth_and_purpose | spiritual growth]] in terms of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This conversation aims to open the mind and explore his unique journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.

## Shri M's Personal Spiritual Journey

Shri M's journey began at a young age, marked by extraordinary experiences and a deep quest for ultimate happiness.

### Early Life and Earliest Memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

Shri M recalls his earliest memories in his physical body are normal up until the age of nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. After his Guru, Maheshwar Babaji, laid a hand on his head, he began to have memories from *before* this life, including being an embryo with past memories flooding in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. These memories then disappeared, leaving him with only those of his current life until he started delving into his consciousness to trace back his origins and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Krishna in the Gita states that he is the one who gives and wipes out memories, a process that happens to everyone, though some discover these past memories later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Shri M was born into an immigrant Muslim family in Kerala, India, whose forefathers came as security guards to the Maharajas of Travancore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. He considers himself a Keralite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Meeting His Guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

At nine years old, Shri M encountered a tall, matted-haired, fair-skinned person with a huge Rudraksha garland in his backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Despite initial fear, he felt compelled to approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The stranger, who would later be known as his Guru, put his hand on Shri M's head and said, "When the time comes, you will remember everything. Everything will be fine. Go back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The stranger's large, haunting eyes remained etched in his memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

From that day, Shri M's life began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He started meditating, experiencing a warm, blissful feeling spreading through his body at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This became a daily practice, leading him to understand many things and develop a desire to read ancient texts like the Upanishads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. He also started meeting various [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual]] persons, including yogis and swamis, who provided him with blessings and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### The Himalayan Quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>

By age 19, Shri M felt a strong desire for a tangible [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual experience]] and believed someone was waiting for him in the Himalayas to teach him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Feeling trapped in a "golden cage" at home, he decided to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Without maps or Google, he used railway guides to plan his journey to Rishikesh and then walked for over a month to Badrinath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

During this arduous journey, he met various people, from sincere yogis to cannabis-smoking individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. An elderly sadhu warned him about the dangers of renouncing the world without true readiness, emphasizing that a fall from a higher spiritual step could be irrecoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

In Badrinath, he sought guidance from the Rawal (chief priest of the Badrinath Temple) but received a discouraging response, being told to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Feeling disillusioned and contemplating suicide at the edge of the Alakananda river, he decided to meditate first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. It was then that he encountered his Guru, Maheshwar Babaji, again near Vyas Gufa (Vyas Cave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

### Training with the Guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>

Shri M stayed with his Guru for almost three and a half years, wandering with him and learning extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. His Guru taught him what might take a university ten years to cover, all from his knowledge without books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Shri M quickly realized his Guru was no ordinary man, often knowing his thoughts before he expressed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. During this period, Shri M underwent an intensive "crash course," learning various Indian philosophical schools (Darshanas) like Samkhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Vedanta, and Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. His Guru prepared him for a future teaching assignment, emphasizing the need to understand different fields to relate to various people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

## The Role of a Guru

> [!INFO] **Guru-Disciple Relationship**
> Shri M believes that when a student is truly ready and deeply desires a teacher, the Guru will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. He emphasizes that this desire must be sincere and one-pointed, a feeling akin to "I'm going to die if I don't get a proper guide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. A Guru's function can end, and they may leave, and there's no harm in a disciple seeking guidance elsewhere if it aids their [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

## Understanding Spiritual Practices

### Kriya Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>

Shri M's primary practice was Kriya Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. The word "Kriya" in the Yoga Shastras simply means "practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The specific Kriya teachings Shri M received come from the lineage of Sri Guru Babaji (also known as Maha Avatar Babaji), who is believed to exist for a very long time, even till the end of the Kali Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Maharishi Patanjali, a renowned Yogi, often referred to him as "the one who lives forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

Kriya Yoga is a systematic and methodical way of transcending the ordinary, considered one of the fastest forms of [[spiritual_evolution_and_guidance | spiritual advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. However, its effectiveness depends on following "Yamas" (rules and regulations), diligent practice, and careful application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. Kriya helps raise awareness from the gross (physical energy) to the subtle, focusing attention on the spine (Merudand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. This process refines the mind until it understands the origin of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

After years of practice, Shri M enjoys Kriya and finds it has opened many dimensions to his mind, allowing him to shift his mind from lower to higher levels of consciousness at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. He explains that when the mind is free, it reflects Divinity, which is not an external concept but the divine spark existing within us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

### Kundalini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>

Shri M prefers to avoid the term "Kundalini" due to its exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. In Yoga Tantras, Kundalini refers to the complete energy of the universe, depicted as a feminine, creative energy (Parashakti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. This energy first operates as sex, being the same energy but expressed differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. After procreation, this energy resides at the base of the spine in the Muladhara (lowest chakra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

A Yogi's practice involves controlling this energy and directing it upward along the spine, transforming it from a physically creative energy into a [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritually creative energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. Kriya is one practice to turn this energy around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The time it takes for Kundalini to awaken varies based on an individual's [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | stage of growth]] and past life efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Shri M cautions that while rapid awakening can occur, a slower, more mature process is safer, as the powerful energy can overwhelm the mind and body if unprepared, potentially leading to mental instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. He expresses concern about teachers who provide techniques without proper preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

### Kundalini, Enlightenment, and Moksha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>

According to Yoga Shastras, Kundalini rising to the Sahasrara (crown chakra) leads to Moksha or enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. However, Shri M notes that some individuals achieve illumination without systematic Kriya practice, often due to purified minds from many past lives, where the energy awakens in other centers like the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Such individuals might find their true identity by asking fundamental questions like "Who am I?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] **The Third Eye and Pineal Gland**
> The "third eye," often depicted in Shiva's image, symbolizes a special faculty required to understand concepts beyond ordinary dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. It signifies that our regular sense organs cannot perceive beyond the third dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
>
> The pineal gland, once considered a vestigial organ, is now known for its role in the circadian rhythm (sleep and waking cycle) through melatonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Shri M connects it to deep sleep (Shukti) and the border of Turiya (a state of pure bliss), suggesting that meditation and attention to this area can lead from deep sleep into Turiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. He believes the pineal gland's hormone release can be controlled consciously through visualization, one-pointed attention, and balancing the breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. The Gita's sixth chapter (Dhyana Yoga) describes a meditation similar to Kriya, instructing to sit straight, fix attention between the eyebrows, and equalize the breath to attain freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## The Nature of Reality

### Higher Beings and Dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>

Shri M states that he *knows* rather than *believes* in the existence of higher beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. He finds it limited to think that only humans exist on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Just as we don't see air but it exists, many beings exist beyond our perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. These beings can be around, encouraging, and helping, especially during prayer or meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. Their frequency of vibration is different from ours, which is why we don't perceive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Some can see us, but not all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Ghosts**
> Shri M explains that what people perceive as ghosts are generally electric charges that remain from a human body after a sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. These charges, having acquired the body's shape, can be visible under special circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. However, they possess no intelligence and cannot intentionally harm; any harm comes from one's own fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. He believes that 90% of possession cases are psychological diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

> [!WARNING] **Negative Influences**
> While higher beings are not inherently negative, some can increase desires (e.g., sexual desires), which can be detrimental for a spiritual seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. These "naughty elements" can infuse thoughts, making them seem like one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Traditional meditation practices include drawing a protective mental circle to keep such thoughts away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

### The Yeti Encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>

Shri M recounts an experience during an unsuccessful attempt to reach Kailash with his Guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. Stricken with a severe fever in a remote village, he awoke to find a huge, furry, human-like figure standing in his tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. The creature made an eerie sound, stuffed a bitter herbal medicine into his mouth, and then ran off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. His Guru later confirmed it was a Yeti, stating it came to save him from the fatal mountain fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. Shri M's Guru noted that Yetis "are good people; they are not what people think and fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. This experience confirmed for Shri M the existence of living creatures in remote mountains and forests that humans don't often believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

### The Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>

Shri M discusses Nagas, referring to hooded serpents, specifically cobras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. He explains that ancient Nagas belonged to a species of beings from another realm who were once teachers to humans, worshipped as symbols of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. The Kundalini energy itself is also considered Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. The cobras we see today are "decadent leftovers" of that species, as many ancient Nagas returned to their realm, Nagaloka, after having relationships with human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52">[01:24:52]</a>. While not as intelligent as their ancestors, cobras are more intelligent than common snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. Shri M notes that cobras recognize individuals with active Kundalini and do not bite unless threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.

### Dimensions and Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>

The concept of Shiva is described as an abstract concept representing the dimension beyond human understanding, the ultimate essence of all dimensions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. Shiva, meaning "bliss" and "auspiciousness," is the Supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. To understand dimensions beyond the third, one needs to awaken special faculties beyond ordinary senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

Time, according to Shri M, is based on change; without change, there would be no time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. It is a relative and psychological concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Understanding time fully means going beyond it, realizing that the clock's time is not the real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

## The Purpose of Life and Human Evolution

Shri M states that his [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth_and_societal_evolution | purpose in this life]] is to make people understand that a divine element exists in every living being, especially humans, who can recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>. This divine element is the essence of our being, and the aim of life is to turn our minds around to find it, taking humanity from the ordinary to that which is beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.

He believes the human race must [[spiritual_evolution_and_guidance | evolve further]], as we are still in an early stage of civilization, needing to go beyond our current frontal lobe-dominated existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

## Advice for [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | Personal Growth and Purpose]]

Shri M advises to continue exploring diverse topics and engaging with people from all walks of life, but always keep the [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_and_professional_life | spiritual aspect]] as a very important part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. He emphasizes that the ultimate aim of life is to expand [[Spiritual practices and growth | spiritually]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. As one's influence grows, it's crucial not to miss the [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth_and_societal_evolution | spiritual part]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.

Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is a crucial hormone that plays a significant role in improving metabolism, building lean muscle, and burning fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Intermittent Fasting (IF) is a dietary approach that emphasizes meal timings to influence the body's hormonal system, particularly HGH levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## HGH Levels Across Age Groups

HGH levels are naturally very high in young adults and individuals in their late teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Males typically grow until around 21 years old, and females until about 18 years old, during which their HGH levels remain elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This explains why younger individuals can often consume more junk food without significant weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. As people age, HGH levels gradually decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, which can lead to a slower metabolism and make fitness goals harder to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Impact of Intermittent Fasting on HGH

Under normal circumstances, HGH is secreted into the bloodstream primarily at night while sleeping, typically in two spurts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Meals, however, suppress the release of HGH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Intermittent Fasting aims to increase the body's HGH levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. By creating a fasting period—often 16 hours where only water, black coffee, or unsweetened green tea are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>—the body is "fooled" into a state resembling potential starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. While actual starvation is defined as four days without food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, this shock prompts the body to increase HGH levels to cope with the perceived lack of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Studies indicate that the longer one fasts, the more HGH is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While HGH release can occur after a 12-hour fast, a 16-hour fast is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Some studies have even shown a 250% increase in HGH levels after a 36-hour fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## Functions of HGH

HGH performs several vital functions in the body:
*   **Muscle and Bone Growth** In younger individuals, HGH significantly aids in the growth of muscles and bones, contributing to [[teenage_fitness_and_height_growth | height growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **[[effects_of_weight_training_on_muscle_recovery | Muscle Recovery]] and Repair** For adults who have reached their full height potential (typically over 21 years old), HGH primarily assists in [[effects_of_weight_training_on_muscle_recovery | muscle recovery]] and repair from daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Fat Mobilization** HGH is crucial for fat mobilization, which is the body's process of burning fat for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Higher HGH levels make it easier to burn off fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Protein Sparing** HGH acts as a "protein sparer," signaling the body to preserve muscle mass and prioritize burning fat when food is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The more HGH present, the better the body can save muscle while burning fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Higher HGH Levels

Higher levels of HGH, encouraged by practices like intermittent fasting, make it significantly easier to both build muscle mass and burn fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This hormonal regulation contributes to improving overall body composition and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

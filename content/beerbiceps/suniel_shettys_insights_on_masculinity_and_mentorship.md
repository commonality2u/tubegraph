Suniel Shetty's appearance on AIO Presents "The Ranveer Show" was framed by the host as an episode focused on "mentors and positive masculinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, offering "masculine lessons" valuable to both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The conversation delves into personal growth, fatherhood, relationships, and the importance of guidance through life's stages.

## The Importance of Mentors and Guidance

For Suniel Shetty, the concept of a mentor, or "Guru," is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He emphasizes seeking guidance from those with profound wisdom, like his martial arts Sensei P.S. Mystery, rather than just "trainers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He believes in the deep-rooted Indian cultural value of Guru-disciple relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

He highlights the need for younger generations, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, to have mentors as they enter their 20s and 30s to "lubricate their entire process" in career and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Masculinity and Emotional Health

Suniel Shetty addresses common narratives around men's mental health. He rejects the idea that a man is only loved if he can do something for others, viewing this as a "glass always half empty" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. He advocates for giving without expectation, stating that "from what you get you make a living, from what you give you can make a life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This includes giving time, listening to others when they're upset, and simple phone calls to check in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

He believes that a strong family background, particularly a supportive marriage and family life, significantly benefits one's mental health and, by extension, career and overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Fatherhood and Relationships

Suniel Shetty shares insights on the father-child dynamic and personal relationships:

*   **Connecting with Fathers**: He acknowledges that it's often difficult for fathers to change or express themselves due to their own stresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. He encourages sons to initiate conversations with their dads, to "walk up to dad and say, 'you know, I want to sit, I want to chat. Don't expect anything from him, just pour your heart out to him and it'll work'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing a Partner**: He stresses that the choice of a partner "matters a hell of a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. A supportive partner can enable one to "go on to fifth gear" in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. He attributes his own success and well-being to his wife, who provided stability and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Marriage and Family**: He advises getting married and settling down at the right age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. His decision to marry early in his career, despite warnings from the industry, was "the most beautiful decision" he took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. He believes in respecting and trusting one's partner and allowing them independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Family**: Suniel Shetty makes family time a priority, never working on Sundays. He learned this lesson from Danny Denzongpa, emphasizing the importance of "me time" and family time away from distractions like phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Ageing

Suniel Shetty reflects on his personal journey and outlook on ageing:

*   **Reinvention**: At 60, he is "relooking at myself, reinventing myself" and approaching work with a desire to "enjoy and make it meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Age as a Number**: He believes that "age is just a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a> and focuses on health and wellness as a "consistent factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. His goal is to inspire younger generations by demonstrating that a fit, healthy lifestyle is achievable at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Wisdom Over Speed**: While acknowledging that an "action hero" might "slow down" with age, he sees the best aspect of growing older as becoming "smarter" and "wiser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This wisdom allows him to "shoot things better" and "present things better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Life's Stages**: He views "every stage is beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, from bachelorhood and dating to finding a partner, having children, and eventually grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

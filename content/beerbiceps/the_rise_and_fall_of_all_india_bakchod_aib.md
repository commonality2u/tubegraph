All India Bakchod (AIB), a prominent media company in the Indian internet landscape, was once considered the top media company in its domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. AIB began in early 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This article explores its journey, challenges, and the lessons learned by its co-founder, Tanmay Bhat.

## The Disintegration of AIB
The period leading to AIB's disintegration involved several "dark topics" that Tanmay Bhat had not discussed in other interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Key moments that marked its decline include:
*   **The Sachin-Laxman Controversy** The controversy surrounding the Sachin-Laxman issue caused significant stress for Bhat's parents, who urged him to quit comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This incident followed the "roast" that had happened just a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Employee Layoffs** Bhat described letting go of all AIB employees as a "pretty terrible" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He broke down in front of the entire office while explaining that there was nothing else they could do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This event led him to question his entire life, having spent a decade building the company and working with its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. He lacked an office to go to and spent a period of one to two months feeling lost, eating and sleeping on a couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Financial Challenges
AIB was not a funded company, relying on reinvesting money that came in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Overnight, the company lost all brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Debt** AIB found itself in severe debt, owing a lot of people money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Projects, such as the movie "Chintu" and a show for Amazon, had incurred production costs but couldn't be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The company only had enough money to operate until November end of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Support Amidst Crisis** Despite the financial difficulties, those to whom AIB owed money expressed trust, believing the company would recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## AIB's Legacy and Tanmay Bhat's Evolution
In hindsight, Bhat views the mass layoffs as a moment that allowed former employees to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Employee Success** Many former AIB employees secured higher-paying jobs, founded new companies, and are "killing it" in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The AIB social media team, for instance, started their own company called "One Hand Clap," in which Bhat has since invested. This company now manages AIB's social media and also helped repay a portion of AIB's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **AIB as an Institution** Bhat's goal was for AIB to be an "institution" in comedy, where anyone who worked there gained a valuable experience akin to earning another degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Projects** While the AIB YouTube channel is inactive, other projects are in motion, including the movie "Chintu" and an Amazon show. Additionally, a movie from First Draft is going into production in February, and Bhat is working on two movies presented by AIB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The co-founders, Ashish, Rohan, and Gursimran, are all in touch and pursuing their own projects, including comedy specials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Personal Reinvention and Lessons Learned
The challenging period led to a significant personal reinvention for Tanmay Bhat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Self-Worth Beyond Work** He realized his self-worth was not solely defined by his work, and that he was still a person even without an office to go to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This understanding made the darkest period also the "most enlightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Leadership Insights** Bhat reflected that he would have hired a CEO focused on running the company, acknowledging that as an artist, his judgment was often impaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. He also recognized his insecurity as a leader, which manifested in ways that might not have been ideal for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. He believes that insecure managers often compensate through cruelty, whereas secure bosses are more effective leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Perception of News and People** Bhat emphasized that news often prioritizes "views" over "truth," which is more complicated and nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. He advises against judging people based on news, stating that "everybody's gray" and that those who are least accepting of others' flaws are often unaware of their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   **Life Philosophy** He learned that life is "incredibly long" and that one should "play long-term games" rather than rushing for immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Recruitment Philosophy** When hiring, Bhat now looks for "brokenness" as an indicator of drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. He prefers "lazy geniuses" who have fantastic ideas and find the quickest way to achieve goals, rather than just hard workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. He also seeks candidates who exhibit "radical thinking" and are "Fearless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. A deal-breaker for him is a refusal to learn or "close-mindedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Mentorship and Growth** Bhat considers the host of [[growth_and_impact_of_the_ranveer_show_in_india | The Ranveer Show]] to be his first mentor in the media industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He received business advice from the host, who he initially helped with weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Conversely, he provided media industry guidance to the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This journey, from the peak of AIB's success to its subsequent challenges, has been a significant learning experience for Tanmay Bhat, fostering self-awareness and a new perspective on life and business.

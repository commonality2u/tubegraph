Professional bodybuilding is widely considered "probably the hardest sport in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, demanding immense physical and mental fortitude. Eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, [[ronnie_colemans_journey_to_mr_olympia | Ronnie Coleman]], shares his experiences on the dedication, sacrifices, and mindset required to reach the pinnacle of the sport, as well as the unique rewards and challenges that come with it.

## The Demands of Being a Champion

### Unwavering Commitment
Being a professional bodybuilder, especially a multiple-time champion, is a "24/7 what 365 they job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Athletes cannot "slip up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> because competitors are constantly working hard to take their title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This requires an unparalleled level of [[training_intensity_and_mental_focus_in_bodybuilding | commitment]], dedication, and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Extreme Dietary Requirements
To gain the necessary size, bodybuilders must eat a huge amount of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. Coleman's diet included six meals a day, with a pound of chicken in every meal, and he would even wake up in the middle of the night to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. He had to eat regardless of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>, stuffing himself until his body adjusted to the massive intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. His nutritionist advised him to increase his food intake from 10 ounces to 16 ounces per meal to achieve championship size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. At his peak, he consumed 600 grams of protein daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

Coleman notes that red meat contributed significantly to his unique muscle thickness and density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. He believes it is difficult to achieve his level of thickness with only chicken and fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.

### Sacrifice of Social Life
The intense preparation for competitions meant a limited social life. Coleman couldn't go out to eat, go to the movies, attend parties, or even weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. "Everything was about bodybuilding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. These "real real dark times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> were essential to staying committed to his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Rigorous Training and Mindset
Coleman's technical edge came from his extraordinary training volume and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. He performed feats like squatting 800 lbs, deadlifting 800 lbs, and leg pressing 2300 lbs for reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, actions he believes other bodybuilders wouldn't or couldn't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This heavy lifting, rooted in his powerlifting background since age 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, contributed to his muscle thickness, definition, and density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

His [[training_intensity_and_mental_focus_in_bodybuilding | mental approach]] was crucial. He cultivated an "attitude" in the gym, telling himself, "if they want to go to war, take them to war and they they ain't going to take this away from me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Visualization was key; he would picture successful lifts, like squatting 800 lbs, for weeks before attempting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. He believes he had "just about everything at [his] disposal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> to win eight Mr. Olympias.

Coleman also prioritized flexibility, stretching for 20-30 minutes every night, a habit carried over from his football days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. This allowed him to remain flexible even at 330 lbs, performing splits on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

### Navigating Steroid Use
Coleman began using steroids at 30 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, after gaining information from fellow bodybuilder Flex Wheeler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. He emphasized that his use was always doctor-prescribed, with check-ups every four months to monitor his liver, kidneys, and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. He never experienced health problems due to this supervised approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. He believes many people misuse steroids due to a "lust for that kind of a body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a> without understanding the necessary precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.

During competition prep, Coleman significantly reduced his sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>, focusing solely on winning.

## The Rewards and Mindset of a Champion

### The Thrill of Victory
Winning his first Olympia was "the most amazing thing that will ever happen" to Coleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. He blacked out from the overwhelming excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. Despite not initially getting into bodybuilding to win the Olympia, but rather for a free gym membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:4:30">[00:4:30]</a>, achieving the highest title was a profound experience.

### Overcoming Adversity and Finding Joy
Coleman often felt overlooked early in his career because he didn't have the same "fan fare" as other pros who turned pro in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, having turned pro in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Despite this, he did not dwell on loneliness because his family was always close by and supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. His mom cooked all his meals, and his siblings helped with fan mail, chores, and car maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Their support was integral to his eight consecutive wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Coleman attributes his positive outlook to his strong faith, believing "things happen for a reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Even when faced with tragic experiences as a police officer, such as murders and domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, he rationalized them as part of life's cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This perspective fosters humility and prevents arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

Coleman feels like "one of the luckiest guys in the whole wide world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a> because of the unique gift he received from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>, giving him reason to be "extremely happy for the rest of [his] life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Post-Career Life and Advice

### Accepting Aging and New Joys
After his competitive career, Coleman finds himself finally "getting the The thrill of the enjoyment of winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He reflects on his past physique with amazement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, admitting he felt "invincible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> at his peak.

While he dislikes aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>, he accepts it as a "good thing because you know you're still alive and you still functioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. The gifts of aging include relaxation, freedom from intense training, and enjoying activities previously sacrificed, like going to movies, restaurants, and parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. Most importantly, it allows for more family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Bodybuilders
Coleman's primary advice for young bodybuilders is to seek "knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. He recommends learning from knowledgeable coaches and continuously seeking out more experienced mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>, stating, "you shouldn't just have one coach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. This includes understanding diet, training, and recovery â€” "everything it takes to be a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy
Coleman asserts that happiness is a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. Even when delivering pizzas despite a college degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>, he found ways to be happy and joyous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. His mother taught him to pursue desires "joyfully" and "with some passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. This unwavering positive attitude is a hallmark of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. He believes God gives everyone a gift, and it's up to each person to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.

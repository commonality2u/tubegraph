Some individuals work diligently without achieving success, while others find success comes easily. This difference is not due to unfairness but to "visible karma" in the current life and "good karmas" performed by the soul in previous "costumes" or lifetimes, which are not currently visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Impact of Meditation on Sleep
The amount of [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]] required can reduce as one deepens their [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>. This is because [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]] is primarily needed to energize both the body and the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. In modern lifestyles, physical fatigue is less common due to comfortable environments like AC homes and offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>. Instead, most people experience emotional fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>.

If the mind generates a lot of "lower vibrational energy" throughout the day, such as stress, anger, critical or judgmental thoughts, hurt, or feeling let down, the mind becomes tired and fatigued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:05">[03:52:05]</a>. The quality of thoughts during the day directly affects the quality of thoughts during [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:16">[04:14:16]</a>. This mental disturbance makes it difficult to fall asleep easily and reach the deep "Delta stage" of [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:08">[04:23:08]</a>. Instead, individuals may remain in "beta plus" (thinking), "beta," or "alpha" (dream) stages, often waking up in the middle of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>. Even after longer hours of [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]], the mind can remain tired if it was active with turbulent emotions or consumed unsoothing media before bedtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:35">[05:19:35]</a>.

*Meditation's role:* [[Meditation and its effects on mental health|Meditation]] helps by reducing mental clutter and emotional fatigue, leading to a deeper and more restful [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:02">[03:15:02]</a>.

## Meditation and Consciousness Expansion
Spiritual conversations and [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] are noted as ways to expand one's consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The speaker's mother began practicing [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]], leading to a shift in the household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. Initially, the speaker didn't feel the need for [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] as life felt "fine" 25 years ago, a time when the word "stress" was not commonly used in relation to human emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. However, the speaker eventually decided to learn it without any specific external reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

The inclination towards a meditative living is not about age but the "intention of the Soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:05">[07:55:05]</a>. We are currently in a "paradigm shift," a "transition" period where some are in "deep [[The importance of sleep and its effects on the brain|sleep]]" while others are experiencing an "Awakening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:13">[08:28:13]</a>. Starting [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] means raising one's vibration from lower frequencies (stress, anger) to higher states (calm, stability, acceptance, forgiveness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:07">[10:53:07]</a>.

When one's vibration is raised, it radiates energy into the collective consciousness of the planet, causing the planet's energy to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:39">[11:10:39]</a>. A "Tipping Point" – a small number of people raising their vibration – can overpower lower vibrational energy and shift the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:03">[11:36:03]</a>.

## Spiritual Progress and Stamina
Gauging progress in a [[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life|meditation journey]] is not solely about specific [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] experiences, which can vary daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:35">[21:39:35]</a>. Spiritual progress is determined by how one's feelings change "while in activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:17">[22:49:17]</a>. This means becoming a "Karam Yogi," doing one's actions in a meditative way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. The stillness and divinity experienced during [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] should extend into daily life, even during crises or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:17">[22:30:17]</a>.

This is akin to building "spiritual stamina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:08">[23:27:08]</a>. For example, if one previously reacted with anger, spiritual progress means reactions become less intense, eventually leading to a calm response rather than a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>. If [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] doesn't translate into spiritual stamina, it's time to re-evaluate the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:09">[23:48:09]</a>.

[[Importance of Meditation|Meditation]] also helps in changing "sanskars," which are emotional patterns or the "nature" of the soul, like criticism, appreciation, doubt, or trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:09">[17:50:09]</a>. These sanskars are carried from past karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:07">[18:19:07]</a>. Changing one's sanskars helps face the consequences of past karma without suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:49">[19:56:49]</a>. By energizing oneself through [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]], one can respond differently to life's scenes, creating a "bulletproof costume" that allows one to accept and forgive, rather than react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:48">[16:47:48]</a>.

### Astrology and Karma
Astrological charts are based on the karma and sanskars a soul carries from previous lifetimes, serving as an "opening balance sheet" for the current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:35">[27:12:35]</a>. This is why a destiny chart can be prepared for a newborn who has not yet performed any karma in the current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:13">[26:28:13]</a>. Astrology is the science of planetary influences on one's sanskars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>.

[[Importance of Meditation|Meditation]] can "melt" or change one's sanskars for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. If sanskars change due to [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] or other influences, the influence of the planets will also change, rendering some astrological predictions untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:17">[29:30:17]</a>. The astrological chart is merely a "probability manual," not a "reality manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:37">[30:37:37]</a>. Individuals create their own reality by choosing to change their lifestyle and karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:13">[31:36:13]</a>.

## Purpose of Life and Spiritual Living
[[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life|Spirituality]] is not a separate life but "the way to be in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15:37">[35:15:37]</a>. One continues their roles and responsibilities—whether in relationships or work—but with a different "frame of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:05">[35:25:05]</a>. The aim is to integrate [[Importance of Meditation|meditation]] into daily actions, making it a "Karam Yogi" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:16">[35:46:16]</a>. This means acting "with happiness," not "for happiness," radiating positive energy rather than extracting it from the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:16">[36:39:16]</a>.

### Karmic Accounts and Relationships
Every person encountered in a close energy circle (friends, parents, siblings, romantic partners) has been met before across different lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. Present relationships are influenced by past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:19">[38:54:19]</a>. Karmic accounts can either become more bitter or be resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:15">[40:19:15]</a>. [[Importance of Meditation|Meditation]] helps overcome ego and be the first to do the right karma in a relationship, even if the other person doesn't reciprocate immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:01">[42:20:01]</a>. This builds spiritual stamina, allowing one to radiate good energy despite not receiving it, thereby settling past karmic accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:30">[42:36:30]</a>.

Marriage, like other life choices, is determined by individual sanskars and karmic patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:04">[44:16:04]</a>. Even if a divorce is predicted in a destiny chart, individuals can change their "present Karma" to alter that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>.

### Symbolic Meaning in Ancient Teachings
Ancient practices and substances mentioned in scriptures, like "somas" or "bhang," are symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:04:19">[48:04:19]</a>. For instance, the intoxication associated with bhang on Shivratri symbolizes the "spiritual intoxication" felt from connecting to the Divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:04">[48:47:04]</a>. Festivals like Ganesh Chaturti, Navratri, Dussehra, and Diwali also hold deeper spiritual meanings beyond physical rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:19">[49:00:19]</a>:
*   **Ganesh Chaturti:** Symbolizes destroying obstacles and radiating happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46:00">[49:46:00]</a>.
*   **Navratri:** Represents the eight powers of the soul (e.g., withdrawal, discernment, adjustment, cooperation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:57">[50:30:57]</a>.
*   **Dussehra:** Symbolizes conquering the ten vices (lust, greed, jealousy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:09">[50:56:09]</a>.
*   **Diwali:** Represents lighting the inner "dia" (lamp), symbolizing being a giver and having the power to uplift others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:47">[51:09:47]</a>.

Similarly, the concept of "divine feminine" or "Mata" is not about gender but "soul power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>, referred to as Shiv (Supreme Soul) and Shakti (soul's power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Ancestors were teaching about the "dham" (religion/quality) of the soul, which includes purity, peace, love, power, wisdom, and bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

### The Soul's Journey and the World Cycle
The human population is increasing because souls are continually coming from the "soul world," a realm beyond the physical universe that science cannot yet comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This is the "home" that souls vaguely remember and wish to return to for "moksha" or "mukti" (liberation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

The world operates in a cycle of Golden Age, Silver Age, Copper Age, and Iron Age (Satyug, Treta Yug, Dwapar Yug, Kalyug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:14">[09:08:14]</a>. We are currently at the "peak of Iron Age," transitioning towards the Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:15">[09:22:15]</a>. This cycle involves the soul's "battery" gradually depleting its original divine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:56">[09:56:56]</a>. As vibrations lower, ego, lust, greed, jealousy, hurt, and [[Meditation and its effects on mental health|mental health]] issues increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:26">[10:14:26]</a>.

The universe and planets serve as a reminder to "look up and go beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, recognizing that life extends far beyond what is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. Humanity has forgotten its source, identity, purpose, and divine parent, leading to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. Religious teachers throughout history came to teach us to return to our true nature and potential, emphasizing unity and the core qualities of the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

The current period is a time of "upheaval" and "Awakening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>, where the "old house [is] crumbling and the new house [is] under construction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. Each individual's effort to change their sanskars and raise their vibration contributes to the planet's shift and the construction of this "new house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. By shifting personally, individuals become part of the "Tipping Point" population instrumental in changing the "night into the morning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

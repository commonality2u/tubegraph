The pursuit of "fair" skin is a concept rooted in imperialism, where European countries historically promoted the idea that white skin was superior [01:00:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This ideology has unfortunately persisted, influencing perceptions through advertisements that suggest fair skin is necessary for career success or finding love [00:41:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to remember that skin color is genetic and should not be altered [01:14:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on making one's natural skin the best version of itself [01:19:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Skincare Fundamentals

### Avoiding Skin Whitening Products
It is advised against chasing skin whitening and using skin whitening creams because they can harm the face in the long term [01:27:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. These creams often contain harmful substances such as hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil the quality of your skin [01:33:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Skincare Routines for Different Skin Types
[[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | Achieving healthy, glowing skin]] depends on addressing specific skin concerns, such as dryness or oiliness. These are key components of a [[face_washing_routine_and_products | face washing routine and products]].

#### For Dry Skin
If you have dry skin, a mild moisturizer is essential [01:54:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. After washing your face and drying it with a towel, immediately apply a moisturizer [01:48:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Moisturizers are beneficial for skin that flakes or for dry lips; petroleum jelly (Vaseline) can also be used [02:01:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Regular use helps achieve glowing, healthy skin in the long term [02:10:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

#### For Oily Skin
For those with oily skin, a home remedy using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth) can be beneficial as part of a [[basic_skincare_routine_for_oily_skin | basic skincare routine for oily skin]] [02:18:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** Chip off a piece of Fuller's Earth and pound it into a powder [02:27:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric and a squeeze of lemon to create a paste, adding a few drops of water if needed for a smooth consistency [02:32:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry, but do not keep it on for more than 20 minutes before washing it off [02:45:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Turmeric acts as an antiseptic, cleaning the face [02:54:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Lemon helps increase skin glow [02:58:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Fuller's Earth effectively absorbs excess oil from the face [03:02:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Use this mixture no more than once or twice a week (e.g., every 3 days) to prevent the skin from secreting even more oil in response to overuse [03:08:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Visible changes can often be seen within a month [03:20:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Exfoliation
To achieve glowing, "baby-type" skin, exfoliation using a face scrub is recommended [03:23:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Method:** A face scrub is a face wash containing small hard particles [03:29:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. When applying, massage your face firmly in a circular motion, ensuring a slight tingling feeling [03:33:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** The hard particles increase blood circulation to the face, which promotes skin growth and contributes to glowing skin [03:47:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Caution:** Do not use exfoliation if you are very acne-prone or have active acne, as it can harm inflammations [04:00:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** For healthy, glowing skin, exfoliate no more than once a week, possibly on the same day as the Multani Mitti application [04:12:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## [[diet_and_lifestyle_factors_affecting_skin_health | Diet and Lifestyle Factors Affecting Skin Health]]
[[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | Clear and glowing skin]] is significantly influenced by diet.
*   **Hydration:** Staying hydrated throughout the day is critical; aim for clear urine for most of the day [04:27:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. If urine is slightly yellow, drink more water [04:34:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Focus primarily on vegetables, which are more nutritionally dense than fruits, providing more vitamins and minerals for the same amount of food [04:37:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Incorporating a variety of colorful vegetables is a quick way to achieve healthy skin [04:52:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Importance of Self-Acceptance
Beyond specific skincare and [[grooming_tips_for_different_skin_types | grooming tips for different skin types]], the most important advice is to love yourself and be comfortable in your own skin [08:33:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Attractiveness is significantly influenced by positivity and confidence [08:22:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. It's vital to reject the belief that fair skin is superior to dark skin, as all skin types are considered beautiful today [08:41:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Promoting ideas that encourage changing natural skin color or getting rid of suntan is akin to promoting racism [09:00:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

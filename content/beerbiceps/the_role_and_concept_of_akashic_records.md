The [[the_metaphysical_understanding_of_karma_and_reincarnation | Akashic Records]] are understood as the sum totality of all a soul's experiences, essentially a "book of records" spanning every lifetime a soul has lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. On average, individuals living today are believed to have experienced between 50 to 500 lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. These records store the complete journey of a soul, including details about past partners, parents, children, and the virtues or weaknesses developed over each lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. This extensive data is stored in an energetic record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

## Energetic Blueprint and Purpose
Before incarnating into human form, a soul evaluates its past and future to create a master plan, or "energetic blueprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This blueprint guides the soul on its journey, outlining the specific lessons it needs to learn, the individuals it needs to interact with to complete past life connections, and the new experiences necessary to attain a higher vibrational frequency or [[the_role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth_and_societal_evolution | ascension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. The [[The role of spirituality and manifestation in personal success | Akashic Record]] serves as this life plan, detailing the people to meet, and the highs and lows to experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

## Components of Akashic Records
The Akashic Record can be simplified into three main components:

### Karmic Contracts
These are symbiotic relationships individuals enter, including those with parents, partners, colleagues, teachers, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. These contracts are often "eternal" and never-ending, where each person contributes something to the other's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. Even if disconnected for a period, individuals under a karmic contract may cross paths again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. The universe ensures that whenever a specific need arises, the karmic contract brings the necessary energy or person into one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

### Karmic Lessons
Karmic lessons involve short-lived relationships or situations whose primary purpose is to teach an individual a specific lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. If a lesson is not learned, the universe will present another person or situation, often in a "harsher way," until the lesson is absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Repeated patterns, such as continually attracting abusive partners or toxic bosses, are indicators of unlearned karmic lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. Once the lesson is truly learned, that specific type of person or energy will no longer appear in one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

### Karmic Incompletions
These refer to tasks or experiences left unfinished in previous lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. The soul may choose to complete these in its current incarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. While suffering is often attributed to past life actions, new contracts and projects are also undertaken in each lifetime, facilitating the soul's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

[[Karma and understanding karmic lessons | Karma]] itself cannot be changed, only balanced or released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.
*   **Balancing Karma:** Occurs by experiencing what was done in the past, often with the same individuals involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
*   **Releasing Karma:** Involves an energy exchange where balance is achieved, but not necessarily with the same people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>. For example, if one cheated someone out of money in a past life, they might lose money, and someone else might find that exact amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>.

## Accessing Akashic Records
A psychic can access and interpret these records by tapping into karmic and akashic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The ability to access these records provides insight into a soul's past, present, and future journey, including lessons needed, purpose, and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This enables psychic readings to reveal why individuals attract certain situations (whether karmic or self-created) and how to develop mental and emotional immunity to handle life's challenges more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

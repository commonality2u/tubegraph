The period following the [[Krishna in the Mahabharata | Mahabharata]] war, approximately 36 years, is a significant part of [[Krishna | Krishna's]] life that is less frequently discussed [02:00:58]. Details of this period are primarily mentioned in the Mahabharatam itself [01:03:03] and also in the Bhagavat Puranam [02:11:58].

## Gandhari's Curse
Towards the end of the 18-day Mahabharata war, the entire Kuru dynasty is devastated, with all one hundred Kaurava brothers killed and their wives widowed [02:03:21]. The battlefield is a gruesome sight, filled with blood and bodies being preyed upon by vultures [02:03:40]. Gandhari, the mother of the Kauravas, arrives on the battlefield. Despite being blindfolded, she senses the immense grief around her and feels her sons' bodies [02:03:50]. Overwhelmed by sorrow, she momentarily forgets that her sons initiated the adharmic actions that led to this destruction [02:05:07].

Turning towards [[Krishna | Krishna]], who is behind her, Gandhari accuses him of causing her profound loss and heart-wrenching pain [02:05:28]. She then curses [[Krishna | Krishna]], declaring that he will die silently and without respect, by a hunter's arrow [02:05:44]. Unlike the warriors who died on the battlefield and would attain higher realms by fulfilling their duty, Gandhari prophesies an ignoble end for [[Krishna | Krishna]] [02:05:59].

[[Krishna | Krishna]] accepts this curse with a smile [02:06:07]. He reveals that he would have chosen to depart in that manner anyway, implying that Gandhari "wasted her Tapas" (spiritual penance) on a predetermined event [02:06:11]. Gandhari had accumulated immense Tapas by choosing to blindfold herself, sharing her blind husband Dhritarashtra's fate [02:06:30]. This Tapas had granted her "Vak Sidhi," the power for her words to come true [02:07:03]. [[Krishna | Krishna's]] lesson here emphasizes that one should not waste their spiritual accumulation by wishing ill upon others, as karmic consequences will unfold regardless [02:07:27].

## End of the Yadu Dynasty and Krishna's Departure
After the war, [[Krishna | Krishna]] goes to Dwaraka, the city he established in Gujarat [01:31:56], [02:07:50]. There, he witnesses the gradual destruction of his own clan, the Yadu vamsh [02:07:50]. This internecine bickering and self-destruction among the Yadus is said to be an extension of Gandhari's curse, as well as their own karmic destiny [02:08:04]. [[Krishna | Krishna]] calmly observes these events unfold, seeing each being meet their final point [02:09:35].

Finally, [[Krishna | Krishna]] retires to a forest near Dwaraka, which is still visible today [02:08:19]. He sits at the base of a tree, with one of his lotus feet, which sustains the entire universe, outstretched [02:08:27]. A hunter, mistaking [[Krishna's]] dark foot for a deer's ear, shoots a poisoned arrow at it [02:08:44]. The poisoned arrow strikes the tip of [[Krishna's]] foot, and as the poison spreads, [[Krishna | Krishna]] returns to "Shashwat Goloka," his eternal abode [02:08:56].

Prior to his own departure, [[Krishna | Krishna]] instructs his elder brother, Balarama, to return to his divine form [02:09:04]. Balarama, who is an incarnation of Adishesha, the serpent on whom [[Vishnu and His Avatars | Vishnu]] reclines, transforms into a white snake and slithers into the ocean [02:09:12]. This ensures that "the bed is ready before the Lord comes back to recline" [02:09:24].

## Fulfillment of Divine Purpose
[[Krishna's]] avataram, the final [[Vishnu and His Avatars | avatar]] in this cycle, is seen as a means to grant liberation [01:46:53]. According to the narrative, "nobody who comes in contact with [[Krishna | Krishna]] comes back into samsara chakra" [01:46:58]. This is the profound secret of [[Krishna | Krishna]] upasana (worship) [01:47:02].

[[Krishna's]] life, including his final days, symbolizes the fulfillment of his divine purpose [02:09:43]. This included blessing the Gopi janas (devotees) who had awaited him for lifetimes [02:09:51], releasing Jaya and Vijaya from their curses through the killing of rakshasas like Shishupala and Dantavakra [02:10:01], and initiating the Mahabharata war to cleanse the Earth of adharmic kings [01:48:02]. Through the [[Bhagavad Gita and life lessons | Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna | Krishna]] provided timeless wisdom, serving as the "universe's conscience keeper" [01:55:35], [02:10:10]. He declared that those who dedicate themselves completely to him would be under his constant care, without a second's break [01:59:00]. Having achieved all this, [[Krishna | Krishna]] peacefully departs, leaving behind his profound teachings and the assurance of liberation for those connected to him [02:10:18].

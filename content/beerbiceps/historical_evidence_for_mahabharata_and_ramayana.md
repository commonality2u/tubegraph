Nīleśh Oak, an engineer and modern-day historian, approaches the study of [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Indian epics]] with a scientific and evidence-based mindset, prioritizing proof and research over traditional academic views that might dismiss ancient texts. His work focuses on corroborating details from the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] and [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] with [[Archaeological and celestial evidence | archaeological and celestial evidence]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:45">[03:22:45]</a>

## Dating the Epics
Based on his research, Oak proposes specific dating for the major [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Indian epics]]:
*   The [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] occurred over 7,000 years ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:42">[06:57:42]</a> Specifically, it is dated to 5561 BCE. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:08">[07:13:08]</a>
*   The [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] happened over 14,000 years ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:19">[07:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a> The specific date given is 12,209 BCE. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:14">[07:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>
*   The Rigveda dates back more than 21,000 years ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:44">[07:02:44]</a>

This suggests a "multiplication of seven" pattern in their chronology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:44">[07:05:44]</a>

## The Concept of Yugas
The term "Yuga" in the [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Indian context]] simply means a "period of time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:10">[08:34:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:40">[08:38:40]</a> There are over 26 different definitions of a Yuga. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>

Different interpretations of Yuga include:
*   **Based on Action:** A Brahman text connected to the Rigveda defines Yugas based on one's state of action:
    *   Kalyuga: When sleeping. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:03">[10:16:03]</a>
    *   Dwapar: When waking up and sitting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:30">[10:20:30]</a>
    *   Treta: When standing up. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:39">[10:24:39]</a>
    *   Satyuga: When in action and walking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:09">[10:26:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a> This interpretation emphasizes action over chronological time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:46">[10:39:46]</a>
*   **Emotional State:** Similar to Einstein's theory of relativity, a Yuga can be perceived as an emotional state. The saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu described a blink of an eye feeling like a Yuga when separated from Govinda. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:11">[11:46:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:40">[12:02:40]</a>
*   **Astronomical Formulations:** The well-known durations of Yugas (e.g., 432,000 years for Kaliyuga) relate to mathematical computations in [[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | astronomy]] for precise orbital periods of planets, not chronological durations of historical periods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:44">[12:28:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>
*   **Calendrical Yuga:** A five-year Yuga used in calendrical systems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:16">[12:59:16]</a>

The [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] also describes "Kalachakra" (the wheel of time), stating that the type of Yuga is determined by how a king or administrator governs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:30">[13:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>

## Rakshasas and Asuras
The terms "Rakshasas" and "Asuras" in [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Indian epics]] are reinterpreted to reflect human beings or groups with distinct characteristics, rather than purely mythical creatures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:59">[21:19:59]</a>

*   **Asuras:** In the Rigveda, "Asura" was initially a term of praise, with deities like Indra and Varuna being called Asura. Over time, its meaning shifted to denote something negative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:37">[19:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:30">[19:51:30]</a> The connection between Indian and Persian (Zoroastrian) cultures is highlighted, where "Deva" is villainous in Zoroastrianism and "Asura" is noble, while in [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Hinduism]], "Asura" is villainous and "Deva" is noble. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a> This suggests two warring tribes where each depicted the other as villainous. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>
*   **Rakshasas:** The Sanskrit root of "Rakshasa" is "Raksham," meaning "one who protects." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a> However, as with power corrupting, these protectors might have become formidable figures, even enemies, over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a> Raavana, though a Rakshasa, was a descendant of a great sage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>
*   **Hidimba and Bakasura:** These figures from the [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] are posited as powerful human beings, perhaps from different regions like Africa, who were perceived as distinct. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a> Raavana's extensive kingdom, reaching South America and controlling parts of India, explains inter-transnational marriages and relationships with various powerful human groups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>
*   **Lifespans:** The epics describe longer lifespans for individuals like Bhishma (140+ years old during the [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] war) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. This is explained by concepts like Kriya Yoga, which can extend biological life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>

## South America Connection in [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Indian Epics]]
The concept of "Patal Loka" is identified as South America. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>

*   **King Bali and Virochana:** The Puranas, including Bhagwat Purana, describe King Bali being "house-arrested" in what is possibly modern-day Bali, Indonesia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a> Later, Bali goes to Patal and establishes colonies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a> South American folklore, particularly among the Incas, speaks of a civilizing figure named "Virocha" (possibly Virochana, Bali's ancestor) who came from across the ocean. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>
*   **Aztecs and Nagas:** The Aztecs in Mexico are connected to the Sanskrit word "Asik" (sages). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a> The sage Astika is associated with the Nagas (human beings mentioned in [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]]). This suggests that Nagas might have migrated with Bali to South America, explaining the snake symbolism found there. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>
*   **Sugriva's Atlas:** The [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] provides detailed geographical descriptions, particularly in Sugriva's instructions to the Vanara parties searching for Sita. Sugriva's knowledge spans from the Andes to the Alps and from the Arctic Sea to Antarctica. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>
    *   **East Direction (South America):** Sugriva describes a journey eastward from India, through Thailand (land of silver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a> and Java (Yava Dweepa, land of Yava grains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>, across the Pacific Ocean. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a> He then details a land marked by a golden, pillar-like trident (Trishool) on a mountain, referred to as the insignia of Lord Ananta. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a> This corresponds perfectly to the "Candelabra of Andes" in Peru, an 800-foot-tall trident geoglyph near the Bay of Paracas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a> Locals do not know its origin, but the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] states it was established by Indra in a past Yuga (before the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]]) to mark the end of the East direction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a> Furthermore, there is a Mount Ananta in the Andes, and local names for mountains are found to be native languages, not Spanish. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>
    *   **Vampire Bats:** The [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] describes horrifying "Mandas" (demons) of various shapes, "dangling upside down from mountain peaks." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a> This is interpreted as a description of vampire bats, which are endemic to South America. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>
    *   **North Direction:** Sugriva describes lands beyond the Himalayas (Kailash area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>, including the "land of many rivers" (western China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a> known as Uttara Kuru and Uttara Madra. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20:00">[47:20:00]</a> He warns against going further north due to the Arctic Sea and ice age conditions (Permafrost and Tundra), <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a> and mentions the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) as a beautiful bright phenomenon in the dark land. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:00">[48:35:00]</a>
    *   **South Direction:** Sugriva describes lands all the way to Antarctica, which was "discovered" by Europeans only in the 18th century. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:02:00]</a> Maps from the 15th century by individuals like Piri Reis, based on ancient Indian and Arab maps, already showed Antarctica with accurate landmasses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>
    *   **West Direction:** Sugriva describes a route from India through Saurashtra, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Romania, with a chain of mountains leading up to the Alps (called "Aairi" in the text). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:49:00">[51:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:24:00">[52:24:00]</a>

## Catastrophic Sea Level Rise Events
[[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | Geological data]] reveals periods of catastrophic sea-level rise, corroborating ancient texts about submerged cities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a> These are natural events driven by global warming cycles, but interrupted by sudden "catastrophic rise events" (CREs) where large ice blocks break off, leading to rapid sea-level changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>

*   **[[Krishna in the Mahabharat and its historical dating | Krishna's Dwarka]]:** The [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] states that [[Krishna in the Mahabharat and its historical dating | Krishna's Dwarka]] was submerged by gushing sea waters 36 years after the [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a> Given the [[The Mahabharata and Krishnas involvement | Mahabharata]] date of 5561 BCE, this places Dwarka's destruction around 5525 BCE. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>
    *   Geological data from the Arabian Sea for 5525 BCE shows a sudden sea-level rise of 15 meters (50 feet). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>
    *   Similar events are observed globally around this time, but the exact rise differs due to local landmass subsidence and tectonic plate movements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>
    *   Graham Hancock's research also dates the disappearance of Dwarka to this period. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>
    *   The formation of the Black Sea, from a freshwater lake to a saltwater sea due to the Atlantic waters breaking through the Bosphorus Channel, also occurred around 5525 BCE, as shown by geologists Ryan and Pitman of Columbia University. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>
*   **Raavana's Lanka:** The modern island of Sri Lanka is not considered Raavana's Lanka, as "Sri Lanka" was named in 1972, and ancient texts distinguished between Lanka and "Singhal" (old name for Sri Lanka). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:50:00">[56:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a> Raavana's Lanka was likely an island east of the Maldives, where a deep ocean now exists with an unusually thin Earth crust, suggesting past geological anomalies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:33:00">[54:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:00">[55:15:00]</a>
    *   Around the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]] time (14,200 years ago, 12,209 BCE), geological data shows a sudden sea-level rise of 13.5 meters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> This catastrophic event (CRE 1) is a plausible cause for the submergence of Raavana's Lanka. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>
*   **Plato's Atlantis:** Plato stated Atlantis was lost 9,000 years before his time (which was 2,000 years ago), placing its submergence around 11,000 years ago (9,000 BCE). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a> Geological data shows a catastrophic sea-level rise of 11.5 meters around 11,500 years ago (CRE 2), which aligns with the destruction of Atlantis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>

## Critique of Traditional Archaeology
Oak contends that many academically trained archaeologists and historians often "dislike" individuals who offer evidence-based historical insights without formal degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. He argues that the "rules of dirt archaeology," originating from European minds, can be limiting and lead to the dismissal of ancient texts unless "out and out evidence" fits their prescribed timeline. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a> This prevents them from "connecting the dots" or even looking for evidence of advanced human civilization existing more than 5,000 years ago, because their premise often assumes humans were "monkeys" at that time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a> However, science thrives on proving previous theories wrong, and new evidence should be embraced rather than fought. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>

Ajey Nagar, widely known as "CarryMina" in the YouTube world, maintains a distinct separation between his public persona and his private self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While "CarryMina" is presented as very open, Ajey Nagar keeps his personal life private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He believes some parts of his personal life should not be shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Personal Preferences and Privacy
Ajey Nagar identifies as a very private person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He states he was an introvert since childhood, preferring to stay at home rather than going out with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His room serves as his world, where he works, plays games, and relaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. His successful business on YouTube was built from this private space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. He highly values privacy and avoids "unwanted things" from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For instance, he dislikes when fans use the same language in front of his parents as he uses in his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Challenges of Teenage Fame
Being a famous teenager in India presents several difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Ajey notes that teenagers often do "stupid things," but his fame restricts his ability to enjoy typical teenage experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He rarely parties, and his personal "madness" as a teenager is curtailed by the presence of his manager at events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Fame has prevented him from experiencing basic life milestones:
*   **Driving**: He doesn't know how to drive because he never had time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **College Life**: He missed out on the typical college experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

This broken "normal cycle" of life makes him feel like he missed out on something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He desires to experience hostel life or flat sharing to understand college culture and create relatable content for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook and [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | Personal Growth]]
Ajey's basic aim is to continue his YouTube journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. He prefers to live day-by-day, focusing on what he needs to do today rather than planning extensively for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. His YouTube channel, CarryMina, has become a significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

He acknowledges that his dreams are "ending" at a young age, having already accomplished what many only aspire to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He finds this fact satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Learning and Experience
Ajey believes that the biggest [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | learning]] comes from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of gaining diverse experiences to truly learn, as formal education alone may not suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He encourages learning in one's own way, which might be difficult but ultimately leads to unique outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. His "best experience" is the daily freedom to do what he wants without parental pressure, having full independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

> [!TIP] Advice from Ajey Nagar
> "Always learn everything... the more experience you get in your life, the better it is because until you do not experience anything, there is only one education... learn in your own way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

To maintain stability and growth, he advises constant evolution and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He encourages trying new things without fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Parental Views and Public Scrutiny
His parents are also experiencing the newness of his fame and are learning how to deal with it alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While they generally don't interfere, his mother occasionally advises him not to use abusive language towards mothers or sisters in his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. He tries to be mindful during live streams, but admits he can get carried away, especially during horror games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Handling Pressure
Despite his massive following, Ajey states he never feels pressure from the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He attributes this to never having seen so many people together in real life, making the numbers abstract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. He avoids taking on pressure, noting that things go wrong when he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

His final advice is to constantly experience things, get out of your comfort zone, and never say no to anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Even bad experiences can become humorous memories later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

For individuals dealing with oily skin and [[causes_and_treatment_of_adult_acne | acne]] issues, especially in humid climates, a consistent and appropriate grooming routine is essential for maintaining a clean and tidy appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The goal is to look clean and fresh, as looking handsome is strongly associated with neatness and tidiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Daily Face Cleansing

Your primary tool for managing oily skin is a basic face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Application**: Rub the face wash between your hands to create a lather, then spread it all over your face and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Ensure the face wash is rubbed deep into your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: A mild face wash helps to remove excess oil and sebum from your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Oil accumulation on the skin increases the likelihood of [[causes_and_treatment_of_adult_acne | pimples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Washing**: Rinse thoroughly with tepid (room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Wash your face twice a day: once in the morning right after waking up, and once at night, one to two hours before bedtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This routine significantly helps in preventing and minimizing [[causes_and_treatment_of_adult_acne | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Young individuals, especially those in their teens or early twenties, or who frequent the gym, are more prone to [[causes_and_treatment_of_adult_acne | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Occasional Skincare Boost

A "bonus" [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] can be used on special occasions like important meetings or parties when you want to look extra neat and avoid appearing oily or grungy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This is not for daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

*   **Moisturizer**: Use a basic moisturizer to rehydrate your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, for oily skin types, daily use of moisturizer is not recommended as it can block pores and contribute to more [[causes_and_treatment_of_adult_acne | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Baby Powder**: Apply a small amount of baby powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Baby powder is preferred over regular talcum powder because it has very fine granules that are less likely to block pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Excessive use of baby powder can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Application**: Apply a little moisturizer and then a little baby powder. This combination can significantly reduce the oily appearance of your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Correction**: If too much product is applied, simply wipe it down with a slightly wet cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Key Considerations

*   **Personalization**: Just like with fitness, you need to determine your own [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] that best suits your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Skincare needs and treatments can vary significantly between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Hand Care**: Keep your hands clean and nails short to convey cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. If you develop calluses from activities like gym workouts, a little moisturizer rubbed into your hands can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Holistic Grooming**: Remember that looking handsome goes beyond just your face; overall cleanliness and tidiness, including aspects like hair and hands, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Belts are an integral part of [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | formal dressing]], and there are a few simple rules to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>:

*   **Material**: Avoid cotton belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Always opt for leather or faux leather belts that have a leathery feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Color Matching**: The color of your belt should always match the color of your shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. It doesn't need to be an exact match, but it should be a similar shade, for example, light brown shoes with a dark brown belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Versatile Colors**: Prioritize black and dark brown belts, as they are very versatile and stylish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

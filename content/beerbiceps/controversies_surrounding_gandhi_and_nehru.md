Traditional narratives of India's freedom struggle primarily focus on the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. However, historical analyses and contemporary discussions reveal several controversies and alternative viewpoints regarding their roles and policies during and after India's independence.

## Re-evaluating the Indian Freedom Movement

There is a growing sentiment, particularly among younger generations, that the history taught in Indian schools is "wrong," "irrelevant," and "hidden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Critics argue that history textbooks have presented a "linear, simplistic, monochromatic view" of the [[revision_of_indian_freedom_movement_history | Indian Freedom Movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, largely focusing on the non-violent movement while downplaying the significant contributions of armed resistance and revolutionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This approach is attributed to the post-independence political dispensation that aimed to highlight a specific viewpoint about the freedom struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

## Criticisms of Mahatma Gandhi

Despite his iconic status, Mahatma Gandhi's actions and policies have faced criticism:

*   **Impact on British Withdrawal**: Clement Attlee, the British Prime Minister at the time of India's independence, reportedly stated that the impact of Gandhi's non-violent Quit India Movement on Britain's decision to leave India was "minimal." Instead, he cited the heroics of the Indian National Army (INA) and the widespread mutinies in the Navy and Army (like the 1946 Naval Mutiny) as the primary reasons for the British departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **"Flip-flop Policies"**: Historian R.C. Majumdar, initially commissioned to write the official history of the freedom struggle, intended to be critical of Gandhi, suggesting that India might have gained freedom "several years or decades before" if not for his "flip-flop policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. Majumdar was removed from the project for this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **The Khilafat Movement and Partition**: Gandhi's leadership of the Khilafat movement, intended to foster Hindu-Muslim unity, is controversially viewed as having "very dangerous ramifications" and "crystallized" the "seeds of partition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Critics argue that supporting a communal issue related to the Caliph of Turkey was a form of "bartering Muslim support for the Freedom Movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. The failure of its promises reportedly led to "Hindu genocides" in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Assassination and Public Sentiment**: Nathuram Godse and his associates believed Gandhi "needs to be bumped off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a> because they perceived him as a "national security threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This sentiment intensified around January 12, 1948, when Gandhi announced a fast unto death if the Indian government did not pay 50 crores to Pakistan, despite Pakistani incursions into Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. Refugees in Delhi were also openly protesting against him, wanting him to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Caste Eradication**: While Gandhi advocated for the removal of "untouchability," [[role_of_revolutionaries_like_bhagat_singh_and_savarkar | Savarkar]] is noted for standing for a "complete elimination of caste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.

## Criticisms of Jawaharlal Nehru

Nehru's government and legacy have also come under scrutiny for shaping the historical narrative:

*   **Suppression of Alternate Narratives**: After independence, Nehru's government is accused of strategically suppressing "all opposing viewpoints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a> to ensure that "a certain viewpoint about the freedom struggle" was highlighted, particularly the non-violent movement and the Congress's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.
*   **Stifling Freedom of Expression**: Despite being lauded as a "great democrat and a liberal," Nehru's era reportedly saw the "stifling of freedom of expression." An example given is the poet Majrooh Sultanpuri, who was jailed for a year and a half for calling Nehru "Hitler's chacha" in a poem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.
*   **Control over History Writing**: Historians who did not "tow the line" set by the government risked losing their jobs, patronage, awards, and fellowships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This influence meant that the "narrative that was set" highlighted only the non-violent movement and the Congress's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **"Brown Sahib" Persona**: Nehru was infamously quoted as saying he was "the last Englishman," which contributed to the perception of him as a "brown sahib" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This suggests a continuation of certain colonial-era bureaucratic and intellectual structures post-independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Partition Violence**: The podcast points to the 1948 anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin carnage across Maharashtra, spearheaded by Congress goons, as a retaliation against Gandhi's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. This violence, including ethnic cleansing and property loss, reportedly saw no cases filed and no justice, despite the perpetrators being from the same party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

### Geopolitical Influence on Historical Narratives

Some suggest that the branding of Gandhi and Nehru, particularly their emphasis in the global perception of the [[revision_of_indian_freedom_movement_history | Indian Freedom Movement]], was strengthened by support from Western geopolitical powers like America and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>. This narrative was seen as a "win-win situation" where India was presented as gaining freedom peacefully, and the colonial masters were shown in a good light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. This, in turn, led to the marginalization of those who led the armed struggle, sometimes labeling them as "revolutionary terrorists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

Overall, the discussion highlights the argument that a complete and objective understanding of India's past requires examining diverse viewpoints and challenging the official historical narrative, especially given that many historical truths were "suppressed" or "covered up" for political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

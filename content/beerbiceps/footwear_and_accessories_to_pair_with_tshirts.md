When selecting footwear and [[adding_personality_and_detail_to_outfits_with_accessories | accessories]] to complement a t-shirt, it is important to remember that t-shirts are generally considered the most casual piece of dressing in a wardrobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This means that formal or semi-formal options should typically be avoided unless specific layering is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Footwear
When choosing footwear for t-shirts, the guiding principle is to match the casual nature of the garment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Footwear to Avoid
*   **Formal Shoes**: Do not pair t-shirts with formal shoes that are worn to the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Semi-Formal Shoes**: Boots and loafers should also be avoided when wearing t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Recommended Footwear
*   **Sneakers**: Sneakers are an excellent choice to pair with t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Flip-flops**: Flip-flops are also suitable for pairing with t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

These casual footwear options pair beautifully with t-shirts, especially when the colors are matched perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Watches
[[watches_and_accessories_for_men | Watches]] can significantly impact the overall tone of an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Watches to Avoid
*   **Metallic Watches**: These are primarily for formal occasions and typically require a shirt to be worn to pull them off effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Recommended Watches
*   **Leather-Strapped Watches**: These can be considered semi-formal and can elevate a t-shirt look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to [[clothing_and_color_combinations_for_men | match the color]] of your watch to the color of your overall outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Elegant leather-strapped watches can make your overall look appear more mature, aligning with the [[tshirt_maturity_scale_and_ageappropriate_styles | t-shirt maturity scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Casual Watches**: Choosing a more casual watch can set a fun tone for the rest of the outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Ultimately, t-shirts are designed for casual occasions like lunch dates, meeting friends, or going for a jog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The only exception where a t-shirt can appear slightly formal is when a plain white or black t-shirt is paired with a formal-looking jacket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For formal settings such as dates, office environments, or corporate parties, more formal options like shirts and polos should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Overview of a Storied Career

Kareena Kapoor Khan views her career as a fortunate journey where she has been able to pursue what she truly desired and enjoyed doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:10">[03:29:10]</a>. Her "biggest asset" has always been her confidence, which she believes has also inspired people through her characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. She considers herself "very lucky" to have loved her job every minute since she was 17, reflecting on her journey from that age to 43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:10">[03:31:10]</a>. The daily experience of being on set, in front of the camera, meeting actors and directors, and playing diverse [[roles_and_challenges_in_kareenas_film_career | roles]] has brought her immense happiness and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:10">[03:52:10]</a>.

Kareena describes acting as an "intoxication in good sense," a "trans" feeling she experiences every time she is in front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:10">[04:24:10]</a>. She emphasizes that the best acting and art comes from a deeper place of wanting to give one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:10">[05:07:10]</a>.

## Evolution of Ambition and Priorities

Looking back, Kareena notes a significant shift in her ambition and focus. In her 20s, there was a "different kind of fire" and "hunger to be the best," constantly striving to do more films and achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:10">[06:51:10]</a>. However, after nearly 25 years in the industry, her hunger has evolved to include a desire for "a little bit of peace" and a deeper understanding of the characters she plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:10">[07:14:10]</a>. She feels that a person's growth between ages 20 and 43 directly impacts their growth as an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:10">[07:29:10]</a>.

[[the_impact_of_motherhood_and_family_on_kareenas_life | Motherhood and being a wife]] have profoundly changed her, bringing a different kind of responsibility into her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:10">[07:42:10]</a>. She no longer solely chases success or box office hits as everything, but rather aims to prove herself as a good actor and star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:10">[07:54:10]</a>. Her mind has expanded, and her husband, children, and friends have helped her grow into the person she is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:10">[08:12:10]</a>. Her current challenge is to see "how far I can go with mental peace" and be at peace with herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:10">[08:28:10]</a>.

## Approaching Roles and Self-Confidence

Kareena believes that while she makes many things "look easy," some [[roles_and_challenges_in_kareenas_film_career | roles]] require her to go "extremely deep" within herself to deliver a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:10">[05:37:10]</a>. She cited *Laal Singh Chaddha*, *Heroine*, and *Tashan* as films she loved doing and gave a lot of thought to, despite them not being box office successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:10">[05:49:10]</a>. She is particularly excited by "grey" characters, finding human beings who are a "little bit grey" the most interesting to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:10">[06:21:10]</a>.

On the topic of [[kareenas_approach_to_acting_and_selfconfidence | self-confidence]], Kareena states she can only act to play characters, not in real life, as her emotions are transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:10">[09:50:10]</a>. Her confidence has been her "biggest ammunition and biggest asset" in her profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:10">[10:46:10]</a>.

### The Impact of *Jab We Met*

The character of Geet from *Jab We Met* remains iconic and highly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:10">[12:07:10]</a>. Kareena acknowledges that people still recite dialogues from the film and that it continues to resonate due to Geet's lovable, confident, and innocent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:10">[11:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:10">[12:11:10]</a>. She feels the film was "way ahead of its time" and connects with modern concepts like "situationships" due to Geet's emotional depth and heart-led decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:10">[14:04:10]</a>.

## Challenges and Sacrifices of Stardom

Despite her success, Kareena admits to facing significant challenges. She describes the film industry as demanding, where actors often have to perform regardless of personal struggles, even if they are "dying of fever" or going through personal crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:10">[05:41:10]</a>. There is "no room to have a bad day" in public, and one must always present as a "perfect star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:10">[05:20:10]</a>. She candidly shares that she has often felt "lonely" throughout her journey because people cannot truly understand what actors experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

Kareena has experienced numerous failures in her career, acknowledging "a string of films that haven't worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a>. She admits to being "very upset" and crying herself to sleep on many nights due to films not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:10">[03:37:10]</a>. However, she believes her failures have contributed more to her growth than her successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:10">[04:09:10]</a>. She makes a conscious effort not to let people sense her failures, even when they're happening, and might take a step back to reassess why films aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:10">[02:37:10]</a>.

### The "Size Zero" Phase
Reflecting on her "size zero" phase for *Tashan*, Kareena clarified it was a challenge she undertook, taking almost a year and a half to achieve, and she doesn't believe such a specific body type is necessary for action films today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>. She stated she is ambitious but not to the point of harming her mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Future Outlook

Kareena emphasizes that she makes career decisions from her heart, even if it means saying "no" to certain films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. She feels much more at peace now compared to her 20s and 30s, confidently taking time off work and sticking to her decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:10">[02:40:10]</a>. Unlike her younger self, who constantly chased more films, she now prioritizes chilling with friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.

Despite her achievements, Kareena states she is "satisfied but not satiated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:10">[09:57:10]</a>. She maintains a "hunger for more" and a constant feeling that she "can do that," which keeps her on her toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. She works for herself and her own satisfaction, rather than for others, wanting to prove to herself that she will always be this person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

She expresses happiness and contentment with her family, valuing the time with her children and husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. While she hopes to keep working until she's 80, she acknowledges that life is about striving for perfection, even if it's unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. She strives to be happy and content in the middle of both her professional and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

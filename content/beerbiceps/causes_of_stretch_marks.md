Stretch marks are lesions or damage that appear on the body, typically in areas with higher fat percentages such as the chest, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They initially manifest as red or purple, transitioning to a white color over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While more treatable when raw (red or purple), they can still be addressed once they turn white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Stretch marks are a common issue that affects most human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It's important to educate oneself about their [[stretch_marks_science | science]] and [[prevention_of_stretch_marks | prevention]] rather than letting them affect one's [[emotional_impact_of_stretch_marks | emotional state of mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Science Behind Stretch Marks
Every individual is susceptible to developing stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Understanding the [[stretch_marks_science | science]] of skin structure is key to comprehending their formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The skin has three primary layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:
*   **Epidermis** The outermost layer, primarily responsible for protection from the external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Hypodermis** The innermost layer, which provides insulation due to its fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Dermis** The middle layer, where stretch marks originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The dermis gives the skin its structure, specifically its pliability (ability to stretch) and elasticity (ability to return to its original shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The pliability and elasticity of the skin are maintained by connective tissues, mainly collagen and elastin fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. These fibers originate from cells called **fibroblasts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A higher degree of fibroblasts leads to more collagen and elastin, contributing to healthier, more resilient skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Stretch marks occur because the body produces fewer fibroblasts, leading to a diminished amount of collagen and elastin fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. When the skin stretches with insufficient collagen and elastin, it becomes damaged instead of returning to its original form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Underlying Factors Affecting Fibroblasts
There are two main reasons for the reduction in fibroblast production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>:

1.  **Genetics:** Some individuals are genetically predisposed to having fewer fibroblasts, making them more prone to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
2.  **Stress:** [[role_of_stress_and_mental_wellbeing_in_skin_conditions | Stress]], whether mental (e.g., work, studies) or physical (e.g., over-exercising), causes the body to produce more cortisone, the stress hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Elevated cortisone levels negatively affect the formation of fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Direct Causes of Skin Stretching
The actual stretching of the skin, combined with compromised collagen and elastin, leads to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Common factors causing this stretching include:

*   **Rapid Weight Change:** Both rapid weight gain and rapid weight loss can cause stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Rapid Weight Gain:** The skin stretches more than it can accommodate, leading to dermis damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Rapid Weight Loss:** Losing weight too quickly can elevate cortisone levels, making the skin more susceptible to stretch marks as it struggles to keep up with the rapid change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Healthy weight gain is about 2-3 kgs per week, and healthy weight loss is no more than 0.5 kgs per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Pregnancy:** The rapid expansion of the abdomen combined with elevated cortisone levels during pregnancy frequently results in stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Adolescence:** During growth spurts, particularly in teenage girls and boys, muscles and bones grow quickly, and the skin may not be able to keep pace with this rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions can increase an individual's proneness to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Medications:** Some medications, such as corticosteroid creams, oral steroids, or injectable (systemic) steroids, can also make a person more susceptible to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

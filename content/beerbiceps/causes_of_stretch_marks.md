Stretch marks are a common issue affecting most human beings, appearing as lesions or damage marks on the body, particularly in areas with higher fat percentages like the chest, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They typically start as red or purple before transitioning into a white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Every individual is prone to developing stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Science Behind Stretch Marks

The skin is composed of three primary layers:
*   **Epidermis** The outer layer responsible for protection from the external world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Hypodermis** The innermost layer, containing the fat layer and responsible for insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Dermis** The middle layer, which is where stretch marks originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The dermis's main function is to give structure to the skin, specifically its pliability (ability to stretch) and elasticity (ability to return to original shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Role of Fibroblasts, Collagen, and Elastin

Stretch marks occur due to damage in the dermis because the skin is stretched beyond its capacity, and there are insufficient collagen and elastin fibers to allow it to return to its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

The underlying reason for this is a reduced production of fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Fibroblasts are a type of cell that serve as origin cells for the body's connective tissue, primarily collagen and elastin fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Collagen and elastin fibers are crucial for the skin's structure, elasticity, and pliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Fewer fibroblasts lead to lesser collagen and elastin fibers, making the skin more prone to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Primary Causes of Stretch Marks

The primary reasons for reduced fibroblast production and subsequent stretch marks include:

### 1. Genetics
Some individuals are genetically predisposed to having fewer fibroblasts than normal, making them more susceptible to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### 2. Stress
Both mental and physical stress can cause the body to produce more cortisol, also known as the stress hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This hormone is produced by the adrenal gland, especially in "fight or flight" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Elevated cortisol levels negatively affect the formation of fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

An example of physical stress that can elevate cortisol levels is over-exercising or putting the body through excessive physical strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### 3. Rapid Weight Changes
*   **Rapid Weight Gain:** When weight is gained too quickly, the skin stretches more than expected and cannot retain its original shape, damaging the dermis and leading to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Rapid Weight Loss:** Rapid weight loss can also elevate cortisol levels, making the skin more prone to stretch marks because it cannot keep up with the rapid change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   A healthy rate of weight gain is approximately 2-3 kgs per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   For weight loss, even if mildly obese, one should not lose more than 0.5 kgs a week, as exceeding this rate is too rapid and elevates cortisol levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 4. Pregnancy
During pregnancy, the stomach significantly expands, and cortisol levels are elevated, contributing to the formation of stretch marks in pregnant women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 5. Adolescence and Growth Spurts
Especially during teenage years, both in young girls and many boys undergoing growth spurts, muscles and bones grow rapidly. The skin may not be able to keep pace with this growth, resulting in stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 6. Medical Conditions
Certain medical conditions can make individuals more prone to developing stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### 7. Medications
Some medications, such as corticosteroid creams, oral steroids, or systemic (injectable) steroids, can increase susceptibility to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Prevention
Understanding these causes is vital for [[prevention_of_stretch_marks | preventing stretch marks]] in the long term, especially if an individual is prone to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Key aspects of prevention include proper hydration and [[impact_of_diet_on_skin_health | nutrition]], including a protein-rich diet and adequate intake of vitamins C, D, E, and zinc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

It delves into the nature of ghosts, the work of [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal investigators]], and the role of [[role_of_science_and_technology_in_paranormal_studies | science and technology]] and [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | spirituality and witchcraft]] in understanding these phenomena. The conversation is aimed at "believers" rather than [[Skepticism and belief in the supernatural | skeptics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Types of Supernatural Entities

Indian [[Cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits | cultural perceptions of hauntings and spirits]] and mythology provide descriptions of several supernatural entities:

*   **Chudel and Diyan**
    *   These entities share a similar origin theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
    *   It is believed that a woman who dies during childbirth or while pregnant, and is not properly cremated with all rituals, turns into a Chudel due to latent desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
    *   Once a Chudel, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women, acting as a vengeful entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A Diyan is similar in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Yakshin**
    *   Described as demigoddesses, they are believed to be on Earth, often in their evil forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
    *   They are beautiful and voluptuous initially, but their true evil form emerges after seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
    *   Their victims are usually men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   They are believed to reside in Alkapuri, a realm governed by Kubera (Ravana's brother and protector of wealth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **Pishach (Ghoul)**
    *   From Hindu mythology, a Pishach is created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
    *   Unlike poltergeists, a Pishach can kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Poltergeists**
    *   These are considered "noisy ghosts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
    *   They are mischievous and naughty, trying to disorient people and sap their energies, but they are not evil and rarely kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Betal**
    *   A Betal is a hanging ghost, resembling a gargoyle, but usually formless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
    *   It is a man who died with unfulfilled wishes and remains attached to a tree, which is seen as a permanent structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
    *   Betals are believed to haunt people passing by, travel to their homes, and create havoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Ghosts

Generally, the realm of ghosts is believed to be full of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. When someone dies an unnatural death before their time, they spend the remainder of that time as a ghost in this realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

While many ghosts are considered good, the evil ones are those with something unfulfilled in their lives or who experienced an unjust or violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Insights from [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | Paranormal Investigations]]

Neil D Silva, as a horror writer, has worked with [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal investigators]] to research his books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He notes that no two [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal investigators]] have the exact same theory regarding ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

*   **Jay Alani** is described as a rationalist who believes a significant part of the [[paranormal_activities and supernatural_entities | paranormal world]] in India is commercially propagated superstition, while a portion is genuinely [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. His investigations often reveal human mischief as the root cause, or an epicenter like a possessed curio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.
*   **Sarbajit M**, another investigator, believes [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | paranormal energies]] are ubiquitous, representing another dimension that can see us even if we cannot interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### Notable Investigation Accounts

*   **Bhubaneswar Village Haunting**: Sarbajit M investigated a village where young boys would inexplicably walk out of their homes at night, cross a highway, enter a forest, and hang themselves from a specific tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.
    *   Sarbajit and his team, including psychics like Puja, sensed a huge mass of dark energy around the tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
    *   They experienced difficulties, including a mini-tornado engulfing the tree and hearing voices, as well as seeing tall black shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
    *   Villagers attempting to cut down the tree would fall sick, leading to the belief that the tree resisted being cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with the Paranormal

Both the host and Neil D Silva have had [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult experiences]] that have influenced their work and beliefs.

*   **Fear of the Dark**: Both shared a profound childhood fear of the dark, which later transformed into artistic expression through horror writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Neil D Silva recounted a recurring vision of a man dropping from the ceiling in a dark room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Goa Experience**: While writing a horror novel in a lonely cottage in Goa, Neil D Silva felt a cold, material presence pass by him and observed lights flickering only in his room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Witchcraft Encounter**: The host shared a first-hand account of being at the receiving end of what felt like witchcraft after a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
    *   A psychic friend had previously warned him about haunted locations in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a> and possessed the ability to create a "protective field" by rubbing and clapping his hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:00">[28:33:00]</a>.
    *   During the date, the woman, who was into witchcraft, took him to locations his psychic friend had identified as haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>.
    *   He felt dizzy and a strong urge to leave, and later his psychic friend called him, sensing a "dark aura" around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.
    *   A given mantra and a salt water bath were prescribed to cleanse him, and during meditation, he felt a "long pin" shoved into his finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
    *   This was interpreted as an attempt to "take something that someone else owns and bring it to yourself" through black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>.

## [[Role of spirituality and witchcraft in paranormal phenomena | Spirituality and Witchcraft]]

There is a strong spiritual connection to the [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | paranormal world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

*   **Spiritual Cleansing**: Practices like mantra chanting and meditation are believed to cleanse environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. Salt water baths are also common for washing off negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>.
*   **Trees and Spirits**: Trees, especially banyan and peepal trees, are believed to house spirits and be a "safe heaven" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. There's a common belief not to walk under them at night, or to urinate on them, due to fear of possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.
*   **Black Magic**: The village of Mayong in Assam, near the Kamakhya Temple, is considered the birthplace of black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>. Practitioners there are said to use it for healing ailments through tantrics and ojas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.

## [[role of science and technology in paranormal studies | Role of Science and Technology]]

Despite personal experiences, a major challenge in [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal studies]] is the lack of direct scientific proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

*   **EMF Detection**: [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | Paranormal investigators]] use devices like K2 meters to detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. While these devices show increased EMF in certain "haunted" areas, it's an observed proof, not direct evidence of a ghostly entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>.
*   **Future Technology**: The advancement of technology, such as Japan's tech to record and play back dreams, suggests future possibilities for proving or understanding other dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

## Influence of Media

Horror stories and content, particularly those involving ghosts, are best enjoyed when "slightly edited through the power of filmmaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The podcast itself incorporated music to enhance the scary atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

Films like *The Conjuring* series, featuring [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal investigators]] Ed and Lorraine Warren, are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. The Warrens are known for their museum containing possessed artifacts, including the Annabelle doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

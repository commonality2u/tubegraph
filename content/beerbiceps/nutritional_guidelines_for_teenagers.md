Your teenage years are exceptionally important, as they determine your physical height and body aesthetics for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Nutrition is one of four crucial factors that can be modified to maximize both [[height_growth_during_teenage_years | height growth]] and [[physical_fitness_for_teenagers | fitness levels]] during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## General Nutritional Rules

When it comes to nutrition for teenagers, several ground rules should be followed:
*   Avoid [[meal_plan_for_keto_diet | ketogenic diets]], as there is insufficient long-term research on the effects of low-carb diets on growth in teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Do not follow excessively [[dietcentric_weight_loss_strategies | low-calorie diets]] for weight loss unless you are severely obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Instead, concentrate on fundamental dietary adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Eliminate sugar and sugary drinks from your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Stop consuming junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Prioritize eating home-cooked meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Specific Macronutrients

### Protein
It is essential for both boys and girls to focus on adequate protein intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Contrary to outdated beliefs, modern research indicates that high-protein diets do not harm the kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Historically, lower protein intake in some cultures, such as Indian culture, might hypothetically contribute to shorter average heights compared to Western or African cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Adequate protein intake is vital for:
*   Muscle development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
*   Managing body fat percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
*   Maximizing [[height_growth_during_teenage_years | height growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>

> [!TIP] Protein Requirement
> Aim for at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Strive to include 20 to 25 grams of protein in each meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Carbohydrates
When it comes to carbohydrates, adhere to these simple rules:
*   Minimize sugar intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   Minimize junk food consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Focus on clean carbohydrates, especially home-cooked options like roti, brown rice, oats, or upma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   Increase the intake of these healthy carbohydrate sources in your meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   Consume at least three meals per day with a good, healthy portion of carbohydrates, such as a large bowl of rice or a serving of rotis, to ensure you feel full and satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Do not cut carbohydrates from your diet** while you are still growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The teenage years are crucial for development, and nutrition plays a significant role in overall health, physical appearance, and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Proper dietary choices during this period can maximize both fitness levels and height potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Key Nutritional Principles for Teenagers

### Avoid Restrictive Diets

*   **No [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diets]]**: Teenagers should not follow ketogenic diets due to insufficient long-term research on low-carb diets and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Avoid [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | low-calorie diets]]**: Unless severely obese, teenagers should avoid going too low on calories when trying to lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Instead, focus on fundamental dietary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### General Dietary Recommendations

*   **Eliminate sugar and sugary drinks**: Quit consuming sugar and sugary beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Prioritize home-cooked meals**: Opt for food prepared at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Importance of Protein

Protein intake is vital for teenagers, regardless of gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Contrary to some older beliefs, modern research indicates that high-protein diets are not harmful to the kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Some hypothesize that higher protein intake in Western or African cultures might contribute to greater physical height compared to cultures with lower protein intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Adequate [[nutrition_basics | protein intake]] is crucial for muscle development, managing fat percentage, and supporting height growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **General rule**: Consume at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Per meal**: Aim for 20 to 25 grams of protein per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Carbohydrate Guidelines

*   **Minimize sugar and junk food intake**: Reduce consumption of sugar and junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on clean carbohydrates**: Increase intake of home-cooked, clean carbohydrates such as roti, brown rice, oats, and upma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Do not eliminate carbs**: Do not cut carbohydrates from your diet while still growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Meal portions**: Include a good, healthy portion of carbs in at least three meals, such as a large bowl of rice or a serving of rotis, to ensure satiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[0:10:20]</a>.

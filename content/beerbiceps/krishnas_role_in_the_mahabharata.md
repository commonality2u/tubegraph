[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] role in the Mahabharata marks a significant shift in his divine manifestations. After his early life, known as *Madura Leelas*, he transitions to *Aishwarya Leelas*, where he overtly displays his divinity and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.

## Transition to Aishwarya Leelas
[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] journey from Vrindavan to Mathura is a poignant moment, marked by the deep sadness of the Gopis who loved him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. In Mathura, he kills Kamsa and re-establishes Ugrasena as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>. This act sets the stage for his involvement in larger, more cosmic events.

## The Purpose of Intervention
[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] primary purpose in the Mahabharata was to cleanse the Earth of *adharmic* (unrighteous) kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The Earth goddess, Bhudevi, had approached him, burdened by the weight of *adharma* and the tyrannical rule of these kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] used the conflict between the Pandavas and the Kauravas as a pretext for this complete destruction (*samula*) of unrighteous forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16">[01:48:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Expert Strategizer
[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] is portrayed as an expert strategizer, not seeking a peaceful mediation between the two warring factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>. He acts as the Pandavas' mentor, counsel, and strategic advisor, guiding them through the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. He does not take up arms himself during the war; instead, he serves as Arjuna's charioteer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.

## The Bhagavad Gita
One of [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] most phenomenal *Aishwarya Leelas* within the Mahabharata is the delivery of the Bhagavad Gita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a>. This text, comprising 18 chapters and 700 *shlokas*, is his ultimate declaration of divinity and provides all that is needed for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:18">[02:10:18]</a>. He declares that those who dedicate their all to him, constantly and without break, will be taken care of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a>.

## Moral and Dharmic Authority
[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] asserts his authority as the universe's conscience keeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:35">[01:55:35]</a>. This is exemplified in his fierce stance against Karna during the war. When Karna's chariot wheel gets stuck, and he protests against being attacked while unarmed, [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] reminds him of his past *adharmic* actions, particularly his instigation to disrobe Draupadi publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>. He emphasizes that one's actions throughout life determine their end, and a life of *adharma* does not suddenly warrant a *dharmic* end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.

Similarly, in the incident involving Dronacharya, [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] instructs Yudhisthira to announce "Ashwatthama has been killed" to demoralize Drona, not specifying that it was an elephant with the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:13">[01:57:13]</a>. When Yudhisthira whispers "naro va kunjaro va" (man or elephant), [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] holds him accountable for his deviation from the instruction, highlighting his role as a strict mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:11">[01:58:11]</a>.

## Post-Mahabharata Life and Departure
After the 18-day Mahabharata war, [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] life continues for 36 more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:08">[02:03:08]</a>. This period is also mentioned in the Mahabharata itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:20">[02:03:20]</a>.

Following the war, Gandhari, mother of the Kauravas, overcome by grief at the loss of her 100 sons, curses [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]]. She blames him for the destruction and curses him to die silently by a hunter's arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:31">[02:05:31]</a>. [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] smilingly accepts the curse, stating that it was how he had already chosen to depart, and she wasted her spiritual merit (*Tapas*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>.

After the war, [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] returns to Dwarka. There, he witnesses the self-destruction of his own clan, the Yadavas, due to infighting and their own misdeeds, which was also part of Gandhari's curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:50">[02:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>. He retires to a forest in Dwarka, where he sits under a tree with his foot outstretched. A hunter mistakes his foot for a deer's ear and shoots him with a poisoned arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:22">[02:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>. The poison spreads, and [[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna]] returns to *Shashwat Goloka*, his eternal abode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a>. Prior to this, he instructs Balarama, his elder brother and the seventh child of Devaki, to return to his original form as Adishesha, who then slithers into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:04">[02:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:15">[02:09:15]</a>.

[[krishnas_connection_to_the_mahabharat_and_arjun | Krishna's]] life and eventual departure demonstrate his fulfillment of his divine purpose, blessing devotees, eliminating *rakshasas*, and cleansing the Earth through monumental events like the Mahabharata war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:43">[02:09:43]</a>.

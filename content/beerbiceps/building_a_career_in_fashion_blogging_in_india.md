## Early Life and Motivation

The foundation of Ashna's career in fashion blogging was significantly shaped by her family situation and early life experiences. Her mother, a single parent, raised her and her mother's family, including her grandparents, her mother's aunt (masi), and her mother's older sister who has Down syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>. Her mother was the sole earner, supporting four people at home in addition to Ashna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This upbringing instilled a strong sense of responsibility from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

Ashna recalls a point during her college years when her family had only 1,500 rupees in their account with no clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>. This challenging financial background deeply motivates her. Today, she dedicates her earnings to her mother, desiring for her mother to manage the household and enjoy life, including travel and luxury items, which she never had the opportunity to do previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

## Journey into Fashion Blogging

Ashna's venture into [[pursuing_a_career_in_fashion_blogging | fashion blogging]] began approximately five years prior to this interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. She initially started an online store on Facebook, importing goods from China and selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>. She then started posting her own outfit pictures on Instagram, which led to followers encouraging her to start a blog due to her styling abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:46">[04:04:46]</a>.

At the time, blogging in India was just beginning, and its future was uncertain, making it somewhat of a gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:04">[04:16:04]</a>. Her online store served as a backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:52">[04:22:52]</a>. Over time, the blog took precedence, and the store became secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:05">[04:29:05]</a>.

Her first paid collaboration came a year after starting her blog, with India Circus, for 5,000 rupees for a blog post and three Instagram posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:43">[04:33:43]</a>. Currently, she is able to secure brand deals that run into five or six digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:04">[04:56:04]</a>. Her business, which started as a hobby, now generates between 5 to 10 lakhs a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

## Business Model and Operations

Ashna's [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_running_a_successful_blog | blogging business]] operates primarily through brand collaborations. The process involves:
*   **Initial contact:** Brands reach out via email, detailing the product, campaign, or sale they wish to promote, along with the desired number of posts and a brief concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:01">[05:27:01]</a>.
*   **Selection:** Ashna reviews the brand, concept, and product, only taking on collaborations with brands she genuinely connects with and loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:04">[05:41:04]</a>.
*   **Production:** Once a collaboration is accepted, the production phase begins, including content planning, scheduling shoot dates, and arranging for producers, locations, and photographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>.
*   **Financial negotiation:** Ashna has a manager, who is her mother's cousin, to handle all financial discussions, as she identifies this as her weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:03">[06:09:03]</a>. She believes in surrounding herself with people who complement her weaknesses with their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:02">[06:26:02]</a>.
*   **Content delivery:** After the content outcome is finalized, the post goes live, but the team handles everything subsequent to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:08">[06:03:08]</a>.

## Challenges and Mindset

Ashna describes her life as a "dream life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, acknowledging that despite the stress and commitments, she is grateful for her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>. One significant challenge she faced was during the early stages of her blog, about a year and a half in, when it wasn't generating as much income as her online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:02">[08:03:02]</a>. Her mother advised her to shut down the blog and focus on the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:09">[08:11:09]</a>. However, Ashna's stubbornness led her to fight to continue both, a decision she is now immensely glad she made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:09">[08:20:09]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Ashna offers several pieces of advice for young people considering entrepreneurial careers, particularly those who do not wish to work for others:
*   **Find your passion and push it:** Once you discover what you love, don't give up on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Let your work speak:** Even if you are shy or not very social, if your work is good, it will speak for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.
*   **Patience and hard work:** These are crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Be true to yourself:** Don't lose yourself in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   **Execution:** Don't just have ideas; ensure they are brought to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Stubbornness (determination):** Her own stubbornness helped her persist when others suggested she give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

Ashna also believes strongly in manifestation, where thinking positively and putting out good energies into the world will bring good things back, provided one also works towards those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. She feels that people like her are a huge inspiration to every single [[role_of_youth_in_shaping_india | young Indian person]] who is staying in India and trying to build an [[indias_global_economic_strategy and entrepreneurship | Indian business]] while staying true to their "desi" self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

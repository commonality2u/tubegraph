## General Shoe Care

*   **New Shoes**
    When you purchase a new pair of shoes, especially those meant for more formal or important occasions, reserve them for those specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Sneaker Care

Sneakers are a very fashionable choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The white trim is often a highlight of a sneaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **Usage**
    *   Avoid wearing new sneakers outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Wear sneakers only indoors when going to parties, dates, or restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Especially for white sneakers, avoid wearing them out anywhere, as they can get dusty even indoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

*   **Cleaning**
    *   Upon returning home, wipe the white portion of your sneakers to keep them clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Styling**
    *   For a monochrome sneaker, consider pairing it with white laces to elevate the outfit, making it look more casual and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Loafer Care

Classy loafers are typically made from suede material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, which requires specific care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

*   **Suede Loafers**
    *   For black suede shoes, use a black suede spray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   For suede shoes of any other color, use a plain suede spray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Using these sprays helps increase the shelf life of the shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Everyday Wear

For everyday wear, boots and flip-flops are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

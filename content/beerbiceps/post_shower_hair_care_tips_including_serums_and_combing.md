A [[importance_of_mens_hair_care_routine | hair care routine]] is essential for men's grooming, including post-shower steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Towel Drying Hair
After showering, gently towel dry your hair by dabbing it; avoid ruffling it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Using a Comb
While a comb might not be ideal for shaping unmanageable hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, it can still be beneficial for hair health.

### Benefits of Combing
*   **Scalp Massage:** Combing helps in massaging your hair and scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Improved Blood Circulation:** Stroke your hair along its natural direction of growth, ensuring the comb makes contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This action increases blood circulation to your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Hair Serum Application
Using a hair serum takes your post-shower treatment to a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. While it doesn't offer many health benefits like other [[impact_of_hair_products_and_how_to_use_them | hair products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, it primarily focuses on improving the look of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Benefits of Hair Serum
*   Makes hair appear thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   Adds gloss and shine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   Forms a protective coating that shields hair from excess humidity and dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### How to Apply
1.  Take a coin-sized portion of serum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
2.  Rub it in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
3.  Apply it onto the body of your hair (not the scalp) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> while your hair is still slightly wet from the shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

After applying serum, you can comb your hair, ensuring the comb touches the scalp to increase blood circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Hand Styling
If you have rough hair, combs might make it look worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. In such cases, simply playing around with your hair using your hands can achieve the desired look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

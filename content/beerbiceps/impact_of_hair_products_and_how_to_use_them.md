## Nature of Hair Products
Hair products are chemicals that are not naturally found in your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Frequency of Use
It is advisable to use hair products only occasionally, such as once every two weeks or once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. They can be used for special occasions like parties or filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

After using hair products, it is crucial to wash them off properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The recommended cleaning process includes:
1.  Washing hair with water first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
2.  Applying a small amount of [[benefits_and_methods_of_hair_oiling | oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

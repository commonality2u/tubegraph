Isotretinoin, commonly known by brand names like Accutane or Roaccutane, is a form of oral [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | retinol]] (vitamin A precursor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. It is one of the most widely searched terms related to [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]] on YouTube globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## How Isotretinoin Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>
Isotretinoin works by drying out all glands in the body, including tear glands, leading to dry vagina, dry eyes, dry skin, and dry lips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. Specifically for [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]], it reduces the size of oil glands and increases cell turnover, which helps reduce clogging and oiliness of the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.

## Effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>
This medication is highly effective for almost anyone with an oil gland, which is a prerequisite for having [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. It can dramatically clear up [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]], even in cases where individuals have poor [[Diet lifestyle and stress management for skincare | dietary habits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.

## Side Effects and Precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a>
While effective, isotretinoin comes with several significant precautions and potential side effects:
*   **Teratogenicity**: It is teratogenic, meaning it can cause harm to a baby if a woman taking it becomes pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. However, recent studies indicate it is not teratogenic in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:29">[01:40:29]</a>.
*   **Organ Toxicity**: It can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and may derange lipid profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a>.
*   **Drying Effects**: Beyond the oil glands, it causes widespread dryness, including brittle hair and increased dry skin, which can lead to complications like lip pigmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.
*   **Scar Reduction**: While it can reduce scars due to increased cell turnover, stronger and more direct methods are often preferred for scar treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>.

It is important to note that most of these complications are rare, and a doctor would consider these risks before prescribing the medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>.

## When Is It Recommended? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>
A dermatologist may use isotretinoin for severe or hereditary [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]] where no other causes can be found, and when [[Diet lifestyle and stress management for skincare | diet]] and hormones are already regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>.

The goal is to get the [[Causes and treatment of adult acne | acne]] under control quickly, rather than long-term use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. The approach prioritizes addressing the immediate, painful infection and inflammation first, often with a short course of antibiotics and probiotics to mitigate gut disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.

## Alternatives to Long-Term Oral Treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>
Instead of prolonged systemic treatment, dermatologists may opt for procedures that target oil glands locally. One such procedure is micro-needling radiofrequency, where tiny needles deliver radiofrequency energy at specific depths to shrink the oil glands permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>. This method also helps treat [[Natural and medical treatments for stretch marks | acne scars]] by stimulating collagen production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.

## Long-Term and Permanent Usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>
Some individuals, particularly in urban areas, use low-dose isotretinoin (e.g., 5mg daily) perpetually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. Some nascent studies suggest a low dose might act as an anti-aging pill by remodulating the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. If considering this, regular monitoring of lipid profiles and liver function by a doctor is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>.

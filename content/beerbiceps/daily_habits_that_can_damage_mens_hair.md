As men, it's important to keep hair in peak condition while it's still present, as balding is a common occurrence later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Certain daily habits can significantly harm hair quality. This article outlines ten common issues and their solutions to maintain healthy hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## 1. Using Incorrect Shampoo

**Problem**: Many shampoos contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate (SLS), a harsh chemical that acts like a detergent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While effective in [[hair_care_routine_to_prevent_dandruff | anti-dandruff shampoos]], frequent use can be damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

**Solution**:
*   Use SLS-containing shampoos, such as [[hair_care_routine_to_prevent_dandruff | anti-dandruff shampoos]], only once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   For other washes, opt for milder shampoos containing Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), also known as Sodium Laurel Ether Sulfate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The best option, if affordable, is to use sulfate-free shampoos regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   A budget-friendly approach involves using SLES-based shampoos often and SLS-based shampoos once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## 2. Excessive Hair Product Use

**Problem**: Hair products are chemicals not naturally present in hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Overuse can lead to hair loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

**Solution**:
*   Use hair products only occasionally, such as once every two weeks or once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Always wash them off thoroughly after use: first with water, then apply a little oil, followed by shampooing and conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Ensure all product is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## 3. Prolonged Exposure to Harsh Sunlight

**Problem**: While sunlight provides Vitamin D, harsh UV rays can damage hair and scalp, destroying epithelial cells essential for hair growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is part of the [[impact_of_external_elements_like_sun_and_pollution_on_hair | impact of external elements on hair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

**Solution**: Avoid prolonged exposure to harsh sunlight to protect hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## 4. Neglecting Sweat and Chlorine

**Problem**: Sweat washes off natural scalp oils and leaves behind salt and protein residue that can dry out hair and scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Chlorine from swimming pools also negatively impacts hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

**Solution**:
*   After intense cardio or heavy sweating, wash hair with shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   Ideally, schedule shampooing on the same days as cardio sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Always wash hair thoroughly immediately after swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## 5. Using Heavy Hair Products in Polluted Environments

**Problem**: Living in cities means unavoidable exposure to pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Heavy hair products like gels and waxes can trap pollution, affecting hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is another aspect of the [[impact_of_external_elements_like_sun_and_pollution_on_hair | impact of external elements on hair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

**Solution**:
*   Choose lighter hair products such as serums or organic hair creams made with natural ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   These lighter products can also help protect hair from pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## 6. Over-Shampooing

**Problem**: While washing hair with shampoo is important for a [[mens_hair_care_routine | mens hair care routine]], doing it every day can strip hair of its natural moisture and oils, which are vital for hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

**Solution**: Give hair a break from shampoo once in a while, maybe one or two days in a row, by washing it only with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This allows the scalp to produce natural oils and retain moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## 7. Frequent Blow Drying

**Problem**: Blow drying, similar to harsh shampoos, aggressively removes moisture and oils from hair and scalp, leading to damage and breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

**Solution**: Use blow dryers infrequently, ideally once every two weeks or once a month, to prevent hair damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## 8. Chemical and Heat Hair Procedures

**Problem**: Chemical procedures like hair coloring or dying destroy the hair's outer cuticle, allowing color to seep in, but damaging the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Hair straightening procedures, whether at a salon or home, use heat that also strips natural moisture and destroys oils, spoiling long-term hair quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

**Solution**: Embrace your natural hair color and avoid chemical or heat-based hair alteration procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## 9. Poor Diet and Lifestyle Choices

**Problem**: Diet and lifestyle significantly affect hair health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Smoking, in particular, introduces toxins that harm hair follicles and roots, promotes aging, and negatively impacts hair and scalp health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This relates directly to the [[effects_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_hair_quality | effects of diet and lifestyle on hair quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

**Solution**:
*   **Hydration**: Ensure adequate water intake, aiming for clear urine to stay hydrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Protein**: Consume at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Antioxidants**: Prioritize vegetables for antioxidants and nutrients over fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Avoid Smoking**: Stay away from smoking, as it damages not only lungs but the entire body, including hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## 10. Stress and Anxiety

**Problem**: Stress and anxiety elevate cortisol levels, a stress hormone that accelerates the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This severely affects skin and hair quality and can lead to hair loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is a key factor in [[managing_stress_and_its_relationship_with_hair_health | managing stress and its relationship with hair health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

**Solution**: The most effective solution for chronic stress and anxiety is regular, consistent meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

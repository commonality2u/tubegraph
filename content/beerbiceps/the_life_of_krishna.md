Shri Krishna is a favorite topic for discussion, recognized as a profoundly significant historical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He is considered a "Yuga Purush," or a revolutionary in everything he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>. The Mahabharata epic is described as the "longest epic of humanity," eight times the volume of the combined Iliad and Odyssey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:06">[09:06:06]</a>. Krishna is a key character within this epic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:02">[08:59:02]</a>.

## Historical Biography of Krishna

### Lifespan and Key Dates
Shri Krishna is believed to have lived for 107 or 108 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. According to calculations, his birth year was 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">[03:00:06]</a>, and he passed away in 5525 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>, making his lifespan 108 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. This aligns with a verse from Madhvacharya's *Sri Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya*, which states Krishna lived for 107 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He is believed to have been the same age as Arjuna, who also lived for almost 108 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]] war would have been fought when they were in their early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna | Birth and Childhood]]
Shri Krishna was born right after spring, in the early part of the summer season (Grishma Rutu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. His birth took place around June 27-28, 5633 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. He was born in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, and his uncle Kansa intended to kill him due to a prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Vasudeva, his father, took him from Mathura to Vrindavan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Notably, one does not have to cross the Yamuna River to get from Mathura to Vrindavan; Vasudeva simply walked along the riverbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Accounts of heavy rain during his escape are considered interpolations, as the Shravan month in 6th millennium BCE had no rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Harivamsa, an appendix to the Mahabharata, describes Vasudeva walking on dry cow dung and seeing cut tree branches piled up for agriculture, indicating a dry season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Krishna was raised in Vrindavan until he was 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, at which point he returned to Mathura and killed Kansa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Relocation to Dwarka
After killing Kansa, Krishna reinstated Kansa's father, Ugrasena, as king of Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Krishna later moved from central India to the west coast, to Dwarka, re-establishing a kingdom there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This move was strategic: Mathura's trade routes via the Yamuna and Ganga rivers were subject to tolls and conflict with Jarasandha's kingdom of Patna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Jarasandha defeated Krishna and the Yadus 17 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Krishna ultimately decided it was not worth fighting and moved to his ancestral land, Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Dwarka, originally known as Kusasthali, was a very prosperous island kingdom with bridges to the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Role in the Mahabharata]]
Krishna is a key character in the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]], which is the longest epic in humanity's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:06">[09:06:06]</a>. He first met the Pandava brothers, who are his cousins through their mother Kunti, when they were 33 years old, at Draupadi's swayamvar (self-choice marriage ceremony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Krishna served as a strategic statecraft character for the Pandavas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Despite his late entry into the Pandavas' story, he was crucial to the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]] war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He was 70 or 71 years old during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### [[final_days_of_krishnas_life | Final Days and the Destruction of Dwarka]]
Krishna returned to Dwarka after the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]] war. 36 years later, in 5525 BCE, Krishna passed away, and Dwarka was simultaneously flooded and destroyed by rising sea waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This catastrophic event is detailed in the Mahabharata text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Evidence for Krishna's Existence

Nilesh Oak emphasizes that there is much more evidence for Krishna, who lived over 7,500 years ago, compared to world personalities known from less than 2,000 years ago, like Jesus Christ or Alexander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Celestial Evidence
Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Harivamsa, contain precise astronomical descriptions that can be simulated with modern software (like Voyager 4.5) to pinpoint exact historical dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. One significant celestial event mentioned in Harivamsa (Vishnu Parva 23, Chapter 23) is a comet (`Ketu`) spanning 13 `nakshatras` (half the visible sky), so bright that "the moon has lost its path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This rare event, combined with other celestial alignments like Mercury's position on the western horizon and a total solar eclipse, precisely dates to March 22, 5622 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This is the year Krishna killed Kansa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Terrestrial Evidence
Archaeological evidence supports the dates derived from celestial observations. For example, the description in Harivamsa of Vasudeva's journey from Mathura to Vrindavan, where he saw dry cow dung and tree branches piled for agriculture, matches the lack of rain in the Shravan month during that ancient period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This contradicts later interpolations about heavy rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Krishna as a [[Vishnu and His Avatars | Vishnu Avatar]] and Guru

### The Concept of Avatars
Krishna is widely revered as the eighth [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Avatar of Vishnu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. In Hinduism, [[vishnu_and_his_avatars | Vishnu]] is the sustainer of the universe, taking part in world affairs to restore balance and sustain humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. While common understanding recognizes 10 avatars, the *Bhagavata Purana* lists 18 or 20, demonstrating the flexible nature of the avatar concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The speaker explains that avatars are continuously taking place, but figures like Rama and Krishna are considered "more special," akin to sacred places along the holy river Ganga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### [[krishnas_teachings_and_philosophy | Teachings and Philosophy]]
Krishna's teachings, particularly the [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavad Gita]], are considered a life manual for everyday problems, psychology, and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavad Gita]] was recited by Krishna to Arjuna before the [[krishna_in_the_mahabharata | Mahabharata]] war when Arjuna faced a moral dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

A unique aspect of Krishna's philosophy is "Murari," suggesting a third path not taken, a synthesis of different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He describes four types of `bhakta` (devotees), but emphasizes that the `gyani` (one who synthesizes knowledge and devotion) is most beloved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Krishna's advice often involves `quadrangulation` â€“ a four-part validation process:
1.  **Atma Pratiti**: One's own effort and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Apta Pratiti**: Validation from a trusted source, like Madhvacharya's corroboration of Krishna's age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
3.  **Shastra Pratiti**: Validation from sacred texts (Shastras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
4.  **Science Validation**: Using modern science to validate statements from the texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

Krishna is referred to as "Jagat Guru," meaning "guru of the world," because his teachings in the Bhagavad Gita are studied globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The term also implies "the person who takes the world as his Guru," as Krishna himself learned from many teachers, including Sandipani and Gor Angirasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. He even took `Shakti Diksha` from Shiva, demonstrating his open-mindedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Dispelling Misconceptions

The historical context challenges popular visualizations of the Mahabharata. Bhishma, for instance, was over 140 years old when he fought for the first ten days of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The longevity of figures in ancient texts is comparable to those in the Old Testament, suggesting that objections to such ages often stem from a lack of reading rather than factual impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Additionally, the common depiction of Bhima as intellectually inferior is refuted; he is shown to anticipate Krishna's advice months in advance, demonstrating significant intellect and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Regarding `Rakshasas` like Hidimba and her cannibalistic brother Hidimb, it is suggested that these were individuals or tribes with "bad habits" like cannibalism, rather than purely demonic beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Evidence of cannibalistic tribes exists even in recent history, such as Idi Amin in Uganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Krishna was a real person, who lived on Earth 7,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. His detailed life and intellectual biography solidify his status as a "Yuga Purush" and "Jagat Guru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The depth of evidence for his life, including celestial and terrestrial validation, positions him as a crucial figure in understanding ancient Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

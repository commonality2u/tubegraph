Dr. Savio Fado, a demonologist and psychic, explains the concepts of [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychometry]] and telepathic communication in the context of paranormal research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He is part of a team that conducts [[paranormal_investigation_methods | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> and research with a scientific method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Psychometry
[[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | Psychometry]] is described as the ability to "read" objects and surfaces through touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Dr. Fado explains that this ability stems from the nerve endings in the human body, allowing individuals to gain information from the surfaces they interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. He uses [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychometry]] to read rocks, trees, and other elements at a location, receiving answers that he then corroborates with facts, evidence, and historical information about the place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. He also teaches this technique to others attending ghost encounter sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

### Applications of Psychometry
*   **Investigative Scouting:** Dr. Fado employs [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychometry]] during scouting missions for [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This helps him determine if a location is worthy of investigation and what might be unearthed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Uncovering History:** By touching surfaces, Dr. Fado can sense the density or history of a place or object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. This was demonstrated in an investigation in Alibag, where he and Puja, another psychic, simultaneously sensed the presence of entities below ground and a tunnel system by interacting with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This was later confirmed by a local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **Crime Solving (Future Potential):** Dr. Fado believes that documenting these [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychometric]] experiences could lead to technological advancements, such as inventing a laser that could scan a wall and "read" past events, thereby helping solve crime cases without relying on potentially hostile witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

## Telepathic Communication
Telepathic communication, or "soft telepathy," is a skill Dr. Fado understood as part of his journey in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. He emphasizes that true NLP is about programming the brain for non-verbal communication, rather than just affirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

### Interaction with Entities
Dr. Fado communicates with entities telepathically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:33:00">[58:33:00]</a>. He explains that ghosts, lacking a physical body, cannot see or hear verbally, so telepathy, which manipulates vibrations and frequencies, becomes the mode of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:45:00">[58:45:00]</a>. He projects his thoughts out loud, using mediums like air, light, water, or even fire to transmit his communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:50:00">[59:50:00]</a>.

## Development of Abilities
Dr. Fado describes his psychic abilities as developing slowly and steadily over time, rather than being innate from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. He started with handwriting analysis, then moved to face reading, behavior analysis, and body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. His interest in understanding humans, coupled with learning hypnosis and NLP, led him to realize there was "something more" to sensing and reading people, objects, and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. He believes that humanity has more than the commonly known five senses, possessing at least 27 to 29 senses, including intuition, hunger, and balance, which are not yet fully explored by conventional science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Skepticism and Belief
Despite his abilities, Dr. Fado maintains a skeptical approach, questioning everything that happens in his investigations and exorcisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. He doesn't readily believe claims of possession or haunting without thorough examination and corroboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. He emphasizes that [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | paranormal research]] is still in a "gray shaded area" with believers and [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | skeptics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. His aim is to advance human understanding of these phenomena by looking at them from a pragmatic and scientific perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. He believes that spirituality is the science of the paranormal, suggesting a deeper scientific basis for these phenomena that modern science has yet to discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

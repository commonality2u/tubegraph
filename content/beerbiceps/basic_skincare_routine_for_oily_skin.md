The core of a good grooming routine focuses on neatness and cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Daily Face Cleansing

A fundamental step in [[face_washing_routine_and_products | basic face cleansing]] for oily skin is using a mild face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This product helps to eliminate oil, which, if accumulated, can lead to an increase in pimples and acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Recommended Routine
*   **Frequency**: Wash your face twice daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Once in the morning, right after waking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Once at night, one to two hours before bedtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Application**: Rub the face wash deep into your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Rinsing**: Rinse off with tepid (room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This [[face_washing_routine_and_products | daily routine]] is effective in preventing and minimizing acne by getting rid of excess oil and sebum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Young men, especially those in their teens or early twenties and individuals who frequent the gym, are more susceptible to acne, making this step crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Occasional Skincare Routine for Oily Skin

For special occasions like an important office meeting or a party where you want to look extra neat and avoid appearing oily, a bonus skincare routine can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Considerations for Oily Skin
*   **Moisturizer**: If you have oily skin, using moisturizer daily is not always recommended, as it can block pores and contribute to more acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   For occasional use, a basic moisturizer can rehydrate the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Powder**: Baby powder is preferred over regular talcum powder because it has very fine granules that are less likely to block pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Use sparingly, as too much baby powder can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   If too much is applied, it can be wiped down with a slightly wet cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

This occasional [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | skincare routine]] provides a subtle difference in how oily the skin appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. It's the closest thing to makeup for men who wish to look "metrosexual" without fully committing to conventional makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Remember that a skincare routine, like fitness, requires personalization to figure out what works best for your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Ronnie Coleman's legendary [[ronnie_colemans_bodybuilding_journey_and_achievements | bodybuilding journey and achievements]] as an eight-time Mr. Olympia champion were significantly shaped by various supporting factors and influences, ranging from his family to his athletic background and professional guidance.

Ronnie Coleman emphasizes that he has never experienced a truly lonely phase in his life due to his family's constant presence and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:02">[06:04:02]</a>. His family moved to Texas to be with him once he established himself after graduating college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:20">[06:30:20]</a>. This close-knit relationship provided a "wonderful experience" throughout his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:06">[06:53:06]</a>.

During his bodybuilding career, his family played an integral role:
*   His entire family, including his mom, brother, and sister, attended his first contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:12">[07:29:12]</a>. They even traveled to other countries to watch him compete and were always present when he won the Olympia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   His mother cooked all six of his daily meals during his peak competition years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   His brother assisted with car-related matters, and his sister helped with housework and laundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This collective effort meant "everybody pretty much in the family had a job and they all helped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, contributing to his eight consecutive Olympia wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   His mother's greatest lesson was to pursue goals with joy and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   He states he never went to a psychologist or psychiatrist because he "had the whole family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

## Athletic Background and Training Philosophy

Coleman's earlier [[the_impact_of_sports_and_cricket_on_personal_development_and_cultural_significant | impact of sports]] and commitment provided a foundational edge:
*   He started powerlifting around 14 or 15 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a> and didn't achieve his 800lb deadlift until he was nearly 38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   His powerlifting background, which includes deadlift, squat, and bench press, meant his deadlifting and squatting strength were always similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   He played various sports growing up, including football, track, baseball, and basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, and was a middle linebacker in football, acting as the "captain of the defense" calling out plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This athletic background helped with his powerlifting, which in turn aided his bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   He believes modern bodybuilders need to lift heavier to gain size, definition, and thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. His "tactical edge" was doing heavy lifts that other bodybuilders "wouldn't do" or "probably couldn't do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   Coleman consistently stretched every night for 20-30 minutes, a habit he developed from football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. He attributes his ability to do splits on stage, even at 330 lbs, to this flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Mental Fortitude and Faith

Coleman possesses a strong mindset and unwavering faith:
*   He maintains an "even-keeled and so humble" demeanor, enjoying the love and support without letting it get to his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   His commitment and ability to train "even harder" after winning were crucial to his continued success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He would go to the gym "with an attitude," determined that no one would take his title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   He describes himself as "so determined, so focused, so motivated, so dedicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Visualization played a significant role in his training, as he would mentally complete lifts like his 800lb squat a million times before physically attempting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   His "faith was always real strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He believes things happen for a reason and that "bad things are going to happen to good people" as a cycle of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   He prays multiple times a day for good health and happiness, which he believes he receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.
*   Despite challenges and injuries, he has never had a "sad phase" in his life, always finding ways to be happy and joyous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He believes "happiness is a choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Professional Guidance and Genetics

Professional insights and natural advantages were also vital:
*   His nutritionist helped him understand the critical role of eating large quantities of food to gain size, a concept he didn't fully grasp until winning his first Olympia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He learned he had to "stuff yourself" with six meals a day, including a pound of chicken per meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   He received information about steroid use from Flex Wheeler, who was "quite honest" and provided effective guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   His steroid use was doctor-prescribed, with regular check-ups every four months to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. He prioritized safety, stating he did not take "massive amounts" and was "so afraid to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   Coleman firmly believes that genetics play a 100% role in bodybuilding; "if God don't give it to you, you ain't going to get it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. His own genetic gifts included both size and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Continuous Learning

Coleman advocates for continuous learning and seeking multiple sources of knowledge:
*   His advice for young bodybuilders is to acquire "knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, as he initially knew "nothing" about proper diet or supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   He went through multiple coaches and learned as much as he could from each, suggesting that one should "have as many [coaches] as it takes to get you to the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This comprehensive approach covers diet, training, recovery, and "everything it takes to be a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

The journey of the soul is intricately linked to [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]], destined paths, and the continuous cycle of rebirth. This perspective highlights that the current lifetime is not our first, with individuals, on average, having lived approximately 500 lifetimes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## The Soul's Blueprint and Purpose
Before birth, every soul designs a "master plan" or "blueprint" in an energetic language, outlining their journey, lessons to learn, and connections to make. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> Intuition is described as the voice of the soul, constantly guiding individuals back to their predetermined path, as societal influences, parental upbringing, traumas, and the pressures of life often distract the human mind from its core purpose. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>

## Understanding Karmic Concepts
The totality of a soul's experiences across all lifetimes is stored in an "akashic record." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a> This record guides the soul in evaluating its past and planning for future growth and Ascension. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>

Akashic records can be broken down into three main components:
*   **[[karma_and_karmic_contracts | Karmic Contracts]]**: These are symbiotic relationships with individuals like parents, partners, colleagues, or friends, where souls contribute to and receive from each other's lives. These connections can be eternal, with individuals reconnecting across lifetimes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>
*   **[[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | Karmic Lessons]]**: These relationships are often short-lived and serve to teach specific lessons. If a lesson is not learned, it will be presented again, often in a harsher manner, until it is mastered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a> Repeated patterns in life, such as attracting abusive partners or toxic bosses, are indicators of unlearned [[lessons_from_experiences_and_importance_of_learning | karmic lessons]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>
*   **Karmic Incompletions**: These are tasks or purposes left unfinished in previous lifetimes that the soul chooses to complete in the current one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>

## The Nature of Karma
[[the_role_of_karma_and_dharma_in_shaping_ones_life | Karma]] is an immutable part of nature; it cannot be changed but can be balanced or released. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>
*   **Balancing Karma**: Involves directly repaying what was done, often with the same person involved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>
*   **Releasing Karma**: Involves experiencing a similar emotional outcome in a different situation, where the universal energy ensures the balance is achieved, even if not directly with the original parties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>

## Destiny and Free Will
[[the_role_of_karma_free_will_and_destiny_in_spiritual_life | Destiny]] is not predestined in its entirety; it is a combination of [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karma]] and the choices made through free will. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a> Humans have a choice to navigate their predetermined paths.

## Life, Death, and Reincarnation
Every soul is granted five "exit points" or periods when they can choose to depart from their human life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a> If a soul chooses to bypass an exit point, the intensity of their sufferings and challenges in life increases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a> This is akin to accepting more "homework" from a boss if one chooses to stay late at work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:58">[01:37:58]</a>

Souls of high vibrational frequency have the choice to [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | Incarnate]] or not. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a> However, souls of low vibrational frequencies often do not have this choice and are sent back to Earth to learn and grow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a> The "worst form of sin" for a soul, such as taking one's own life, can lead to it being stuck in the astral realm for extended periods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a> These stuck souls experience suffering, being neither fully in the physical nor spiritual world, unable to be heard or seen by others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>

## Growth Across Lifetimes
In Hinduism, [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth | Enlightenment]] is described as reaching the highest potential to break free from the cycle of human suffering, which is often seen as a punishment for incomplete [[karma_and_karmic_contracts | karmas]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a> Individuals return to address their weaknesses and master lessons across all dimensions of their being to achieve enlightenment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a> Ascended masters, such as those referenced in the [[bhagavad_gita_and_life_lessons | Bhagavad Gita]], continue to reincarnate to learn different lessons and fulfill varied purposes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a> Once a lesson is mastered, the soul does not need to relive that particular experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>

Individuals can also be reborn as animals, though this is generally seen as a "demotion" in the spiritual realm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a> There's a hierarchy, with dogs considered the last animal life before human, and cats being highly intuitive and absorbing negative energy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a> Animals, especially dogs, often become a reflection of their owners due to their absorbent nature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:46">[02:12:46]</a>

National policies are significantly shaped by the global geopolitical landscape, requiring leaders to navigate through various external pressures and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Navigating Global Shocks and Economic Stability

A country's leadership must constantly contend with unforeseen global events that impact national policies. For instance, the Prime Minister's role involves steering the nation through "very stormy waters" caused by global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war, and brewing global financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Despite these disruptions, the focus on core national goals, like building physical infrastructure, remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

The strength of a nation's economy is directly linked to its [[Geopolitics and global conflicts | geopolitical power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. However, an economy overly reliant on a single natural resource faces [[Geopolitics and foreign policy | geopolitical risks]], as larger powers may take "inordinate interest" in its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. Therefore, a robust economy needs to be "much more widely based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, fostering diverse sectors like services, industry, mining, construction, and farming for a "healthy ecological system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.

## Influence of International Organizations and Narratives

International organizations can deliberately manipulate narratives through studies and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. These bodies often attempt to dictate national actions and decision-making by imposing specific norms and standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.

### [[Soft power and media influence | Soft Power]] and Algorithmic Control
The influence extends to [[Soft power and media influence | soft power]] mechanisms, such as algorithms and media narratives. Algorithms, often perceived as objective, can be swayed or trained to promote particular viewpoints, creating a "managed algorithm that is being used to manipulate you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This poses a significant [[Technologys impact on geopolitics | geopolitical weapon]], as foreign companies owning powerful algorithms (like AI bots) can shape global narratives and opinions, even impacting a nation's perceived democratic standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

**Example of Algorithmic Influence:**
Wikipedia, though widely used for basic information, is edited by ideologically tilted groups who can continuously tamper with entries, affecting the perceived objective truth of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. Similarly, an AI trained on biased sources could present skewed information, creating "completely alternative reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

### Imposition of Global Norms
Another subtle form of [[Geopolitics and global conflicts | geopolitical influence]] is the imposition of norms like Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. While appearing beneficial, these subjective norms can be used by external entities, such as ESG rating companies or Western think tanks (e.g., V-Dem, Freedom House, Chatham House), to create "global narrative" and dictate decision-making processes for businesses and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

::warning
**Case Study: Rating Bias**
Organizations like V-Dem have rated India, the world's largest democracy, significantly lower than expected (108 out of 140 countries, just above Pakistan), and below Afghanistan in academic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This demonstrates how external indices can be systematically influenced to present a negative picture, impacting a country's global standing and the perceptions of its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

This kind of manipulation, stemming from powerful external interests like George Soros who has historically used his wealth to affect narratives and potentially "regime change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>, represents a new form of "colonization" that nations must actively resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.

## Response to External Influences
A country's national policies must account for these external influences. Instead of being afraid, nations need to "engage with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>, push back against biased narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, and adapt to competitive global environments for areas like startup ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. This requires not only economic growth but also systemic reforms within the legal and administrative systems to create a more resilient and self-reliant nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

Success, alongside money and fame, is determined by two key factors: the ability to work hard and possessing the correct career mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Before entering the professional world, it is vital to improve one's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Teenage Lessons for Success

The following three lessons are highlighted as being profoundly helpful in life, particularly for teenagers building their mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### 1. Using Adversity for Growth

Individuals who mock, doubt, or cause emotional pain can actually contribute to one's growth in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Criticism, such as about one's weight, can be transformed into [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | motivation]], while doubts about one's potential can serve as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Your future is solely in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Feeling inferior in the present is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, as life is a continuous process of [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | self-improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The choice lies in either dwelling on negative situations and people or choosing to grow in every aspect and become the best version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### 2. Self-Acceptance and Managing Flaws

One's perceived flaws, whether physical like acne or body fat, are often much smaller than one imagines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The reality is that no one is perfect, and individuals tend to notice their own imperfections more than others do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In a world characterized by fakeness and insecurity, it is crucial to cultivate [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | self-love]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Some personal characteristics, such as hair, skin color, or nose shape, are unchangeable, and these should be loved as they define who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For aspects that can be altered, such as clothing choices or other external appearance factors, effort should be made to learn and improve them with correct knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This process is part of transitioning from childhood to adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Developing external confidence can lead to internal confidence, which in turn fosters internal happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### 3. Marks Do Not Define Your Future

A significant teenage life lesson is to never let academic marks define you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While society often suggests that marks dictate future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, they primarily influence only the initial chapters of a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Five to ten years into a career, employers will prioritize an individual's proficiency, character, and the [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | passion]] they invest in their work, rather than their college or specific scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Pressure from parents and teachers regarding marks is often a protective measure for their own reputations or a form of [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Scoring poorly is merely a minor event in the grand timeline of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Your marks do not determine your future; instead, the "hustle" and effort applied throughout the rest of your life do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## The Three-Point Formula for Success

The formula for success in life is based on three principles:
1.  Love people and love your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
2.  Practice gratitude for everything the world offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
3.  Focus on happiness and the positive aspects of your situation, life, and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This mindset encourages continuous effort towards becoming the best version of oneself and embracing who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Recognizing your inherent worth is key to [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | self-belief]] and achieving [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | ambition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The term "mythology" often causes offense among many Indians who view their ancient texts and traditions, such as the Ramayan, Mahabharat, Vishnu Puran, and Shiv Puran, as integral parts of their history and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some categorize these stories as mythology, there's a strong preference to consider them as [[Cultural and historical significance of ancient Indian scriptures|Indian history and culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. There is a perceived lack of knowledge about these subjects among both the youth and older generations in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Reclaiming Lost Knowledge and Understanding

Ancient India, particularly around 1 BC or 2 BC, is believed to have been significantly more knowledgeable than it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. However, much of this [[Lost history and archeological mysteries of ancient India|historical knowledge]] was lost or destroyed due to centuries of invasions, with prominent examples like the burning of Nalanda University for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This has created a significant disconnect between the rich civilizational knowledge of the past and contemporary societal awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Despite this, a renewed interest in ancient Indian history and culture is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### The Scientific Outlook in Ancient Texts

Understanding ancient Indian narratives requires an open mind, focusing on the lessons and knowledge they impart rather than solely on their historical veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Approaching these texts with an open mind aligns with scientific inquiry, which encourages questioning everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The Rig Veda, a foundational Indian scripture, champions the beauty of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. [[Science and religion in Indian culture|Indian religion]], particularly the Upanishads and Vedas, is rooted in curiosity, urging individuals to explore the world, themselves, and the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This quest for knowledge is seen as the very birth of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

Indeed, many advanced astrophysicists and scientists eventually gravitate towards Vedanta, finding striking parallels between complex mathematical and physical concepts and those articulated in the Vedas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. This suggests that ancient Indian culture may have already explored and documented higher levels of mathematics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Advanced Concepts in Ancient Indian Texts

Ancient Indian scriptures delve into various "science fiction" or [[Ancient scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures|scientific aspects]], including references to advanced technologies, cosmic entities, and complex timelines.

### Aliens and Vimanas

The concept of "aliens" or other intelligent life forms is embedded in ancient Indian lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Texts like the Shrimat Bhagwat Puran describe a multi-layered universe with 14 *lokas* (planes of existence): Earth (*Madya Loka*) and 13 other *lokas* (seven lower and six higher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. The inhabitants of these other *lokas* would, by definition, be considered aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:12]</a>. Both divine beings (devas) and antagonistic beings (asuras) are depicted as possessing advanced technology, including divine weapons akin to modern WMDs and **vimanas** (flying machines or spaceships) used for inter-loka travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

One prominent example is the story of **Tripurasura**, who had three floating cities, described as either spaceships or satellites, which were indestructible unless aligned in a single line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:12]</a>. Lord [[Mythology and stories of Shiva and Bhairava|Shiva]] destroyed these cities with a divine weapon (*Narayan Astra*) during this rare alignment, an event celebrated as **Dev Deepavali** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. This narrative can be interpreted as an account of [[Ancient scientific knowledge in Hindu scriptures|intergalactic wars]] between different groups of advanced, non-Earthly beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

Vimanas are mentioned in various texts, such as the *Pushpak Vimana* used by Ravana (originally belonging to Kubera) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:48:00">[57:48:00]</a>, and flying machines used in the Mahabharata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>. These machines were often designed or provided by advanced civilizations, such as Vishwakarma (architect of the devas) or Mayadanav (architect of the asuras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. Some texts, like the *Vaimanika Shastra*, even describe different types and shapes of planes, with some modern experiments confirming their aerodynamic stability, though the propulsion technology (e.g., Mercury Vortex) remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

### Cosmology and Divine Hierarchy

The hierarchy of gods in Hindu texts can be confusing, as different Puranas emphasize different deities as supreme (e.g., Shiva in Shiv Puran, Vishnu in Vaishnav Puran, Krishna in Bhagwatam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This variation is explained by the concept of **kalpas**, which are different time periods or cycles of creation within a larger cosmic timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Each *kalpa* witnesses different creation events and avatar appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. For instance, the Vishnu Puran is specifically relevant to the current *Vaha Kalpa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

The Rig Veda's *Purush Sukta* introduces the *Adi Purush* (primordial being) from whom all creation emanates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The Shiv Puran, conversely, describes Shiva as emerging as a giant pillar of fire (*Shivalingam*) before Brahma and Vishnu, asserting his supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. However, the fundamental "Holy Trinity" (Trimurti) in Hinduism remains Brahma (creator), Vishnu (preserver), and Mahesh (Shiva, destroyer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Ancient scriptures also posit the existence of a **Multiverse**, with millions of universes emanating from the pores of the *Karana-dakshayi Vishnu* with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The lifespan of Brahma, the creator deity for our universe, is described as approximately 311 trillion human years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This cosmic vision, found in the Puranas, is extraordinarily grand, suggesting a vast and interconnected reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### The Soma Plant

The **Soma plant**, heavily referenced in the ninth *Mandala* of the Rig Veda, is a subject of much debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. While some interpret it as a psychedelic mushroom (linking it to the cognitive revolution theories of Graham Hancock), descriptions in the Rig Veda suggest it was an invigorating substance, possibly triggering an adrenaline rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. It was extracted from stalks, mixed with milk or curd, and consumed by gods like Indra before battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The exact botanical identity of Soma is lost, but ancient Persian (Parsi/Zoroastrian) traditions still perform a "Homa" ceremony involving a similar plant from Afghanistan, which was historically imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This highlights a shared cultural root with Iranians, who were often antagonists of Vedic people, with "asuras" being demons in Vedic texts but revered beings in Zoroastrianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Ancient Climate and Lost Civilizations

The concept of "Ice Ages" and their impact on ancient civilizations is also discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Bal Gangadhar Tilak's *The Arctic Home of The Vedas* proposes that Vedic people may have lived in the Arctic region, citing descriptions of six-month-long days and nights and multiple dawns found in the Rig Veda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Before the Ice Age, the poles had a more temperate, habitable climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. As the Ice Age progressed, populations would have migrated southward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

The **Out of Africa theory** of human origins states that Homo sapiens emerged in East Africa and migrated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Genetic studies suggest that populations from East Africa entered India around 60,000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. These tropical populations are believed to have survived the Ice Age and subsequently populated other parts of the world, including Europe, Siberia, and the Americas (via the Bering Bridge, now Bering Strait) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. The resemblance between Native Americans and people from Japanese or Chinese races supports this migration theory, with the Americas being populated as recently as 14,000-15,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

During Ice Ages, sea levels drop as water freezes into ice sheets. When the ice melts, sea levels rise, inundating coastal civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This phenomenon explains the universal story of a **global deluge** found in nearly all world mythologies, from Mesopotamia and Sumeria to Native American and Philippine cultures, including the Indian story of Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. These "anti-diluvian" (before the flood) cultures, like ancient Indian civilization, would have seen their coastal cities submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

The *Matsya Avatar* (fish incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, where Vishnu warns Manu (the progenitor of mankind) about an impending global flood and instructs him to gather all plants, animals, and the *Saptarishis* (seven sages) to preserve knowledge, echoes the Noah's Ark narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This story, found in the Matsya Puran, highlights the importance of preserving knowledge to rebuild civilization after a catastrophic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Megafauna and Dinosaurs

Ancient Indian texts also describe mythical creatures that align with megafauna or even dinosaurs. The **Sharab**, for instance, is depicted as a chimeric being with limbs and features from multiple animals, considered the ultimate predator in the food chain capable of eating lions and tigers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. Scientifically, this description best fits a dinosaur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. Evidence of such knowledge appears in places like Angkor Wat, an 11th-century Hindu temple complex in Cambodia, which features a clear carving of a Stegosaurus on a temple wall, long before modern scientific discovery of dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

## Prophecies and the Return of the Messiah

[[Comparative mythology between Indian texts and other ancient cultures|Many world mythologies share common features]], such as the great deluge, the thunder god (e.g., Thor, Indra, Zeus), and the concept of the universal egg (Brahmanda) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Another shared concept is the return of a **Messiah** or savior figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. In Hinduism, this is the **Kalki Avatar**, who is prophesied to return at the end of the Kali Yuga to usher in a new Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>. Similar prophecies exist in Tibetan Buddhism (Kalki Kings, Maitreya Buddha) and Christianity (the coming back of the Messiah) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. This shared belief might stem from a common ancient prophecy, a collective human hope for a better future, or a psychological need for an external savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

The exploration of ancient Indian texts reveals a rich tapestry of knowledge encompassing cosmology, advanced technology, climate science, and shared human experiences. It prompts a rethinking of history, acknowledging the possibility of [[Controversial perspectives on Indian history|lost civilizations]] and scientific advancements that might have prioritized equilibrium with nature over material consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. The essence of Indian scriptures lies in encouraging curiosity and questioning, reflecting a profound scientific inquiry at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

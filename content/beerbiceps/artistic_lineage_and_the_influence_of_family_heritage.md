The conversation with Janhvi Kapoor delves into the multifaceted impact of [[parental_influence_and_support_in_career_choices | parental influence and support in career choices]] and family heritage on an individual's life and artistic path, particularly within the context of the film industry.

## Genetic Aspect of Artistry

It is posited that art might have a genetic component. Evolutionary psychologists and doctors studying DNA sequencing suggest that a part of artistic inclination may come from parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Specifically:
*   **Maternal Lineage (Mitochondria)**: Every woman can trace her mitochondria back through her mother's lineage, influencing energy levels, outlook on life, and proactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Paternal Lineage**: While less detailed, paternal lineage is believed to relate to personality and characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

This scientific perspective offers an argument for nepotism, suggesting that an internal drive for cinema and art can be inherited from an artistic family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Growing Up in a Film Family

Janhvi Kapoor's upbringing in a film family significantly shaped her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. She often skipped formal schooling, with her primary education taking place on her father's film sets or while traveling with her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This environment taught her invaluable lessons, such as:
*   Respecting people's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   Understanding different cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   Developing emotional intelligence, particularly understanding the sensitivity of artists in an artistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Parental Influence and Inherited Traits

Janhvi's parents, through their work and personal traits, deeply influenced her.

### From Her Father (Boney Kapoor)
Janhvi describes her father as a "hustler" and incredibly strong, noting that "nothing gets him down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Key aspects gained from him include:
*   **Work Ethic**: A strong belief in hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Process-Driven Approach**: Focusing on the process rather than being solely outcome-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Honesty**: Valuing honesty in work, dealing with people, and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **First-Generation Success**: Her father and uncles, Anil Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor, grew up in Chembur as the less affluent Kapoor family compared to the more affluent Kapoor family, which instilled a need to hustle more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This experience of building success from the ground up fostered a strong sense of reality and hard work within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Brotherhood**: The three brothers maintain a real and honest relationship, supporting each other despite misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This is described as "Punjabi Brotherhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### From Her Mother (Sridevi Kapoor)
Janhvi feels that people might perceive it as arrogant for her to draw parallels with her mother, Sridevi Kapoor, but notes that to her, Sridevi was simply "my mom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Inherited traits and characteristics include:
*   **Physicality**: She apparently walks, eats, and cries like her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Voice**: Her voice is very similar to Sridevi's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Personality**: Janhvi describes herself as needy and sensitive like her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **On-Camera Presence**: She's been told she can "switch on and switch off" in front of the camera, similar to her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Endearing Energy**: Her eyes are said to have the same endearing energy as Sridevi's, evident in films like *Mr. India* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This aligns with her being an empath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Dignity and Innocence**: Sridevi's life stood for dignity and innocence, remaining "a child" and "naive" even after many years in the industry. This sheltered and uncorrupted nature made her art pure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Janhvi hopes this inspires people to look for the best in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Navigating Nepotism and Identity

Janhvi openly discusses the [[challenges_and_pressures_faced_by_children_of_successful_parents | challenges and pressures faced by children of successful parents]], particularly the "nepotism debate" that has impacted her since school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Small remarks from teachers or peers suggested her success or friendships were due to her parents' fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This constant external validation questioning her own merit has led her to question what she has to offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

However, she prefers to be "under-confident" rather than "delusional" or arrogant about the attention she receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. She believes arrogance can lead to complacency and stagnation in one's art and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## [[importance_of_family_values_in_personal_and_professional_life | Importance of Family Values in Personal and Professional Life]]

Beyond inherited talent and career paths, the family's deep love for films and cinema drives them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. After losing her mother, Sridevi, Janhvi states that her own and her father's love for films, coupled with the family's love and support, has been a primary motivator to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This deep connection to their craft is almost "selfish" in its intensity, providing a vital source of life and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

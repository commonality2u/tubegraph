Ronnie Coleman's legendary career as an eight-time Mr. Olympia champion was built on a unique blend of physical prowess and a deeply ingrained [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | mental philosophy]] that prioritized commitment, intense training, and strategic visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. His approach to the sport, often described as the "hardest in the world," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a> transcended mere physical exertion, delving into the psychological aspects of peak performance.

## Commitment and Dedication
Coleman emphasizes that his unprecedented success stemmed from unwavering commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Winning one Olympia title meant only a day or two of celebration before shifting focus entirely to preparing for the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This constant state of readiness made his championship years "real dark times, real dark days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, as he was entirely consumed by the sport.

His life revolved around bodybuilding, eliminating typical social activities like going out to eat, movies, parties, or weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This intensive, 24/7, 365-day-a-year dedication was necessary because competitors were "working just as hard as you are" to take his title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This demonstrates a clear [[influence_of_discipline_and_preparation_in_career_success | influence of discipline and preparation in career success]].

## The "Attitude Edge" and Visualization
A crucial aspect of Coleman's training philosophy was his "attitude edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. He would approach the gym with an aggressive mindset, stating, "If they want to go to war, take them to war, and they ain't going to take this away from me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This competitive fire, combined with extreme focus, motivation, and dedication, allowed him to "persevere through just about anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This intense, almost martial, mental approach aligns with concepts found in [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | Special Forces mindset and mentality]].

Coleman heavily relied on visualization, often having "already done it before I did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. For example, he pictured himself squatting 800 lbs for two weeks leading up to the actual lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. He attributes this mental preparation as a key factor in his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. His only regret from the 800 lb squat was not visualizing more reps, as the weight felt "light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Training Philosophy: Heavy Lifting and Density
Coleman advocates for heavy lifting as the most effective way to gain "size, definition, and thickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. He believes that a very thick muscle appears bigger than it actually is, attributing his distinctive "density" to his heavy lifting style, something modern bodybuilders often lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. He was known for lifts like squatting and deadlifting 800 lbs, leg pressing 2,300 lbs, and bench pressing 500 lbs for reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He states that he did "stuff that other bodybuilders wouldn't do," or "probably couldn't do either" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

His powerlifting background, starting at age 14 or 15, laid the foundation for his bodybuilding strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. He found that his deadlift and squat capabilities were consistently similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Despite the heavy weights, Coleman never aimed to be "real strong," only when competing in powerlifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. His focus was always on the training itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. He trained with fixed rep ranges, typically 20, 15, 12, and 10 reps, taking each set to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. He also performed 100-rep sets occasionally, but purely "just for fun," not for bodybuilding gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Approach to Injuries and Pain
Coleman's approach to pain and injury was unique. He states he "never got sore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>, even when actively bodybuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. This contrasts with many younger individuals who view soreness as a sign of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>, highlighting the individual differences in bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. This perspective offers a different angle on [[mental_approach_to_muscle_soreness | mental approach to muscle soreness]].

Even when dealing with herniated discs, he continued to train, believing it helped rehabilitate and prevent his condition from worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. This unwavering commitment to training through discomfort showcases his extraordinary pain tolerance and mental fortitude. Despite multiple surgeries later in life, he maintains that his mind was never "psychologically affected" by the physical setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

## Mental Strength and Humility
Coleman describes himself as "real strong minded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>, able to rationalize difficult situations and maintain an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. His strong faith reinforced his belief that "things happen for a reason" and that violence is "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. This perspective, cultivated during his time as a police officer witnessing various crimes, contributed to his humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

He has consistently maintained a positive outlook, stating that nothing can "bring me down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a> and that he is one of the "luckiest guys in the whole wide world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a> due to his unique gifts. He believes that happiness is a choice and consciously chooses to be joyous, even when facing setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. His consistent positive demeanor throughout his career and life reflects a deep [[mental_health_and_lifestyle | mental health and lifestyle]] balance.

## The Role of Support Systems
Contrary to the stereotype that bodybuilding is a lonely sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, Coleman highlights the immense support he received from his family. His entire family attended his contests, even internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. They assisted with fan mail, and his mother cooked all his six meals a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This close-knit family environment significantly buffered any potential loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, illustrating the importance of [[balancing_fitness_and_personal_life | balancing fitness and personal life]] through support.

## Evolution of Philosophy
Coleman's philosophy has evolved with age. While he initially didn't feel "invincible" at his peak, he later realized he had an unparalleled physical capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. After his competitive career, he is now able to "sit back, relax and soak it all in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, enjoying the benefits of aging such as relaxation and time with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. He prays daily for good health and happiness, noting that he is "blessed" with both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.

For aspiring bodybuilders, his primary advice is to acquire "knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. This involves learning about diet, training, and recovery from multiple knowledgeable coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, emphasizing continuous learning and adaptation to become a champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.

This article explores various perspectives on ghosts and hauntings, drawing from [[indian_folklore_and_mythology_related_to_ghosts | Indian folklore and mythology related to ghosts]], [[personal_ghost_stories | personal ghost stories]], and the insights of [[paranormal_investigations and beliefs | paranormal investigators]] and horror writers. The discussion delves into the nature of spirits, their origins, and how humans interact with them.

## Types of Ghosts and Entities

The conversation highlights several supernatural entities, often rooted in [[indian_folklore_and_mythology_related_to_ghosts | Indian culture]]:

*   **Chudel and Dayaan** These entities share a similar origin theory: a woman who dies during childbirth or pregnancy and is not properly cremated with all rituals, turns into a Chudel due to "latent desire" in her mind [00:00:06]. An unsatisfied spirit, she is unable to witness the happiness of other women [00:00:25]. A Chudel is described as a type of witch or entity [00:13:07]. Dayaan are similar entities [00:13:53].
*   **Yakshin** These are demigoddesses believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven, called Alkapuri, governed by Kubera (Ravana's brother and protector of wealth) [00:11:37]. When they come to Earth, they are typically in evil forms, appearing beautiful and voluptuous to seduce men before revealing their true evil nature [00:00:39].
*   **Pishach (Ghoul)** This entity from Hindu mythology is believed to be created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger, possibly with unfulfilled revenge [00:10:33]. Unlike poltergeists, a Pishach can kill [00:11:21].
*   **Poltergeist** These are described as noisy ghosts, not typically evil, but mischievous and naughty. They attempt to disorient people and sap their energies, but "hardly kill" [00:11:00].
*   **Betal** This is a hanging ghost, sometimes formless, that attaches to trees, especially banyan or peepal trees, after a man dies with unfulfilled wishes [00:18:40]. They are believed to haunt passersby, travel to their homes, and create havoc in their lives [00:19:14].

## Nature of Ghosts and Hauntings

The prevailing view is that the realm of ghosts is "full of suffering" [00:05:35]. A common theory suggests that an "unnatural death" before one's destined time leads to the spirit remaining in this realm as a ghost for the remainder of its allotted time [00:05:46]. This idea is drawn from philosophical and spiritual books like the *Guran Autobiography of Yogi* [00:05:57].

While some ghosts are considered evil, particularly those who experienced violent deaths or have unfulfilled desires, the majority are believed to be good [00:09:50]. Evil ghosts often stem from "some kind of violence" either throughout their lives or in their death, leading to a state of anger or unfulfilled wishes [00:10:22].

## [[personal_ghost_stories | Personal Encounters]] and Beliefs

The host and guest, both horror writers, shared [[personal_ghost_stories | personal experiences]] with the supernatural, suggesting that those who write horror are often "believers" or have had childhood experiences with the [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | paranormal]] [00:03:08].

*   **Fear of the Dark and Catharsis** A strong childhood fear of the dark, where the host imagined a man dropping from the ceiling to grab him, later transformed into the art of creating horror content, serving as a "catharsis" to face those fears [00:04:16]. The guest also experienced similar childhood fears, which now manifest in his books to "scare other people" [00:05:20].
*   **Encounters While Writing** The guest recounted an experience in Goa while writing a horror novel. He felt something "cold pass by" behind him, followed by flickering lights in his room, which was material and not merely an illusion [00:09:08]. This led him to believe that spirits may come to know when someone is writing about their world [00:08:11].
*   **Dreams and Discomfort** Writing horror has also led to "weird dreams" and a general feeling of being "creeped out" [00:08:20]. The host expressed a morbid fear of dead bodies and discomfort when death occurs nearby, feeling pulled into an "unknown" world [00:22:57].

## [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | Paranormal Investigation]] and Countermeasures

[[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | Paranormal investigators]] strive to find the truth behind supernatural phenomena, though "no two paranormal investigators also will have the same theory for ghosts" [00:06:33].

*   **Rationalist vs. Spiritualist Views**
    *   **Jay Alani** is a rationalist who believes a significant portion of the [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | paranormal world]] in India is "Blind Faith and Superstition" or "commercially propagated" for quick profit [00:07:05]. He focuses on identifying the true [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | paranormal]] from the fake [00:07:39].
    *   **Sarbajit Roy** believes that "paranormal energies are all around us" and represent an "other dimension" that can see humans but cannot be interacted with by them [00:07:47].
*   **The Epicenter of Hauntings** Investigators often look for the "epicenter" of a haunting, which can sometimes be a human playing mischief or an object [00:20:33]. An example given is a "curio" (souvenir) that caused a man's terrible accident and loss of his wife because it was possessed by a spirit [00:20:45]. This is akin to the Warrens' museum of artifacts in *The Conjuring* series, which contains possessed objects like the Annabelle doll [00:21:23].
*   **Detection Tools** While science struggles to prove the existence of ghosts definitively, tools like **K2 meters** are used by investigators [00:24:26]. These devices detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) [00:24:30]. While a basic EMF is always present (one light blinking), a sudden spike (all five lights coming on in a remote area) can indicate a potential [[paranormal_activities and supernatural entities | ghostly entity]], though it is still an inference and not direct proof [00:24:56].
*   **Counteracting Dark Energies**
    *   **Mantras and Meditation** The host utilized mantra chanting and meditation to protect himself and recover from a [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | witchcraft experience]] [00:30:56]. Deep meditation is believed to foster fearlessness towards entities [00:22:38].
    *   **Salt Water Baths** A common practice believed to "wash off negative energy" [00:33:03].
    *   **Psychic Protection** A psychic friend would rub and clap his hands loudly to create a "protective field" and "send things away" in haunted areas [00:28:08].

## [[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | Cultural Perceptions]] of the Supernatural

[[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | Indian culture]] is described as rich in spiritual wisdom, but also with an "underbelly of spiritualism" that includes the "occult side of things" [00:17:47].

*   **Trees as Spirit Dwellings** There is a belief that trees can house spirits and act as a "safe heaven" for them [00:18:14]. People are warned not to urinate on trees, as a spirit might "possess you" [00:18:21], or not to walk under certain trees (like banyan or peepal) at night, as they are believed to house a Betal [00:18:35]. This is also related to the account of a cursed tree in a village in Bhubaneswar where young men were compelled to hang themselves, which paranormal investigators identified as a "huge mass of black energy" [00:14:40].
*   **Delhi as a Haunted City** Delhi is considered one of the most haunted places due to its age and history of battles, leaving behind "angst and pain" from the ghosts of people [00:27:46].
*   **Witchcraft and Its Dual Nature** [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | Witchcraft]] is acknowledged to have both positive and negative aspects [00:34:36].
    *   **Negative Witchcraft:** The host recounted a personal experience of being affected by a woman practicing [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena | witchcraft]], leading to dizziness and a strong feeling of needing to leave [00:31:39]. His psychic friend confirmed a "dark Aura" on him [00:32:28]. Black magic is sometimes associated with attempts to take something from others, such as "youth, money" [00:34:24].
    *   **Positive Witchcraft:** The village of Mayong in Assam is believed to be the "birthplace of black magic" where it is practiced for "healing" [00:34:51]. Tantrics and Ojas perform mantras to "cleanse" people spiritually [00:35:20].

## Science vs. Spirituality

The guest, having a background in organic chemistry, noted that while science seeks proof, the existence of another world, being "just energy," is hard to prove [00:23:54]. Although tools like K2 meters can detect anomalous EMF readings, they only provide "observed proof" and cannot definitively show what is causing the phenomenon [00:25:07]. The disconnect remains because humans "do not actually see ghost... with our eyes" [00:25:22]. Despite this, the host believes there is a "science behind this" and that scientific research has simply not yet invested enough time to understand these phenomena [00:37:35]. The conversation suggests that as technology advances (like recording dreams in Japan), the ability to understand these phenomena might change in the future [00:25:47].

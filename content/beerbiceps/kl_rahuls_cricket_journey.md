KL Rahul, a prominent Indian cricketer, shared insights into his life, career, and the unique pressures of growing up in the public eye during a conversation on "AIO presents The Ranvir Show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The host noted Rahul's humble demeanor, which Rahul attributes to his parents' early teachings, especially his mother's wish for him to be known as a humble person, regardless of his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Early Life and cricketing beginnings

Born in Mangalore, a small town without sporting heroes, Rahul reflected on the unlikely path that led him to the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. His parents initially wanted him to pursue traditional careers like engineering or medicine, but they were supportive when he chose cricket at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Cricket became his sole focus from the age of 11, leaving little time for school attendance (beyond exams) or developing other hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. He pursued cricket without a "Plan B," always dreaming of playing for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## The Journey to the Top

Rahul's career progressed step by step, from playing in Mangalore to Karnataka, facing intense competition for spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. His self-belief was crucial in navigating this lonely journey to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He recalled his first Test century, a moment he had visualized countless times, yet when it happened, he was "blank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Achieving financial stability later in his career, around 2018 at age 25-26, after experiencing [[overcoming_failure_in_cricket | ups and downs]], allowed him to fully focus on cricket and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## [[handling_pressure_and_fame_as_a_cricketer | Handling Pressure and Fame]]

Growing up in front of the world as a cricketer means every movement, action, and word is judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Rahul emphasized the constant pressure to maintain a certain image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He noted that while there's immense love and support from fans, especially the 90% who aggressively back the team, the negativity and trolling tend to stick in the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

Rahul shared advice from Ishant Sharma upon his debut in Australia: stay away from social media, whether performing well or not, to remain balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. Initially, he felt immune to criticism, driven to prove people wrong, but over time, he realized it did affect him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. Now, he tries to avoid reading about himself for mental peace and to focus on the right things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. He also highlighted the difficulty of being away from family guidance during formative years, relying instead on coaches and senior players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_mentors_in_cricket | Impact of Mentors and Team Dynamics]]

Rahul credits Rahul Dravid as his biggest cricket mentor, having grown up watching him and later training and playing alongside him in Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

He discussed the [[cricketing_environment_and_team_dynamics | current dressing room environment]], describing it as chilled, with loud music and players relaxing, as the pressure hits once they step onto the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. The team aims to maintain a "15 Bros chilling" atmosphere to detach from the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

Rahul has learned from several influential leaders:
*   **MS Dhoni**: From Dhoni, his first captain, Rahul learned the importance of building relationships with each player so they are willing to "fight for you on the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. He admired Dhoni's calm, balanced approach, his presence, and his ability to know what was happening with each individual personally and professionally, helping him get the best out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Dhoni's unique characteristic was his unwavering trust in his gut feeling, never second-guessing decisions, which often led to unorthodox yet successful outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: Kohli instilled passion and aggression, setting high standards and inspiring teammates to become better versions of themselves through focus on fitness and diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Rohit Sharma**: Rohit's sharp leadership, meticulous homework, and strategic understanding of opponents' strengths and flaws contribute to his relaxed demeanor on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## [[leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | Leadership and Captaincy Style]]

Having captained in the IPL and a few games for India, Rahul realized that a captain is only as good as his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. His initial approach was to be reserved, expecting players to know their roles, but he learned the necessity of building relationships and ensuring the entire team is on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

His philosophy for leadership is to remain true to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. He acknowledged that he initially tried to behave differently in a leadership role, but realized that being authentic empowers other players to be comfortable in their own skin, whether they are aggressive or quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Reflections on the Game

Rahul shared his personal views on fielding and wicket-keeping:
*   **Fielding**: He believes fielding is purely about practice and hard work, requiring no luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Dropping a catch is a bad feeling because it lets the team down and can cause a dip in energy for all 11 players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja's Fielding**: He describes Ravindra Jadeja as a "gifted athlete" with incredible speed and a great arm, whose presence on the field makes opponents hesitant to take chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Wicket-keeping**: He enjoys wicket-keeping as it keeps him engaged in every ball, regardless of the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The wicket-keeper has the best view of the pitch, conditions, and batsmen, allowing them to influence captain's strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Rahul expressed gratitude for the opportunity to share his experiences, noting that he enjoys talking about the deeper aspects of a cricketer's mind rather than just surface-level questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He emphasized that despite the internet's criticism, the true cricket fans understand and appreciate the players' dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. He concluded by reiterating his belief in God's plan and his immense pride in his journey from a small town to the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

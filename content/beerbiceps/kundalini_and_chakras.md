The spiritual journey involves understanding and activating various energetic centers within the human body, known as chakras. These centers are intricately linked to spiritual progress and the manifestation of different life experiences.

## Understanding Chakras

Chakras are described as energetic points within the body that, when active, influence various aspects of an individual's life and being. While there are more, six primary chakras are generally considered functional in most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

Each functional chakra is associated with different aspects:
*   A damaged chakra can manifest as pain, such as emotional trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>.
*   The Muladhara chakra's functioning can lead to acquiring wealth and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>.
*   The Swadishthana chakra's functioning can result in a "plethora of relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.
*   A strong Manipura chakra is essential for any leader, as it enables them to function effectively and be listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>.

Beyond these six traditional, normally functioning chakras, there are other chakras that are like "buds which are closed" in 99% of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>.

## Activating Chakras and Divine Guidance

These dormant chakras can be activated through the power of [[kundalini_and_kriya_yoga_practices | Kundalini]] and Shakti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>. Once activated, one specific chakra can lead to receiving an "adesh" (command) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. This command comes when an individual reaches a realm where they attain a Divine Guru, who may not be in physical form but guides them through these instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>.

The concept of [[significance_of_snakes_and_nagas_in_spirituality | snakes]] is often linked to Kundalini Shakti, as the original diagrams depict Kundalini as a coiled snake, rising and manifesting with an open hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>. This symbolism highlights the potent and transformative nature of the Kundalini energy when awakened.

Swa. Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success and personal development to his practice of [[celibacy_and_spiritual_growth | celibacy]] and the [[NoFap Movement and Motivation | NoFap movement]] for nine years. He believes these practices have provided him with a "superpower" to achieve his dreams, leading to a profound [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | personal growth journey]] and multi-million dollar business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Swa. Shashi's Journey and the Five Precepts

Swa. Shashi divides his life into two parts: before and after the age of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Before 17, he describes his life with "Three A's": arrogance, attitude, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. His childhood ambition was to play [[the_impact_of_sports_and_cricket_on_personal_development_and_cultural_significance | cricket]] for India and win the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. His parents enrolled him in yoga classes at six years old to help him balance and focus, which significantly improved his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

At 17, he continued yoga classes for his father and met a teacher who profoundly impacted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The teacher's honesty and direct approach about enlightenment resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This marked the beginning of his deep yoga journey, including rigorous "sadas" (disciplines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. He practiced silence for 40 days and meditated for nine hours a day, including Vipassana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Through completing these sadas, he consistently advanced in various aspects of his life, even becoming captain of his college cricket team during a challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

His teacher eventually gave him five precepts, which he committed to follow for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. These precepts are:
*   **No intoxification**: No alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Non-violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **No mental and physical stealing**: Not desiring what others possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **No lying**: Even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **[[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | Celibacy]]**: No sex, no physical contact, no fap, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

While the celibacy precept was initially challenging, especially given his age and accessibility to social situations, he committed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. After about 1.5 years, at age 19.5, these practices became a way of life, and he has not broken any of the five precepts since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Celibacy and Semen Retention

Swa. Shashi highlights that the benefits he experiences come from adhering to all five precepts, not just semen retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Enhanced Cognitive and Physical Abilities
Semen retention, in this context, means channeling energy upwards to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This process opens up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process," activating the right brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He personally felt this enhanced performance in his profession, cricket game, and overall confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This channeling of energy can be achieved through various yoga asanas and exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

He emphasizes that the fatigue often felt after ejaculation is due to energy release, whereas retention allows this energy to be utilized for higher functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### Managing Lust and Cravings
To manage feelings of lust, a simple yoga exercise involves:
1.  Sitting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  Taking a deep breath in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
3.  Visualizing the blood rush/energy flowing upwards to the spine and into the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
4.  Breathing out and imagining that energy spreading through the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

While initially difficult, adhering to [[NoFap Movement and Motivation | NoFap]] eventually makes it easier to resist cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Swa. Shashi acknowledges still feeling lust but is conscious of how to transmute it into compassion and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. He believes this is why women often feel safe around him, as he doesn't harbor physical desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

### Changes in Attraction and Relationships
Through semen retention, the definition of attraction shifts from the physical to a deeper, energetic connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. He suggests that the focus on physical attributes is superficial and asks why one does not feel compassion or love for every person of the opposite sex, rather than just physical desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The momentary pleasure of ejaculation is contrasted with a sustained state of higher energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

He views sex as a "beautiful thing" because it creates new life, but emphasizes the importance of intention and pure thought during conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

He genuinely believes these practices have provided him with a "superpower" to achieve his dreams, leading to a profound [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | personal growth journey]] and the creation of a multi-million dollar wellness business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   **[[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | Celibacy]]**: No sex, no physical contact, no fap, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

While the celibacy precept was initially challenging, especially given his age and accessibility to social situations, he committed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

He emphasizes that the fatigue often felt after ejaculation is due to energy release, whereas retention allows this energy to be utilized for higher functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. He asserts that a deeper scientific understanding of these effects is yet to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Managing Lust and Cravings
To manage feelings of lust, a simple yoga exercise involves:
1.  Sitting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  Taking a deep breath in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
3.  Visualizing the blood rush/energy flowing upwards to the spine and into the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
4.  Breathing out and imagining that energy spreading through the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

While initially difficult, adhering to [[NoFap Movement and Motivation | NoFap]] eventually makes it easier to resist cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Swa. Shashi acknowledges still feeling lust but is conscious of how to transmute it into compassion and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

He views sex as a "beautiful thing" because it creates new life, but emphasizes the importance of intention and pure thought during conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Success

Swa. Shashi is the sole founder of Diva Yoga, which is an all-women wellness startup, and SVA, a unisex "transformational" mother brand with a vision to connect 7 billion breaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. His wellness ecosystem has attracted over 40 investors, including notable figures such as Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malika Arora, Shahid Kapoor, Meera Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush (Rajinikanth's daughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Investors look at the founder, the business's purpose and scalability, and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Swa. Shashi believes his success is built on trust, love, respect, ethics, and values, challenging the notion that one must lie to run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Enhanced Intuition and Manifestation

Swa. Shashi's adherence to his spiritual lifestyle has significantly enhanced his intuition, often referred to as the "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. He believes that the universe tests one's mental strength when a path or goal is set, allowing individuals to withstand and overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

He provides examples of his intuition and manifestation:
*   His friend's black dress burning, forcing her to wear red as he had advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   Predicting his friend's UK visa approval and departure date, which came true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   Manifesting his desire to work with Christopher Nolan (though he hasn't yet) and having Jennifer Lopez invest in his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. He met Jennifer Lopez, flew with her on a private jet, and she is now an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

He asserts that everyone possesses intuition and gets "vibes," but some people realize it more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. He doesn't believe in coincidences, suggesting that thoughts and intentions at some point in life lead to eventual outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Intuition is linked to the Ajna Chakra, or third eye, which can be activated through various spiritual practices, including pranayama, meditation, and yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Daily Practice and Life Learnings

Swa. Shashi's intensive meditation practice is the "Anapana of Vipassana," which involves focusing on one's normal and natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to be an observer of thoughts without getting involved, allowing them to pass like "leaves in a river" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Even focusing for 30 seconds without distraction can lead to a different stage of awareness, increasing focus levels in waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. He believes one hour of yoga a day can provide energy for 23 hours and reduce the need for excessive sleep to 4-6 hours, emphasizing quality over quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

From his [[personal_struggles_and_growth_journey | life experiences]] and yogic learnings, he shares three key principles:
1.  **Be true and authentic to yourself**: This is critical, even when difficult. The first step to achieving any goal is to take that initial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
2.  **Self-care**: This includes both physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. One must love and take care of oneself to effectively care for or love others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. He recommends a mix of physical activities (gym, functional training) and mindful practices (breathing, meditation) to foster self-belief and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a people person**: Effective people management is crucial, especially in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good leader and fostering positive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

By balancing these three principles, Swa. Shashi believes one can become a more compassionate person and create positive change, much like how his personal transformation inspired him to start his yoga company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. He concludes with the philosophy: "Love like there is no tomorrow, and if tomorrow comes, love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

Suniel Shetty is an Indian actor, producer, and entrepreneur whose career spans over three decades. Known for his action hero roles and later his comedic performances, Shetty has also built a significant business empire outside of the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This article explores his personal philosophies, professional trajectory, and views on life, family, and health.

## Career and Professional Life

Shetty's journey in the film industry began with an opportunity thanks to his martial arts background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. His debut film, *Balwaan*, was a huge success, yet he was initially criticized as "wooden" by critics, who suggested he return to his family's Udupi restaurant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Unfazed, Shetty embraced his hospitality background, where the customer was always right, and work meant worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He attributes his ability to clean tables to his father, who did the same at 9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Ventures

Beyond acting, Shetty has maintained a "flourishing business career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. His entrepreneurial side, which he pursued even during his early acting career, provided him with confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. One notable venture mentioned is Astro Mischief, a game parlor that predates his acting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Evolution as an Actor

Initially, Shetty realized he had jumped into acting without formal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. To avoid being "dropped" as a bad actor, he began performing "death-defying stunts," which led to the birth of his "action hero" persona and a dedicated fan following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Through this process, he gradually learned the craft of acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Iconic Roles

Shetty has been part of several culturally impactful films:
*   ***Border***: This film holds immense significance for Shetty, who considers it a defining role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. He initially hesitated to join due to director J.P. Dutta's hotheaded reputation but was convinced by his mother-in-law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Shetty realized Dutta's deep love for the Indian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. The film's energy was dedicated to the armed forces and the sacrifices made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Shetty believes such films are vital for inspiring younger generations to join the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. He recounts a deeply moving experience visiting a military hospital during the Kargil War, reinforcing his respect for soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   ***Dhadkan***: Another character that has resonated culturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   ***Hera Pheri***: Shetty will soon return for the next installment of this popular comedy series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. He misses the comedy phase in the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   ***Hunter***: Shetty recently starred in this action film, marking his return to the genre. He describes his approach now as "smarter, wiser" and more character-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

### Challenges in the Hindi Film Industry
Shetty notes that while there's much adulation and love in the industry, the rise of social media has eliminated privacy, leading to harassment and the destruction of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He feels actors are often forced to be diplomatic to avoid online abuse and attacks on their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He also acknowledges the significant increase in monetary compensation for actors today compared to his peak years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Life Journey

Shetty is in a phase of "relooking at myself, reinventing myself" and making his work meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. He focuses on enjoying life and connecting with youth through conversations about health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Ageing and Wisdom
Shetty views ageing as a beautiful journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. While an action hero might slow down, ageing brings wisdom, allowing for smarter decision-making and better presentation on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. He emphasizes goal-setting and manifestation, citing his own achievements of being "fittest 50" and having a "six-pack at 60" through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

### Family and Relationships
[[Suniel Shettys insights on masculinity and mentorship | Mentors]] and positive masculinity are crucial, especially for millennials and Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Shetty highlights the importance of choosing the right partner, as they can significantly impact one's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. He married his wife Mana after nine years of courtship at the start of his career, a decision he considers his "most beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. He believes a strong marriage and family life greatly benefit mental health and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

Shetty advises prioritizing family time, such as dedicating Sundays to loved ones, and disconnecting from work calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. He also emphasizes mutual respect, trust, and independence within a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.

His relationship with his own father was very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. He believes it's up to sons to approach their fathers, sit and chat without expectation, to strengthen the bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. He continues to seek his father's assurance, attributing his honesty to his father's teaching: "If you don't lie, you'll have no fear in you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>.

Shetty shares a "blessed" relationship with his daughter, Athiya, and son-in-law, [[KL Rahuls cricket journey and personal growth | KL Rahul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

He always advises Rahul not to lose confidence due to external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>.

### Philanthropy and Giving
Shetty believes in continuous corporate social responsibility (CSR), not just in terms of money, but in giving time and listening to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. He emphasizes giving without expectation and forgetting what has been given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. His mother-in-law had a profound impact on him, teaching him to give and love without expecting anything in return through her work with Save the Children India and Via Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>.

### Spiritual Beliefs
Shetty is interested in paranormal subjects, particularly spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. As a Shetty, he has grown up witnessing and believing in "Bhoota Kolu," the House of Spirits, and the importance of Kul Dvi, attending pujas annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.

## [[Suniel Shettys approach to health and fitness | Health and Fitness]]

Shetty attributes his youthful appearance to focusing on health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. His fitness routine is integrated into his lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>:
*   **Diet (80%):** Clean, home-cooked food, counting calories and oil, avoiding "white" foods (milk, white rice, salt, sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. He rarely orders from outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **Training (10%):** 45 minutes to an hour of early morning training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Habits (10%):** Early to bed, early to rise (up by 4-6 AM, sleep by 10-10:30 PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. He prioritizes consistent sleep over daily variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

He briefly tried protein supplements but found they didn't suit him, preferring natural supplementation based on nutritionist advice and blood routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Shetty emphasizes that "food is life" and what one eats defines who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>. He advocates for children engaging in sports to develop coordination, confidence, and learn about winning and losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections and Outlook

Shetty is obsessed with his name, given his father's and his own admiration for Sunil Gavaskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>. He enjoys dressing casually and comfortably while maintaining a unique style, which inspired his brand, Mischief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. Surprisingly, he describes himself as the "laziest bum on Earth" on Sundays, refusing to move and preferring to be spoiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>.

His favorite object to be buried with is sandalwood for its aroma and association with peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>. He often thinks about his own death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:00">[37:44:00]</a>. His most fearful moment was when his father was deteriorating during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.

Shetty's biggest regret is not playing cricket for the country or state, as he was an all-rounder and fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>. He believes if T20 had existed, he would have represented the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:03:00">[45:03:00]</a>. He considers money as something that "comes and goes" and has never been a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:29:00">[46:29:00]</a>.

Looking back, he wishes he had more "brains" and "street smarts" in his 20s, as he was too innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:00]</a>. In his 30s, he wished for more "knowledge of acting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:00">[48:02:00]</a>.

Shetty feels he is beginning a "new innings" in his career, more conscious of taking others along who are less fortunate. He aims to "give back" with this second chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. He believes that true wisdom comes from experiencing both lows and highs, advising not to let success go to one's head or failure to one's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

> "Don't let success go to this and don't let failure go to your heart here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>

> "I belong to a world...my only reasoning was oh office is closed what will the kids do then when we started little bit of online I said guys make sure we can get more kids on board because lot of being laid out so can I end the pandemic with five people extra working for me you know I don't balance my books by offloading people during the financial year end you know my books are balanced my my my know my books are balanced my my my numbers are looking good I don't do that I don't I don't come from that world you know so yes which is why God blesses you exactly and that's why I believe I am lucky and so these little things do matter to me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>

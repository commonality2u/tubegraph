Looking handsome, particularly for the average young Indian guy, is primarily about appearing clean and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Many believe handsomeness is solely about innate looks, but it largely depends on how neat and tidy one appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To look attractive, especially to Indian women, it's about appearing clean, "like you've had a bath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Women universally associate cleanliness with looking good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Foundational Cleanliness

Basic male grooming addresses common issues for Indian men, such as acne, oily skin, scruffy hair, and high humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The goal is to look clean and tidy using simple, everyday methods rather than fancy products or techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Haircuts

Haircuts significantly affect one's face structure and overall appearance, influencing how scruffy someone looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For many Indian men with rough hair, growing it out is not advisable unless it's silky smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. To appear neat and classy, a "golden haircut" with a slightly long top and short sides is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This style is observed on many well-groomed athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The most crucial rule for a haircut is to look neat and tidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### [[facial_hair_grooming_techniques | Facial Hair Grooming]]

Getting your facial hair "game" correct is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Options include growing out a full beard (which requires its own grooming) or stylizing it, such as a goatee or soul patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, young men should avoid mustaches, as they can make one look like a "child molester" rather than older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The safest, most evergreen approach is to be clean-shaven, as "nothing says clean and tidy like being clean shaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

For shaving, a quality razor is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A good razor features strong, durable blades that don't need frequent replacement, a quality grip to prevent cuts, and spring-mounted blades for precision, especially when avoiding pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Secondary Facial Hair

Beyond the primary beard and mustache, attention must be paid to secondary facial hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>:
*   **Ear Hair**: Common among Indian men, it can be shaved off with a regular razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Nose Hair**: Trim with small, super narrow, super sharp scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Unibrow**: Many Indian men have a unibrow, which can "ruin your handsome game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Using tweezers is recommended, not full clean-shaving, to maintain a natural look with a few strands of hair remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A good quality pair of tweezers will have perfectly matching ends when joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Face Cleanliness

Even after managing facial hair, the face itself needs attention to go from looking sleepy to fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Daily Face Washing**: A basic, mild face wash helps remove oil, which if accumulated, increases pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Young men, especially those who frequent the gym, are more prone to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Washing the face twice daily (morning and before bedtime) can significantly prevent and minimize acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Ensure the face wash is rubbed deep into the skin and rinsed with tepid (room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Removing excess oil and sebum makes the face look much cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Bonus Skincare Routine**: For special occasions like important meetings or parties, an optional routine can enhance neatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This involves a basic moisturizer to rehydrate skin and baby powder (not regular talcum powder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Baby powder has finer granules that are less likely to block pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. While not for daily use (as too much moisturizer can block pores and cause acne, especially for oily skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>), this occasional routine subtly reduces oiliness and grunginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If too much product is applied, it can be wiped down with a slightly wet cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This is considered the closest thing to makeup for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Hand and Nail Cleanliness

Women often gauge cleanliness by looking at a man's hands and feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Since hands are always exposed, it's crucial to keep nails short and clean, removing any dirt from underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. These small rules are vital for long-term handsomeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. For calluses, common in gym-goers, using a little moisturizer can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## The Perception of Handsome: Fragrances

Beyond physical body cleanliness, how one smells significantly contributes to the perception of handsomeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Women associate men with their scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Therefore, for first encounters and impressions, wearing perfume is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Introduction to Indian Supernatural Beings

Indian folklore and spiritual traditions describe a diverse range of supernatural entities. Many of these beings have specific origins and characteristics, often tied to their manner of death or unfulfilled desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The nature of these entities is often portrayed as inhabiting a realm of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Types of Entities

### Yakinis
[[experiences_with_demonic_entities | Yakshin]] (or Yakini) are described as demigoddesses, particularly prevalent in South India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. They are believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven, called Alkapuri, which is governed by Kubar, the brother of Lord Ravana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. When Yakinis come to Earth, they are mostly in their evil forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. They are depicted as voluptuous and beautiful, but their seduction wears off to reveal an evil form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Their victims are typically men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Chudels and Dians
Chudels and Dians share a similar origin story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is believed that when a woman dies during childbirth or while pregnant, and is not properly cremated with all necessary rituals, she turns into a Chudel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This transformation is due to a latent desire in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. As a Chudel, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A Chudel is a type of vengeful entity, not simply a ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Dians are similar, with their nature often based on regional beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Pishach
The Pishach, a ghoul in Hindu mythology, is believed to be created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Unlike poltergeists, a Pishach is capable of killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Poltergeists
Poltergeists are characterized as noisy ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They are generally not considered evil but are mischievous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. They may try to disorient individuals and sap their energies, but they hardly kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Betal
A Betal is a hanging ghost that clings to trees, particularly banyan or peepal trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. It is typically a man who has died with unfulfilled wishes, remaining attached to a permanent structure like a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A Betal usually does not have a physical form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. They are believed to haunt passersby, sometimes even traveling with them to their homes to create havoc and jeopardize their lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Ghosts
It is generally believed that ghosts are formed when a person experiences an unnatural death before their destined time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This belief suggests that the remaining time in their life is spent in the earthly realm as a ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While some ghosts are considered evil, the majority are believed to be good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Evil ghosts are often those who had something left to do in their lives, or who experienced an unjust or violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Perspectives from [[paranormal_investigation_methods | Paranormal Investigators]]
Neil D'Silva, a horror writer, has engaged with [[scientific_investigation_of_haunted_locations | paranormal investigators]] to understand the truth behind these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He notes that no two investigators hold the exact same theory regarding ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Jay Alani's View
Jay Alani, a rationalist, believes that a significant portion of the [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | paranormal world]], especially in India, is driven by blind faith, superstition, and commercial propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He seeks to distinguish genuine occult phenomena from fabricated instances, such as those used for quick financial gain through black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Alani often investigates to find the root cause of hauntings, which can sometimes be human mischief or an object acting as an epicenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. For example, a souvenir purchased from a foreign country was found to be carrying a spirit, leading to a terrible accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Sarbajit Miti's View
Sarbajit Miti believes that [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | paranormal energies]] are ubiquitous, forming a separate dimension that can perceive humans but with which humans cannot easily interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. He and his psychic partner, Puja, have encountered significant dark energy, such as around a tree where young men in a village were compelled to hang themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Personal Encounters and Manifestations
Individuals who write about or deeply research horror and the paranormal often report feeling that they attract these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Neil D'Silva recounted an experience in Goa where he felt a cold presence and observed flickering lights specifically in his room while writing a horror novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These experiences can include vivid dreams or physical manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### The Role of Trees
In India, trees, especially banyan and peepal trees, are traditionally believed to house spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. There is folklore suggesting that one should not walk under these trees at night as they can be safe havens for spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These spirits might even attempt to possess individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Dealing with Entities and Dark Forces
Various cultures and spiritual practices offer methods for [[dealing_with_entities_and_dark_forces | countering dark energies]] and cleansing environments.

*   **Rituals and Objects:** The use of specific rituals and objects is believed to be effective in [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | paranormal activities]]. For example, in *The Conjuring* films, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren used artifacts in their museum to contain entities, including the Annabelle doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Chanting and Meditation:** In Hinduism, chanting and meditation are believed to cleanse environments and provide protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. A personal account described using a mantra to create a protective field against dark forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Salt Water Baths:** Salt water is commonly believed to wash off negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | Skepticism and Belief in Spiritual Phenomena]]
The existence of paranormal entities is a subject of debate, with science often demanding tangible proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. While devices like K2 meters can detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) where no typical source exists, these readings are considered observed proof rather than direct evidence of a ghostly entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The challenge lies in scientifically proving the existence of another world or energetic entities that cannot be seen with normal human eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Despite the lack of definitive scientific proof, many believers hold that a spiritual connection and intuitive experiences validate these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

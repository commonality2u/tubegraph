## India-Pakistan Relations

Historically, the biggest threat to a country can be cutting off its water supply [00:00:00]. This is evident in the relationship between India and [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]].

### Indus Water Treaty
[[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] has adhered to the Indus Water Treaty, the only treaty they have abided by with India, primarily because they have a "favorable deal" [00:00:09]. According to the treaty, [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] receives more water than they should [00:00:16]. The current agreement involves rivers flowing into [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]], and while India was to utilize the southern rivers, it has not been able to make full use of them [00:15:56]. India believes the 70/30 water equation should change [00:16:10], potentially to a 50/50 balance [00:16:14].

However, [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] considers a change to the treaty an "act of war" [00:16:22]. India would prefer a negotiated settlement, hoping [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] "sees reason" given its current "awful mess" [00:17:15]. Violating a signed treaty could result in losing international sympathy [00:16:46].

### Military and Intelligence Stance
India's stance on security has evolved, particularly in response to actions from [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]].
*   **1965 Pakistani Invasion**: India was caught "unawares" when [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] sent in "Freedom Fighters" into Kashmir [00:07:20]. India had to cross the international boundary at Lahore to prevent Kashmir from being cut off [00:07:36]. This incident, along with the 1962 Chinese invasion, highlighted the need for a dedicated external intelligence agency [00:08:13].
*   **1971 War with Pakistan**: The Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) had its first major success during the 1971 war, assisting the Mukti Bahini (Liberation fighters of Bangladesh) in overthrowing the Pakistani regime in Dhaka [00:09:29]. RAW helped train and equip them to fight Pakistani regular forces [00:10:04].
*   **Balakot Counter-Attack**: The Balakot counter-attack following the Pulwama incident served as a "message" that India would retaliate and "do it again" [01:03:00]. This action made a difference, and the "tune has been different since then" [01:03:23].
*   **Mumbai 2008 Attacks**: In contrast to the Balakot response, India "did nothing" after the 2008 Mumbai attacks [01:03:52]. There would have been a reaction if the current Prime Minister had been in power [01:04:20]. The speaker suggests the world "would have actually forgiven" India if it had retaliated the second day [01:04:40].
*   **Dawood Ibrahim**: Dawood Ibrahim settled in [[Pakistans Political and Economic Situation | Pakistan]] after the 1993 Bombay bombings, where he married his daughter to Jabir Motiwala [00:58:35]. He is believed to be protected by the ISI and Pakistani military [00:58:51] because he finances them and helps create trouble [00:59:09]. In 1993, there was no intelligence indicating the magnitude of the Bombay bombings [00:59:31].

## India-China Relations

India's relationship with China has been shaped by historical events and ongoing [[chinas_geopolitical_challenges | geopolitical challenges]].

### Historical Context
*   **1962 Chinese Invasion**: India experienced a significant setback during the Chinese Invasion in 1962 [00:07:11]. This event, along with the 1965 Pakistani invasion, led to the decision to form a new organization, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), specifically to deal with external threats [00:08:24].

### Geopolitical Dynamics and Perceptions
Discussions around China's stability often originate from Western narratives [00:39:49].
*   **Western Narratives**: The West frequently propagates ideas about internal troubles in China, such as issues in Xinjiang and Tibet, and a declining economy [00:40:21]. However, the speaker suggests that large countries like China "just don't die away" [00:41:25].
*   **Autocracy and Resilience**: The Chinese, as a civilization, are accustomed to autocratic rulers [00:41:40]. Their resilience is described as "much more than [the West] think[s] it is" [00:42:27]. This resilience is compared to that of the Russians, who fought against Hitler in St. Petersburg for a year and a half on "bread and water" [00:42:40]. This inherent strength allows leaders like Putin and the Chinese to "not give in" [00:43:03].
*   **"War Without Having to Kill"**: The Chinese belief that the best war is one fought "without having to kill," but by suborning the race and people [00:39:05], highlights their strategic approach.
*   **Economic Aid from the West**: Ironically, much of China's economic strength has come from Western aid, which made them rich for their own reasons [00:34:34].

### [[Media perceptions and geopolitical tensions between India and China | Media Perceptions and Geopolitical Tensions]]
Social media is utilized by intelligence agencies for both information collection and influence [00:18:15]. India likely faces attempts by Chinese and Pakistani intelligence agencies to "twist narratives" on social media [00:18:48]. This is part of the "game" of psychological impact and story manipulation [00:18:29].

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Tamannaah Bhatia's personal and professional life, affecting her health, body image, and overall perspective.

## Contracting COVID-19 and Recovery
Tamannaah Bhatia experienced a "train that I did not see coming" when she contracted COVID-19. The night before her diagnosis, she was shooting and felt a very strong, high fever [03:31]. She was also working out hectically, initially attributing her tiredness to pushing herself after the lockdown [03:57]. Her parents had previously gone through the illness, so she recognized the signs of trouble [03:48].

Upon waking the next morning, her temperature hadn't gone down, and her oxygen levels were low [03:53]. Her producer, Prep, from the web show she was filming for Ahaha (a Telugu web portal), quickly rushed her to Continental Hospitals in Hyderabad within 10 minutes [03:10]. She received top-notch treatment from the medical staff and doctors for five days, after which she was discharged and quarantined for the necessary period [03:20].

The experience was "really scary" as she had never been hospitalized before [03:41]. During her hospital stay, she faced trouble breathing, though she initially didn't realize the severity of it, feeling very tired and experiencing immense body ache, which she mistook for fatigue from intense workouts [03:47]. The hospitalization made her realize the solitude one faces during major life events, despite her parents flying down to Hyderabad from Mumbai to be near her [03:41].

## Post-COVID-19 Physical and Public Scrutiny
After recovering from COVID-19 and being on heavy medication, Tamannaah Bhatia faced insensitive comments about her appearance [00:01]. She recounted people calling her to say she looked "a little fat in your pictures" [00:09]. She found this shocking, questioning "what is wrong with people" and their insensitivity towards someone who has gone through an illness [00:16].

She highlighted that this scrutiny is a downside of fame; actors are "too scrutinized" and expected to be presentable at all times, even when sick or going through personal trauma [02:00]. This societal expectation means that even if she is having a bad day or going through something traumatizing, people will still approach her for a selfie, expecting her to oblige [02:32].

## Shifting Perspectives and Personal Growth
The COVID-19 experience brought about significant changes in Tamannaah Bhatia's outlook on life, particularly regarding peace, priorities, and self-love.

### Redefining Happiness and Peace
The pandemic made her realize that true happiness isn't a fixed destination, but rather found in enjoying "the small things" [04:21]. She consciously started to appreciate simple pleasures, such as eating a bag of chips with friends, dressed casually, without makeup [04:33].

Her biggest void in life, she revealed, is peace [07:09]. She finds it hard to be peaceful given her demanding career and the constant desire to be in control [07:19]. She works constantly, having no concept of Saturdays or Sundays for much of her career, and recognizes that achieving "rich and famous" status doesn't necessarily bring peace; it can even add to the "craziness" and make peace harder to attain [07:30].

The lockdown served as a "big reality check," making her realize what truly matters in life [09:40]. She shifted her focus from long-term goals (like 10 years down the line) to being present and aware of each day [10:13]. The experience reinforced that she sleeps well when she has a good day at work, indicating a shift towards valuing daily experiences over future aspirations [10:16].

### Learning from Experience and Self-Love
The near-death experience during her hospitalization led her to prioritize giving "what is really what you really want in life time and effort" [03:37]. She became a "new person" who can no longer "fake it" and expresses her true feelings directly [03:46]. This aligns with her belief that experiences teach more than reading, as action reveals the true nature of situations, such as relationships [03:09].

She recognized that she had been very harsh on herself and learned about "ahimsa" (non-violence) towards oneself through yoga [03:40]. She believes that being hard on oneself projects negativity onto others [03:22]. Her self-awareness extends to recognizing the physical toll of her fast-paced work and the need to find a balance between her drive and self-care [03:55]. This internal shift allowed her to drop her guards in interviews, a change she attributes to the lockdown's reality check [09:34].

### Emphasis on Gratitude and Core Values
The COVID-19 phase brought a profound realization about gratitude. She made a conscious and proactive effort to thank people who are pivotal in her life, recognizing that she couldn't achieve most things without the help of others [02:45]. This practice, she believes, is not just for others but also beneficial for oneself [03:12].

In essence, the pandemic and her battle with COVID-19 served as a transformative period for Tamannaah Bhatia, leading to a deeper understanding of personal well-being, the importance of presence, and the need for self-compassion amidst the pressures of fame. Her parents' constant support has also been a significant factor in her life and achievements, which she views as incomplete without them [03:53].

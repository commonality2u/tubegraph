Sva Shashi, recognized as one of India's leading young entrepreneurs, attributes his success significantly to his dedicated practice of celibacy and adherence to yogic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He claims that nine years of celibacy and "no fap" (no ejaculation) have provided him with a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His [[entrepreneurship_journey|entrepreneurship journey]] is deeply intertwined with his [[spirituality_and_personal_wellbeing|spiritual and personal wellbeing]] practices.

## Sva Shashi's Yogic Path and Entrepreneurial Foundation

Shashi's life is divided into two parts: before and after age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Initially, his main goal was to play cricket for India and win the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. His parents enrolled him in yoga classes at age six to help him balance and focus, which he noted significantly improved his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

At 17, Shashi inherited yoga classes from his father and met a teacher who profoundly impacted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite initial skepticism towards "godmen," the teacher's honesty resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. His early interest in intuition and enlightenment was selfish, aiming to enhance his cricket performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### The Five Precepts

After 30-45 days of classes, Shashi began practicing "sadas" (disciplines), such as remaining silent for 40 days or meditating for nine hours daily, including Vipassana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Each completed sada propelled him forward in life, professionally and in his game, such as becoming the captain of his college cricket team when he thought he might be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

His teacher then presented him with five life precepts:
1.  **No Intoxication**: No alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing**: Neither physical nor mental (e.g., coveting others' possessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Not even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy**: No sex, no physical contact, no fap, no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The celibacy precept, initially proposed for seven years, was the most challenging due to his age and "accessibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. For the first 1.5 years, he pursued these practices to prove his teacher wrong, but by age 19.5, they had become a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. At 27, he still adheres to all five precepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Diva Yoga and SVA: A Wellness Ecosystem

Shashi established Diva Yoga, one of India's largest wellness startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While yoga forms its authentic foundation, the company aims to build a broader wellness ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Diva Yoga is an all-women, aspirational brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Its mother brand, SVA (Sanskrit for "all complete"), is unisex and transformational, with a vision statement of "connecting 7 billion breaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The company has attracted over 40 investors, including notable figures like Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malaika Arora, Shahid Kapoor, Mira Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush (Rajinikanth's daughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Investors look at the founder, purpose, scalability, and team when considering an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Impact on Entrepreneurial Success

Shashi believes his consistent application of these yogic principles, particularly semen retention, has provided significant benefits for his entrepreneurial endeavors:

### Enhanced Creativity and Performance
Semen retention is described as taking energy from the lower parts of the body to the brain, which "opens up a completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This channeled energy leads to peak performance levels in any profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Shashi challenges others to try "no fap" for just 21 days to experience the increased energy and reduced tiredness often associated with ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Practicing semen retention can also make a person more magnetic and attractive, not necessarily physically, but in terms of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This can shift one's definition of attraction beyond the physical, fostering feelings of compassion and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### Honesty and Trust
Shashi states he has built his business largely on trust, love, respect, ethics, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Not lying, one of his precepts, has led to surprising outcomes. He recounts instances where his truthful, seemingly accidental predictions (e.g., a friend's dress burning, a visa being granted on a specific date) came true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. His teacher explained that nature conspires to make things happen for those who consistently practice honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This demonstrates the [[role_of_manifestation_and_spirituality_in_success|role of manifestation and spirituality in success]].

### Intuition
While not consciously using intuition for career advancement, Shashi notes that his spiritual and clean lifestyle enhances his "sixth sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He believes everyone is intuitive and receives vibes, but some are more attuned to realizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. His experiences, such as envisioning Jennifer Lopez as an investor and then having it materialize, align with the concept of manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. He links intuition to the Ajna chakra (third eye), which can be activated through practices like meditation and pranayama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### Meditation Practice
Shashi's intensive meditation practice involves Vipassana's "anapana" â€“ focusing on the normal, natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to observe thoughts without engagement, like "leaves in a river," to remain in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This practice significantly increases focus levels in daily waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. He suggests that an hour of yoga daily can energize one for 23 hours, requiring less sleep (4-6 hours of quality sleep suffice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Life Lessons for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Shashi shares three key learnings for entrepreneurs and individuals alike:

1.  **Be Authentic and True to Yourself**: Despite external pressures, staying true to one's self is crucial, as the first step is essential for any journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
2.  **Practice Self-Care (Physical and Mental)**: This involves taking care of oneself both physically (e.g., gym, functional training) and mentally (e.g., mindful practices, breathing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. It's about self-love and building self-belief to become a better version of oneself daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person**: Especially for entrepreneurs or CEOs, effective people management is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good employer and fostering strong team relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

These collective practices lead to becoming a more compassionate person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Shashi's personal transformation inspired him to [[building_a_personal_brand_spreading_positivity|spread this message]] globally through his wellness company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. He concludes with the philosophy: "Love like there is no tomorrow and if tomorrow comes, love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

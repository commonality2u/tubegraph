Robert Kiyosaki, author of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, expresses significant concerns about the current financial state of America, describing it as "bankrupt" and the "biggest debtor nation in the world," surpassed only by Japan in its level of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Economic Policies and Their Impact

Kiyosaki critically views the economic policies enacted by the current U.S. administration. He specifically points to President Biden's decision to cut the Keystone pipeline, which he claims caused the price of oil to skyrocket from $30 a barrel to $130 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Kiyosaki asserts that this action was a deliberate move to "destroy the middle class," leading to a society polarized into only two classes: the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. He characterizes President Biden as a "communist," contrasting him with Donald Trump, whom he describes as a "capitalist" and a "very good man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

Kiyosaki expresses concern about the [[the_future_of_the_usa | future of the USA]], stating that the country is "in serious trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. He also notes the rise of poverty and homelessness, drawing parallels between the slums of Mumbai and the spreading slums across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. He attributes this problem, in part, to the prevalence of "fake money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

## "Fake Money" vs. "Real Money"

A central tenet of Kiyosaki's [[investment_advice_from_robert_kiyosaki | investment advice]] is the distinction between "fake money" (fiat currency like the dollar or rupee, which he calls "toilet paper") and "real money" (gold, silver, and Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. He advocates for investing in assets that hold their value, such as silver, which he considers the "best investment in the world today," as well as gold, real estate, oil wells, and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:0:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>. He believes that working for "fake money" (a job with a salary in fiat currency) is the "worst advice possible" and encourages working for assets instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>.

## Critique of the Educational System

Kiyosaki maintains that [[the_educational_systems_failure_to_teach_financial_literacy | schools fail to teach financial literacy]], a critical omission that perpetuates a misunderstanding of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. He argues that many school teachers are "marxists" or "communists" who don't possess a "money building mindset" and believe in redistributing wealth rather than generating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. He challenges the common educational mantra, "stay in school, you'll be rich," calling it a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. He directly advises people *not* to go to school if they want to be rich because schools teach people to work for "fake money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. Kiyosaki also emphasizes the importance of integrity, defining it as one's body, mind, words, heart, and actions being "one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. He applies this to blockchain technology, noting he invests in Bitcoin because it "has integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.

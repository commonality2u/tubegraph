The modern island of Sri Lanka was not the ancient Lanka of the Ramayana; Ravana's Lanka was located east of Maldives, where now only deep ocean exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This perspective challenges extreme right-wing portals that connect the Ram Setu to modern Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

Instead, ancient [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Indian]] texts, particularly the Puranas and the Ramayana, contain descriptions that are interpreted to indicate connections between ancient India and South America, a land referred to as "Patal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.

## Patala: The Land of South America

Patal is identified as South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. The texts describe this land as opulent and prosperous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:11">[02:49:11]</a>.

### King Bali and Virochana
The **Bhagavata Purana** recounts the story of King Bali, who was subdued by Vamana and kept under house arrest, possibly in present-day Indonesia (the island of Bali) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:53">[02:50:53]</a>. After his restrictions were removed, Bali did not return to India but went further to Patal, where he established various colonies such as Sutala, Atala, Talatala, and Rasatala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:59">[02:56:59]</a>.

Intriguingly, South American lore, particularly among the Incas, speaks of a civilizing figure named Virocha (or Virochana), who arrived from across the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:13">[02:38:13]</a>. Virochana is described in [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Indian]] texts as Bali's great-great-grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>.

### Aztecs and Nagas
In Mexico, the term "Aztecs" is linked to "Astik," a sage associated with the Nagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>. The Nagas, often depicted with snake-like features, are mentioned in the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] as human beings, notably during the establishment of Indraprastha (modern New Delhi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:45">[02:30:45]</a>. It is conjectured that these Naga people might have migrated to South America with Bali, explaining the prevalence of snake symbolism in Central and South American cultures, often referred to as "dragons" by Chinese travelers who took an alternate route through Alaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:10">[02:30:10]</a>.

## Sugriva's Atlas: Ramayana's Global Knowledge
The [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Ramayana]], dating back over 14,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, demonstrates an awareness of various global lands. Sugriva, a character in the epic, gives detailed geographical landmarks to the Vanara parties sent in search of Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:43">[03:40:43]</a>.

### East Direction and the Candelabra of Andes
Sugriva's instructions for the eastern direction are particularly striking:
1.  Starting from the center of India, one would pass through the "land of silver" (Thailand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:20">[03:17:20]</a>.
2.  Then, the "Yavadweepa," the land of grains (Java), is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:26">[03:17:26]</a>.
3.  After crossing numerous islands and the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:35">[03:17:35]</a>, the Ramayana describes a region marked by "Lord Ananta" (Anant Dev) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:28">[03:51:28]</a>.

The text details a specific landmark: a "Trish gold shining like a gold yellow color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>, resembling a pillar or flag, established at the front of a mountain with a "yoni-like" (rectangular) base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:51">[03:25:51]</a>. This description corresponds precisely to the "Candelabra of Andes," a massive trident-like geoglyph found on the west coast of Peru near the Bay of Paracas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:03">[03:07:03]</a>. The structure is approximately 800 feet tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a> and glows yellow at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. Locals, including their grandparents, have no knowledge of its origin, stating it was always there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

The Ramayana not only describes the structure but also states that Indra, the deity of the East Direction, established it in the Krita Yuga, long before the Ramayana period, to mark the end of the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:03">[03:43:03]</a>.

Furthermore, the Ramayana mentions the "Maha mandas" or "mandas" which are described as horrifying, merciless demons of various shapes, similar to mountains in size, dangling upside down from mountain peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>. These are interpreted as large vampire bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:38">[03:38:38]</a>. Today, the only place in the world where blood-sucking vampire bats are found is South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>.

> [!info] Ramayana's description of South American bats
> *"Therefore, know thereabout horrifying and merciless demons of various shapes and similar to mountains and size called mandas will be dangling upside down from mountain peaks."* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:50">[03:29:50]</a>

The text also refers to a "white mountain of colossal size named Rishabha" with a lake named Sudarshan nearby, which is said to be replete with silvery lotuses and golden fibrils, with kingly swans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:14">[04:13:14]</a>. This aligns with the geography of the Amazon, Bolivia, and Peru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:10">[04:19:10]</a>.

### Mount Ananta
Ananta is referred to as the Andes mountain range, with its thousand heads representing each peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:05">[04:53:05]</a>. The Ramayana describes a "thousand-hooded serpent God In Black clothing named ananta sitting on top of that mountain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:47">[04:11:47]</a>. In the Andes, there is a mountain specifically named Mount Ananta, which is likely a local indigenous name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:50">[04:39:50]</a>. The Ramayana provides explicit descriptions of this mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:50">[04:48:50]</a>.

### Ravana's Reach
Ravana, the antagonist of the Ramayana, is depicted as having conquered the whole world, including South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:03">[02:41:03]</a>. His sister, Shurpanakha, married a person who went to South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This suggests ancient transnational marriages and powerful human beings with extensive global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Traditional Archaeology
The speaker, Nilesh Oak, an engineer and evidence-based historian, notes that traditional academic archaeologists and historians often dislike individuals like him who approach history from a scientific and evidence-based perspective without formal degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:59">[03:10:59]</a>. He argues that the "rules of dirt archaeology" were created as a "fiction" in a European mind and can limit understanding when ancient texts are dismissed because they don't follow these specific rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:17">[03:51:17]</a>.

> [!quote] Nilesh Oak on Academia
> "But if you scan history, there's been a lot of greats who've not gone to a particular college to study a particular subject and still become experts of that subject." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:18">[04:14:18]</a>
> "And that's what I've picked up from people like yourself and Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson that you guys think in open space, you guys think in free space, you all reference ancient texts and you all don't dismiss ancient texts based on the fact that they simply don't follow the rules of dirt archaeology." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:46">[06:21:46]</a>

Oak asserts that when the historical timelines of events like the [[cultural_and_historical_significance_of_ancient_indian_scriptures | Mahabharata]] and Ramayana are astronomically established (Mahabharata >7,000 years ago, Ramayana >14,000 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, it opens up the possibility of [[lost_history_and_archeological_mysteries_of_ancient_india | uncovering evidence]] for these deep periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Dismissing deep antiquity of human civilization prevents researchers from even looking for corroborating evidence in geological and archaeological data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

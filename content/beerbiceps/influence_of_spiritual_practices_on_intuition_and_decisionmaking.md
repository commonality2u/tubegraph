Svarish Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success to his dedicated [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | spiritual practice]], which includes celibacy and intensive yoga training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His journey highlights how adhering to specific spiritual disciplines can profoundly impact one's intuition, decision-making, and overall life path.

## The Foundation of Spiritual Practice

Svarish began his journey into deeper yoga practices at age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Initially, he focused on the physical aspects of [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | yoga]], such as *Surya Namaskar* and [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. His father encouraged him to complete a [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | yoga]] class, leading him to a teacher who emphasized honesty and self-enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

After about 30-45 days of classes, Svarish started practicing *sadhanas*, which means discipline in Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These *sadhanas* included:
*   Going silent for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Meditating for 9 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Practicing Vipassana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Being mindful of his actions and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

He observed that each time he completed a *sadhana*, he advanced in various aspects of his life, professionally and personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. For instance, in a year he expected to be dropped from his college cricket team, he became its captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The Five Precepts

His teacher eventually gave him five core precepts to follow, which Svarish committed to for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. These precepts were:
1.  **No Intoxication**: Abstaining from alcohol, smoking, and non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Practicing non-violence through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Mental and Physical Stealing**: Avoiding both physical theft and mentally coveting others' possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Not even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy (Brahmacharya)**: No sex, no masturbation, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The celibacy precept was the most challenging due to his age and accessibility to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Initially, he followed it to prove his teacher wrong, but after about 1.5 years (by age 19.5), it became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He has not broken any of these five precepts, seeing significant positive changes in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Impact on Intuition and Decision-Making

### Semen Retention and Creative Energy
Svarish explains that semen retention involves taking energy upwards to the brain, which opens up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This heightened energy enhances "Peak Performance" in any profession, making one more confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He encourages others to try semen retention for just 21 days to experience its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Enhanced Intuition (Sixth Sense)
A [[spirituality_and_personal_wellbeing | spiritual lifestyle]] and clean living can significantly increase intuitive power, often referred to as the "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. This includes knowing things before they happen, sensing a person's vibe, or understanding situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. While Svarish's intuition is "extremely unreal" and has led to "pretty amazing" outcomes (like predicting specific dates for events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>, he states that he has never consciously used it for his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. His teacher taught him that [[spirituality_and_meditation | spirituality]] (Adhyatm) means "coming to oneself" and "being in the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Consciously seeking intuition would break the practice of being in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

Svarish believes that everyone is intuitive and gets "vibes," but some people realize it more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. He dismisses coincidence, stating that events are often the result of prior thoughts and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. His own experiences, such as manifesting a meeting with Jennifer Lopez, whom he had envisioned as an investor, demonstrate the power of belief and [[role_of_manifestation_and_spirituality_in_success | manifestation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

#### Ajna Chakra (Third Eye)
Intuition and the Sixth Sense are linked to the Ajna chakra, also known as the "third eye," which is the sixth chakra in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Opening this chakra, through various practices like energy work, pranayama, and [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]], enhances intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. However, it can be blocked by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Shift in Attraction and Relationships
Svarish's perception of attraction has changed due to his practices, moving beyond superficial physical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. He now feels a sense of safety and trust with people, as they recognize his internal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He aims to transform any initial lustful feelings into compassion and love for the other person and himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. He states that he still experiences lust, but is conscious of how to redirect that energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Philosophy

Svarish's spiritual journey has led to significant personal growth and a unique approach to life:
*   **Consciousness over Emotion**: He is conscious of his emotions, even feeling upset or vulnerable, but knows that these feelings will also change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Modern [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | Spirituality]]**: He believes it's possible to live in the modern world, run a business, and adhere to spiritual principles like honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. His business is built on "trust, love, respect, and ethics and values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Rechanneling Sexual Energy**: Advanced [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] schools teach methods to control sexual energy and rechannel it into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. A simple [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | yoga]] exercise involves visualizing lustful energy flowing up the spine into the brain with each breath, spreading through the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **[[Importance of spirituality over materialism | Spiritual Pleasures]]**: Svarish emphasizes that the greatest pleasures are mental and [[importance_of_spirituality_over_materialism | spiritual]], contrasting them with fleeting physical pleasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings from a Yogic Perspective

Svarish shares three core life learnings from his [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | yogic life]]:
1.  **Authenticity**: Be true to yourself, even when it's difficult, and don't be swayed by environment or peer pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
2.  **Self-Care**: Prioritize both physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This balance (e.g., gym and [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | yoga]]) fosters self-belief and continuous self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Being a People Person**: Effective people management is crucial for success, as employees often leave employers, not companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Cultivating compassion towards others naturally follows self-care and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

Svarish's daily [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] practice involves Anapana of Vipassana, focusing on normal, natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This practice helps bring one to the present moment, increasing focus in waking life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. An hour of [[concepts_of_spirituality_and_meditation | yoga]] daily can provide energy for 23 hours and reduce the need for excessive sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

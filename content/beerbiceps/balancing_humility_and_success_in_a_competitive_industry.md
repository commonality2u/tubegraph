The Chanchlani family emphasizes the profound importance of [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | humility]] and grounded values, particularly within the entertainment and business sectors. They believe that true [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | success]] isn't solely defined by financial gain or public recognition, but by one's ability to maintain a down-to-earth demeanor regardless of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Instilling Core Values

From a young age, the Chanchlani children, Ashish and Muskan, were taught that [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | success]] is paramount, even more so than money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Their upbringing fostered a strong sense of [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | humility]], which is considered their greatest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This is demonstrated by their respectful and loving interactions with everyone, from family members to household staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The parents instilled in them the mindset that one should "always be down to earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Even as their children gained fame, the parents consistently reminded them to remember their roots and who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This guidance aims to prevent the common pitfall where people might become "a little crazy after seeing money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## The Role of Experience in Humility

Ashish's own upbringing, where he worked from the age of 16-17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, significantly shaped his [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | personality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Unlike many "sheltered" rich kids who have everything provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, Ashish's early involvement in his father's business, including tasks like daily banking and introducing new technologies to multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, gave him a practical understanding of hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He actively contributed to the business, rather than being financially reliant on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Observing the fleeting nature of fame among film stars also taught Ashish that true [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | success]] and respect are tied to ongoing achievement rather than mere status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The "hunger for [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | success]]" is what helps maintain [[importance_of_humility_and_middle_class_values | humility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Navigating the Competitive Landscape

The parents' advice to their children emphasizes the importance of dedication and maintaining a disciplined life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. For young entrepreneurs, the mother advises that parents should allow their children to pursue their passions, giving them at least a year to prove themselves before imposing restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. She advocates for allowing children to "fly" and not tying them down with too many rules, which can lead to confusion about their life's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Parental Support and Guidance

*   **Unwavering Support:** The mother actively reviewed Ashish's early videos and provided support, recognizing his happiness in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>.
*   **Balancing Academics and Passion:** When Ashish considered leaving engineering, his father encouraged him to finish his studies while pursuing his passion for acting simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51">[07:51]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_college_and_entrepreneurship | balancing college and entrepreneurship]] and the role of education alongside passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.
*   **Obsession and Hard Work:** The parents acknowledge Ashish's intense dedication to his craft, even noting how he works through dialogue in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>. This level of obsession is seen as crucial, especially for those starting their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>.
*   **Learning from Role Models:** Ashish learned from his father the drive to create his own identity and stand on his own feet, despite coming from a well-established family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40">[10:40]</a>. Muskan notes her mother's consistent positivity and optimism, emphasizing that something good can always come out of every situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56">[10:56]</a>. She also learned from her father the principle of "never giving up" and always treating everyone with respect, regardless of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03">[11:03]</a>.

When choosing T-shirts with graphics, specific rules regarding color coordination can elevate your style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Adhering to these guidelines helps ensure a cohesive and appealing look.

## General Principles for Graphic T-Shirts

For graphic T-shirts, the ideal approach is to limit the number of colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **Two-Color Maximum**
    It is generally recommended to aim for a maximum of two colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This means one base color for the T-shirt and one simple color for the graphic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Examples include black graphics on a red T-shirt, blue on black, or white on green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Introducing a Third Color (Minimalist Approach)**
    If a graphic incorporates two colors, beyond the base color of the T-shirt, a third color should be used minimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This accent color is intended to "bring out the pattern as well as the natural base color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. An example is a white print on a black T-shirt with a minimal "pop of red" to highlight the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Common Mistakes

A significant mistake is choosing patterns where the third color is dominating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For instance, a red T-shirt with a white pattern can be "absolutely messed up" by a prominent blue pattern if the two colors on the pattern don't work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If you choose to wear three colors, the recommendation is to be minimalistic with the third color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Relation to T-Shirt Style and Age

Patterns and bright, colorful T-shirts tend to make the wearer appear younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This concept is part of the [[tshirt_maturity_scale_and_ageappropriate_dressing | T-shirt maturity scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While plain, dark, or white T-shirts contribute to a more mature look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, a bright, colorful T-shirt with many patterns will make you look very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Logos and Branding

In terms of [[importance_of_logos_and_branding_on_tshirts | logos and branding]], it is often advised to avoid T-shirts with prominent logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Logos, while a type of graphic, can draw attention and may lead to judgment based on brand perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. T-shirts generally "look good without any logo" as "simplicity is beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

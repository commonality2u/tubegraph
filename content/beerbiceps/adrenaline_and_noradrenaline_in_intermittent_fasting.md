[[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | Intermittent fasting]] (IF) impacts various hormonal systems in the body, including the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline, often referred to as "fight or flight hormones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Role of Adrenaline and Noradrenaline

When the body faces a difficult situation, such as a dog attacking, its automatic response is to release a significant amount of these hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Adrenaline and noradrenaline prepare the body to either fight or run away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Their key functions include:
*   Significantly increasing metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Making the individual very alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This effect is comparable to receiving a shot of caffeine or a natural pre-workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Contributing to a "charged up" feeling when their levels are elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Impact of [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | Intermittent Fasting]]

[[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | IF]] has been shown to improve the levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This increase remains within healthy limits while simultaneously promoting alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The elevated levels of these hormones contribute to several benefits attributed to [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | IF]]:
*   Improved reflexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   An overall feeling of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

In the context of [[Intermittent fasting benefits and science | IF]], the presence of these hormones helps to:
*   Improve the body's ability to build muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Increase the rate at which the body burns fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   Enhance [[nutrition_and_its_impact_on_focus | nutrient]] repartitioning, meaning the body uses food more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Improve body composition, leading to a lower fat percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The concepts of free will, fate, and [[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karma]] are deeply intertwined, suggesting a complex system where individual actions, predetermined events, and the consequences of past deeds continuously interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:10">[09:56:10]</a>.

## Free Will and Destiny: An Intertwined Reality

The question of whether reality is entirely an outcome of higher beings' wills or if simpler beings also contribute is addressed by suggesting that everyone contributes at their own level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:54">[06:00:54]</a>. This rephrases the fundamental question of [[the_influence_of_astrological_charts_and_destiny_on_life | destiny]] versus free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:02">[06:09:02]</a>.

A parable illustrates this dynamic:
> A young boy asks a saint about free will and destiny. The saint tells him to stand on one leg, which he does (an act of free will). When asked if he can then stand on his *other* leg, the boy says no, or he will fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. The saint explains that the initial action created [[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karma]], and now the reaction is a constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

This highlights a constant feedback loop based on present actions, past deeds, and "samskaras" (tendencies carried from past births) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. However, this is not entirely fixed; effort can constantly modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

Certain aspects of life, known as "Dr Karmas" in [[the_influence_of_astrological_charts_and_destiny_on_life | Jyotish]], may be fixed, such as the moment and circumstances of death, decided at birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Other circumstances, like work, residence, and friendships, are more fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The outcome is a product of an individual's ongoing activity interacting with the momentum of [[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

Nature grants intelligence and judgment, expecting individuals to act upon them rather than ponder predestination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. For a select few whose minds have expanded through sadhana (spiritual practice), nature poses deeper questions about other graded forms of reality and predestination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

## Dreams as Manifestations of Reality

Dreams can serve as a link to various levels of reality, offering insights into what might manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>:
*   **Subconscious Dreams** (approx. 60%): Junk, reflecting daily observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **Conscious Reality Dreams**: Subconscious mind trying to communicate truths the conscious mind refuses to acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Astral Plane Dreams**: Accurate, specific details about events that will happen quickly (within days or a month) and can often be changed by corrective measures (e.g., precautions against an accident) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Plane Dreams (Rarest)**: From realms of gods and higher realities where ignorance is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. These take years to manifest but are unchangeable once conceived in that realm, acting as executed events merely waiting to appear here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

Understanding which realm a dream originates from is crucial for interpreting its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. Animals in dreams can be metaphorical representations from the subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

## The Human "Playground": A Realm of Possibilities

The Earth is described as a "playground of possibilities," where all shades of good and evil are allowed to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is a place to determine what one wants to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22">[53:22]</a>. The governing principle of this playground is the law of [[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karma]], where free will exists, but consequences are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29">[53:29]</a>.

### Reincarnation of Beings
Souls from lower realms can reincarnate on Earth, often manifesting evil tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historical figures like Stalin are cited as examples of such reincarnated "Asuras" (demons) who caused immense damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The greater the evil, the greater the damage it inflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These beings might influence humans with deep cravings for money, sex, or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Even evil beings engage in sadhana (spiritual practice) to gain power, as seen with Asuras in Hindu scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They pray for specific powers, and there are gods who exist independently of human morality and may grant such prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The world is a constant comparison, with all aspects of duality present, from the darkest to the purest shades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Conversely, higher beings, such as divine musicians (Gandharvas), can also be born on Earth, manifesting as geniuses in their respective fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Due to the "Maya" (deluding force) of the Goddess, they often do not remember their origins and may face adjustment issues in human life, sometimes exhibiting difficult behaviors or mental disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite personal struggles, their innate talent allows them to produce masterpieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The purpose of such births is often for advancement, driven by desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This realm facilitates rapid growth, allowing for significant changes in [[the_influence_of_astrological_charts_and_destiny_on_life | destiny]] over a few lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Transcendence and Spiritual Evolution

The ultimate goal for many is to transcend suffering entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which is not possible by merely existing in the human playground due to inherent pain, including at the moment of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Upasana (worship) of deities allows individuals to eventually transcend the qualities that cause suffering and become reflections of the deities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This is a journey of spiritual evolution where dedication and practice can "burn" [[karma_and_its_impact_on_lifes_success_and_outcomes | Karmas]] and transform the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

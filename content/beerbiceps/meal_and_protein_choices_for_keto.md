The [[full_day_of_eating_on_a_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is not a fixed plan, as calories need to be reduced every subsequent week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Initially, consuming "super greasy" food is acceptable, provided overall daily carbohydrates remain below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, fat intake must eventually be reduced to ensure the dieter stays under their maintenance calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The meal plan discussed here is more suitable for the later stages of keto, when calories are lower, meaning food can be slightly oily but not "extra greasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Daily Meal Structure and Protein Selection

Individuals following a [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] typically experience a drop in appetite, making it less feasible to consume as many meals as on other diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The goal is to keep the stomach full before workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Breakfast

A common breakfast choice on the [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] is a basic protein shake with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While some dairy can be afforded, for an ideal ketogenic state, protein shakes are consumed with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Isolate protein supplements are recommended due to their low carb and calorie content, and faster absorption compared to whey protein concentrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Though isolates are more expensive, whey protein concentrates can still be used while on keto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Lunch

A simple and filling lunch option is 100-150 grams of tawa-fried chicken breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This involves cutting chicken breast lengthwise, marinating it in spices, and frying it on a hot cast iron skillet with a small amount of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Pre-Workout Meal

Approximately an hour before a [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | keto-fueled workout]], a simple four-egg omelet cooked with minimal oil is a preferred meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It's important to remember that egg yolks provide significant fat, so excessive oil should be avoided to stay within calorie limits and burn fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While traditionally carbs are recommended for workout fuel, the goal on keto is simply to keep the stomach full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Post-Workout

After an intense [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | keto-fueled workout]], a protein shake with water is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Dinner - Essential Vegetables

Maintaining the 20-gram daily carb limit on the [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] is crucial, and the source of these carbs matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It's ideal to fill the carb allowance with green leafy vegetables rather than cheese or dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A stir-fry of lettuce, cabbage, and spinach with garlic and curry leaves is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Carbs from all ingredients, including garlic pods, must be meticulously counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Consuming these vegetables is vital to prevent deficiencies and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Dinner - Protein Sources

Seafood is a beneficial dinner option during ketosis, aiding in muscle recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. An example is grilled baby palm with extra virgin olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It's important to vary protein sources in a high-protein diet for different benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Optional Late-Night Meal

For those who feel hungry at night, lamb seek kebabs made from red meat can be an optional late-night meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While red meat shouldn't ideally be consumed daily, it's permissible on a [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] due to the allowance for extra fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Considerations for the Ketogenic Diet

A [[full_day_of_eating_on_a_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] requires strong psychological resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with a strong affinity for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. For individuals whose primary fitness goal is weight loss, an easier and more practical alternative might be other diet plans that don't restrict carbohydrates as severely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This article explores various aspects of penile health, focusing on surgical procedures, their implications, and the biological factors influencing male sexual function. Dr. Rajesh Tanja, a urologist and andrologist, shares insights from his extensive experience in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:20">[06:13:20]</a>.

## The Role of a Urologist
A urologist is often described as the "plumber of the trade," dealing with the reservoirs (bladder), valves, and conduits (urethra) of the urinary and reproductive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:38">[02:27:38]</a>. The focus is on both the structure and function of these organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:20">[07:55:20]</a>.

## Penile Replantation: A Case Study
Dr. Tanja recounts a remarkable case from 1999 or 2000 involving a gentleman suffering from schizophrenia who detached his penis with a blade and discarded it in a toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:27">[08:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:47">[08:48:47]</a>.

### Immediate Action and Surgical Protocol
Upon receiving the detached organ, Dr. Tanja instructed the patient's brother to place it in saline water, wrap it with cold ice, and bring it to the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:04">[08:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:49">[16:47:49]</a>. The patient's body was bleeding profusely due to the high vascularity of the penis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:33">[16:57:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:19">[18:54:19]</a>.

The surgical steps included:
*   **Anesthesia:** The patient was administered anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:21">[18:45:21]</a>.
*   **Clamping Vessels:** Identifying and clamping individual bleeding arteries to control the "fountain of blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:37">[19:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:13">[19:39:13]</a>.
*   **Cleaning and Sterilization:** Washing the detached organ to remove dirt and dipping it in a wide-spectrum antibiotic solution to kill germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. The spongy structure of the penis allows it to absorb the antibiotic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:03">[21:11:03]</a>.
*   **Reattachment:** Stitching each artery, vein, and the layers of the penis, including the urethra (urinary tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:46">[21:30:46]</a>. The penis fundamentally consists of three structures: two cylinders for erection and a third spongy body housing the urethra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:17">[21:46:17]</a>. This process is akin to "plumbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.

The surgery lasted four and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:50">[22:49:50]</a>. Today, with advancements like microscopes, finer instruments, and suture materials, such a surgery might be shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:18">[23:02:18]</a>.

### Post-Surgery and Recovery
*   **Mental State:** The patient was given injectable psychotropic drugs to keep him calm and evaluated by a psychiatrist immediately after waking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:12">[25:19:12]</a>.
*   **Doctor's Approach:** Dr. Tanja focused on providing positive reinforcement and distraction, telling the patient he was "absolutely fine" and that the issue was fixed, with high probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. He emphasized that the healing process is driven by positivity, not negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The surgery was successful. The patient later got married and had two children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   **Nerve Regeneration:** While nerves were not explicitly repaired during the 1999 surgery due to lack of microscopy, the body's natural "nerve growth factor" allows nerves to regenerate, especially in younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:17">[30:10:17]</a>. Nerves will grow and find other nerves to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

#### Potential Complications of Nerve Damage
If nerve cross-connection occurs, pleasurable sensations can turn into pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This is also seen in patients with conditions like diabetic neuropathies, where nerve endings become inflamed and interpret pleasure as pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. [[mens_sexual_health_and_performance_anxiety | Mens sexual health and performance anxiety]] can also stem from physical causes like diabetes affecting blood supply and sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

## Penile Implants
In cases of [[mens_sexual_health_and_performance_anxiety | erectile dysfunction]], particularly in Western literature, there has been a shift from psychological (psychogenic) to organic causes (physical issues with the organ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>. Dr. Tanja suggests this shift might be influenced by industry pressure, as implants are a profitable and easier solution than counseling patients or their partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:41">[51:17:41]</a>.

## Understanding the Prostate
The prostate is a walnut-sized organ located between the urinary bladder and the urethra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>. Its primary function is to produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a>.

### Prostate Enlargement (BPH)
*   **Causes and Symptoms:** As men age, typically beyond 40, hormonal changes can cause the prostate to proliferate (increase in size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:33">[01:59:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>. If the outer shell of the prostate is tight, it can compress the urethra, leading to symptoms like:
    *   Frequent desire to urinate (frequency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:29">[02:00:29]</a>
    *   Urgency (leaking before reaching the washroom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>
    *   Difficulty starting the stream (delayed stream) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:43">[02:00:43]</a>
    *   Prolonged or broken stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>
    *   Feeling of incomplete evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>
*   **Prevalence:** While all men over 40 may show histological (microscopic) changes of benign hyperplasia of the prostate (BPH), not all will experience clinical symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:28">[02:01:28]</a>. Some men can have a very large prostate (e.g., 200g, compared to normal 20g) without issues if the capsule is elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>.

### Prostate Examinations
*   **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE):** This involves a doctor inserting a lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. It should not hurt if performed correctly with proper technique, patient comfort, and distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>.
    *   **Purpose:** Historically, DRE was used to check for enlargement and exclude cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:43">[02:04:43]</a>. Cancerous tissue feels hard like a stone, unlike a normal, firm prostate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Modern Approach:** Today, blood tests like Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and MRIs are often used to detect prostate issues or cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:42">[02:05:42]</a>. DRE is now less common for initial screening but still crucial for surgeons to assess if a cancerous prostate is stuck to the rectum before robotic surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>.
*   **Ultrasound:** Can determine the prostate's weight, volume, shape, and the effect of any obstruction on the bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

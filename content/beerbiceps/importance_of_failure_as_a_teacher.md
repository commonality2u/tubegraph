Failure is considered both the worst and best part of life, serving as an exceptional teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While confidence often stems from [[success_and_the_meaning_of_life | success]], individuals will consistently question themselves when [[overcoming_setbacks_and_failures | going through failures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Failure as a Guide
Unlike [[success_and_the_meaning_of_life | success]], which is described as a very loud teacher, failure acts as a friend, philosopher, and guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Nothing significant can occur until one encounters failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## The Value of Early Failure
It is more beneficial to experience failure early in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Encountering significant failure later, particularly after the age of 50 or 60, can be unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. After an initial film, experiencing three subsequent unsuccessful films served as a significant [[personal_journeys_and_overcoming_failure | learning curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This experience instilled a practical understanding that success can change every Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, fostering an attitude of not being overconfident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The audience is the ultimate judge, possessing the most knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## Self-Motivation and Support Systems
Individuals must [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | motivate themselves]]; external support, even from a partner, may not always be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Self-support is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Tips for [[handling_stress_and_overcoming_failure | Overcoming Lost Confidence]]
When facing a loss of confidence, it is advisable to:
*   Maintain close relationships with family and parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   Surround oneself with friends who genuinely motivate and provide an honest perspective, rather than simply agreeing with everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   Actively choose one's company, as it significantly impacts personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   Cultivate mental sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   Engage in consistent reading and continuous learning, as acquired knowledge is never wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

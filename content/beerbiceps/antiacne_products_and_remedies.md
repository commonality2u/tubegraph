This article outlines a skincare routine and specific products to help prevent and treat [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]], blemishes, skin bumps, and irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The recommendations prioritize natural and herbal solutions over chemical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Foundational Skincare for Acne Prevention

Following a consistent skincare routine can help prevent various skin issues, including [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This routine applies to all skin types: oily, dry, or regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### [[face_washing_routine_and_products | Face Washing Routine]]

Proper [[face_washing_routine_and_products | face washing]] is crucial:
*   **Frequency**: Wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up or arriving at work/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you sweat a lot from cardio or sports, you can wash it a third time after your session, but ideally stick to twice daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Face Wash Type**: Opt for 100% herbal face washes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Be wary of large companies claiming to be Ayurvedic, as their products may only contain Ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Recommended brands include Khadi (budget-friendly), Kama Ayurveda, and Forest Essentials (more expensive), which are known for 100% natural, Ayurvedic herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Application Technique**:
    *   Wash your face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   Use a coin-sized portion of face wash or a slight amount of gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   Apply to three main regions in a circular motion:
        1.  **Cheeks**: Rub for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
        2.  **Chin and Neck**: Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
        3.  **T-area (forehead and nose)**: Rub in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Circular motion increases blood flow, rejuvenates skin, promotes growth, and cleans dirt better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Avoid rubbing up and down, as it can damage skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Be gentle but firm with strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   For herbal face washes, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to absorb nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Water Temperature**: Use room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature) water to wash off face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Avoid hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### [[moisturizers_and_natural_alternatives | Moisturizers and Natural Alternatives]]

Natural [[moisturizers_and_natural_alternatives | moisturizers]] are preferred over chemically made ones, which can clog pores, worsen [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]], and harm beneficial skin bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Chemically made moisturizers can act as disinfectants, destroying both good and bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

To apply natural moisturizers:
*   Always use a clean cotton ball to avoid transferring bacteria from hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Rose Water**: A natural disinfectant, apply twice a day (before heading out and before sleeping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice**: Apply once to twice a week, as it is stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It helps fight [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] and fade blemishes and [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If it stings too much, mix with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera**: This medicinal plant's pulp is a powerful moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Scrape out the gel from an aloe vera plant and apply it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It can cause a slight stinging sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For extremely dry skin or very bad [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]], apply aloe vera with lime juice once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Specific Antiacne Products (for Active Acne)

These products are for when [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] is active and painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

*   **Natural Herbal Oils**: Always try these first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Sweet almond oil, rosehip oil, or tea tree oil are low-density skin oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism**: They are absorbed by the pimple and reduce inflammation and redness, helping the pimple heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   **Avoid**: Do not use dense oils like coconut oil on your face, as they can clog pimples and worsen them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Antibiotics**: If herbal oils don't work, you can turn to antibiotics like Clinda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, **do not overuse antibiotics**, as long-term use can destroy the good bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Diet and Lifestyle Factors for Acne

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

### Diet
*   **Avoid**:
    *   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
    *   Junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
    *   Packaged fried snacks (often contain maida, dirty oils, and trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
    *   Overdoing one particular food type (e.g., non-vegetarian food, eggs, or vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   **Include**:
    *   More vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
    *   More fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>

### Lifestyle
*   **Reduce Stress**: High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin, aging, and skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Cortisol can also increase oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
    *   **Improve Sleep Hygiene**: Focus on the quality of your sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Meditate**: Both meditation and sleep can reduce stress and improve skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

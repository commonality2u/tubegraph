The activation of the [[Third Eye|third eye]] is powerful because it allows one to see beyond what is physically visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. When the [[Third Eye|third eye]] opens, it connects individuals to everything beyond physical sight, including worlds of darkness and lightness, dark and light energies, [[interaction with spirits and entities|spirits]], ghosts, entities, demonic energies, angels, [[Higher beings and other realms|ascended masters]], and the Divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

## Defining the Astral Plane
The astral plane is the realm between the human body and the [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|spiritual world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. The human body and the [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|spiritual body]] have different vibrational frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. The astral plane is not a separate physical location but rather exists "all here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Astral Travel and its Risks
Astral travel can involve the soul leaving the body, but it is crucial to ensure the physical safety of the body is taken care of before attempting any form of astral travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. The term "Walk-ins" refers to positive beings that temporarily replace one's body when the soul is absent, leaving when the soul returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

## Entities and Spirits in the Astral Plane
Different types of entities and [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|spirits]] exist within the astral plane:
*   **Low Vibrational Entities**: Dr. Tam encountered low vibrational entities and dark forces after her [[Third Eye|third eye]] opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. These entities, upon sensing one's ability to see, hear, or help them, may try to "engulf" or influence the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Stuck Souls**: Souls can become stuck in the astral realm or are low vibrational, unable to reach enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>. They require a powerful, high-vibrational energy to move into the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>. These "stuck" [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|spirits]] feel suffering because they are neither here nor there, and no one can hear, see, or acknowledge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.
*   **Demonic Entities**: Some entities might appear demonic but may not intend harm unless provoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   **Tantrics (Negative)**: There are [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena|tantrics]] who are not in human form but attempt to capture souls and use their power for their own gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. These are "masters" on the dark side who have developed skills to complement their negative gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:12">[01:52:12]</a>. They can empower physical realm [[role_of_spirituality_and_witchcraft_in_paranormal_phenomena|tantrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>.
*   **Angels and Demons**: Dr. Tam has witnessed "Cosmic Wars" — the "Mahabharata of the Angels and Demons" — happening in the energy above the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. In these conflicts, light always prevails, but it doesn't destroy the negative, only diminishes its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. This is because all beings, even lower vibrational ones, are considered part of God's frequency and are given opportunities for [[spiritual growth and the transition into a higher age|growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.

### Spirit Guides (Ancestors)
When a family member passes away, they can choose to be around their family as [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|Spirit guides]] to offer protection and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. They can be present with multiple family members simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. If a family member is suffering or making poor decisions, these [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife|Spirit guides]] may try to communicate through dreams or other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. If they cannot directly reach an individual, they will communicate through others who can pick up their frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. Sometimes, they remain due to an unfulfilled purpose or attachment to the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.

## Protection and Interaction
To protect oneself from negative entities or attacks during astral experiences:
*   **Healing Techniques**: Utilizing healing techniques and energy scanners can protect rooms and invoke divine light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.
*   **Cord Cutting**: Learning to cut cords is essential to prevent psychic or entity attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Soul Presence**: It is crucial to verify that one's authentic spirit is within the body, as its absence can lead to attacks or a "Walk-in" (where another entity temporarily occupies the body) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   **Non-Interference**: Demonic entities will not harm individuals unless they are provoked or if someone tries to capture or use them for negative purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>.
*   **Energy Protection**: Dr. Tam uses energy protection, sometimes called "Kavach" or "Suraksha Kavach," to prevent harm from negative entities. She can reduce their power by putting them in an energetic bubble through visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>. This process can be energetically draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>.

Powerful beings and lightworkers are often targeted by negative entities who wish to capture their energy for malevolent purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>.

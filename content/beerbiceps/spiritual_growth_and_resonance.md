[[Role of spirituality in personal growth | Spiritual growth]] is a continuous journey that influences one's connection with others and the divine. The state of an individual's [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] significantly impacts their relationships and experiences, often leading to a sense of resonance or discord.

## Resonance in Relationships and Spiritual States
When individuals are at a very high [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual state]], they tend to find others of a similar state, leading to a "resonance" and more mature interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, in the initial stages of [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual growth]], when individuals are still on their path and "not perfect," factors like ego can cause disturbances in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The romantic idea of a perfect partner is very rare in practice, and even some of the greatest yogis experienced challenging married lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Purpose of Life and Past Lives
For 99.99% of people, life is primarily a reaction to past actions rather than having a predetermined purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. A specific purpose emerges when an individual has held onto a particular aim for multiple lifetimes, such as desiring to be a great musician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. Similarly, those who achieve greatness in any field have likely wished for that greatness across two or three lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.

## Paths to Nirvana and Moksha
Achieving Nirvana or Moksha depends on the individual's preparation from past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It's possible to attain it in a single day if the preparation is sufficient, but it might take many lifetimes otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Sudden [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual awakenings]] can occur when circumstances align, often stemming from hard work in previous existences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>.

## Hard Work and Spiritual Practice (Sadhana)
Genuine [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] is never achieved without hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. When beginning a [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual practice]] (sadhana), the progress graph may initially show many experiences before flattening out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. This plateau, which can last for years or even lifetimes, is a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. Eventually, accumulated efforts can manifest as sudden, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. There are "no miracles" in [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | sadhana]], only processes rooted in sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

## The Individualistic Journey and Role of Pain
The [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual journey]] is fundamentally individualistic, often a "lonesome journey" that requires self-discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. While humanity is taught about love and unity, the path to spiritual happiness is often solitary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. Finding a partner with the same [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual wavelength]] is very rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.

Pain is an essential catalyst for [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | growth]]. One's "God or Divine" may deliberately force individuals through painful experiences until a "cry" for spiritual help is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. Without experiencing pain, it's difficult to transcend the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. Pain prepares the mind and body to handle the intense energies encountered in higher spiritual realms, fostering detachment from life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Community and Support in Early Stages
Despite the individualistic nature of the journey, having a community or "tribe" of friends engaged in a similar [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual journey]] is crucial in the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. This provides mutual support, allowing individuals to discuss their [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | sadhana]], console each other during difficulties, and maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

## The "Soul's Cry" and Divine Response
A profound turning point in [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] occurs when the soul becomes "tired of Maya" (illusion or attachment to the world) and experiences a "visceral guttural cry for help" from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. This earnest desire for something beyond the mundane cycle of pleasure and pain prompts the divine, such as Bhairava, to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. The divine will then reveal realities beyond the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. However, to advance, one must leave behind previous stages, just as one leaves Class 9 to go to Class 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>.

## Transcending Ego and Material Desires
The human heart harbors all sorts of desires, and people are often motivated by desires they are not consciously aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>. Krishna's teaching in the Gita highlights that deep-seated material desires can lead a yogi who doesn't succeed in a lifetime to be reborn in splendor, only to be distracted from their [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual path]] by that material comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>. Material existence has its own charm, and Maya is very strong, capable of pulling individuals away from their [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>.

Ego, defined as the sense of "I-ness" and attachment to one's identity (name, family, relationships), is the fundamental root of an individual's functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:44">[01:57:44]</a>. Without ego, an individual would be dysfunctional or end up in a mental institution if they lack sufficient [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual depth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:22">[01:58:22]</a>. The [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual goal]] is to transcend the ego, not eliminate it, as the ego individualizes and limits connection to higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>.

In a state of Nirvana, the normal ego is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:49">[01:58:49]</a>. While Nirvana is often understood as an "extinction" or "finish" of the system, a small percentage of individuals who attain this state may not extinguish themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:03">[01:56:03]</a>. Instead, a higher identity, perhaps of a deity, can enter them, allowing them to remain in this realm if Nature has a plan for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>.

## Judging Spiritual Potential
One can observe a person's physical structure, such as the weight of their hands, to discern their [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | spiritual potential]] and appropriate path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a great Kali upasaka, would minutely judge individuals seeking spiritual guidance based on their physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>. Such physical signs (`lakshanas`) indicate whether the body can sustain the intense energies of higher spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.

## Karma and Repercussions
Harming any living entity can have repercussions, but harming snakes, especially poisonous ones, is particularly problematic and can invite troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. In [[karmic_lessons_and_spiritual_growth | astrology]], `Naga Dosha` or `Sarpa Dosha` in a horoscope, often triggered by past actions like killing snakes, can cause friction in life, difficulties in marriage, or conceiving children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>. Killing snakes is considered a very heavy form of [[karmic_lessons_and_spiritual_growth | karma]], with guaranteed repercussions, if not immediately, then at the appropriate time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Bhairava and Accelerated Spiritual Transformation
Bhairava is an aspect of Shiva that is more active and closer to the human realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:46">[02:12:46]</a>. He responds quickly if certain parameters are met in an individual, and his `Vidya` (teaching) makes individuals fearless by forcing them to face their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:34">[02:32:34]</a>. He acts like a military trainer, putting individuals directly into challenging situations so they become immune to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:44">[02:32:44]</a>.

Bhairava's blessings are described as pulling an individual out of negative situations and directing them towards [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>. Honesty is crucial when worshipping Bhairava; one must express all flaws and weaknesses without pretense to receive his aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>.

The ultimate blessing from Bhairava comes at an advanced stage, where he can teach Tantras that no one else in the world can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:10]</a>. He holds the keys to success in Devi [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | upasana]], guiding individuals to the ultimate stages of [[spiritual_progress_and_transformation | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

**Vatuka Bhairava**: A child-like form of Bhairava, considered a son of Kali, tasked with protecting the practitioner from all troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:13">[02:19:13]</a>. Vatuka Bhairava responds very fast, requiring an emotional connection and gratitude from the devotee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:53">[02:19:53]</a>. Simple practices like chanting his mantra or listening to the Bhairava Chalisa can initiate his blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:09">[02:37:09]</a>.

## Stages and Realms of Spirituality
Kashmir Shaivism describes 36 `Tattvas` (stages of realities) beyond the 24 `Tattvas` identified in Sankhya philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. Even beyond Maya, there are deeper layers of spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>. The ultimate divine, `Adi Shakti` or `Parabhava`, cannot be imagined, transcending human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>.

Higher spiritual realms involve dramatically altered conceptions of time and the body's aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:56">[01:38:56]</a>. These realms are the "playground" of very rare and advanced practitioners, often found in isolated parts of the Himalayas or the depths of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

There are more than the commonly known six chakras, with additional "buds" that are not functional in most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. Through Kundalini power and deity `upasana`, these can be activated, leading to a `adesh` (command) from a `Divine Guru` who operates in higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>.

The concept of Nirvana is very high but can also be a "door to some other Realms of spirituality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>. In the highest realms, the conception of time changes, and beings are not physical; their level is beyond human imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.

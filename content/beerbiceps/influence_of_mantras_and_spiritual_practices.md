When an individual achieves a very high [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual state]], they find a resonance with others of a similar state, indicating a certain degree of matching and maturity in their connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, in the initial stages of [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual growth]], human relationships, such as marriage, can be disturbed by ego and other factors, making the idea of a "perfect partner" practically rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Even some of the greatest yogis had very difficult married lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Peculiar Heart and Desire
The human heart is described as peculiar, possessing all sorts of desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To truly understand a person's secret motivations, it's advised to observe their actions rather than their words, as people may not be consciously aware of their underlying desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This applies even to those claiming to seek spirituality; their energy may not align with their stated goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Power of Upasana (Worship)
[[the_significance_of_meditation_prayer_and_spiritual_practices | Upasana]], or worship, is likened to a love affair with the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. In its initial stages, it can feel one-sided as one tries to please a deity who may not seem interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This devotion is often a continuation of practices from past lives, drawing individuals naturally back to the spiritual path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Specific lunar days (tithis) are important in *upasana* as deities' energies become more active on those days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. For instance, Bhava's energy is most active on Krishna Paksha Ashtami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Forms of Contemplation
[[the_significance_of_meditation_prayer_and_spiritual_practices | Spiritual practices]] for contemplation include:
*   Chanting mantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | Meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   Performing rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   Drawing yantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>

The goal of these [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | spiritual practices]] is to connect with the energy of the deity, hoping they will "take notice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The time it takes for a deity to respond is subjective and depends on the *sadhak* (practitioner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Past lives contribute to one's natural tendency towards a specific deity, creating an intuitive connection even in unfamiliar cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### The Role of Hard Work and Discipline
Genuine [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] is never achieved without hard work, often spanning multiple lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Initially, a practitioner might experience a surge of experiences, but this can be followed by a plateau where little seems to happen, testing one's [[importance_of_spiritual_discipline | spiritual discipline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This period of sustained effort, even without immediate results, is crucial before a sudden breakthrough occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Nature of Deities and Manifestation
Deities are fundamentally formless energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. They do not have a physical solid presence but can manifest as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. They generally prefer not to enter the physical plane as it curtails their powers and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. The common images of deities are inspired by them onto the minds of Rishis and great masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Deities like Shiva, Ganesha, and Hanuman have their own domains and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Each great deity can manifest as the Supreme being for their worshipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. They are considered eternal and would exist even if all life on Earth perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Evolution of Consciousness
The creation process involves the ultimate Divine curtailing itself to manifest as deities and then the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Humans are seen as a "middle creature" with the potential to go downwards to darker realms or upwards to manifest divine qualities, even in flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Reaching the level of gods is theoretically possible but rarely achieved in practice due to various factors beyond individual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## The Influence of Mantras
[[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_Tantra | Mantras]], especially *bija mantras* (seed sounds like "Hreem"), are heard by Rishis and possess specific potency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>. Certain *bija mantras*, like Hreem, are considered Maya Bija because they destroy illusions and provide a vision beyond Maya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>. The *bija mantras* are powerful and can lead to significant positive material growth and clarity of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:55">[02:25:55]</a>. Another *bija*, "Phat," is used to stop negative influences or end negative situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:43">[02:27:43]</a>. The sound of a mantra is believed to cause movement in one's life, guiding their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a>.

## The Role of Bhava (Kalabhairava)
Bhava is described as a terrifying form of Shiva, representing unconditioned truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. He is the force that brings individuals face-to-face with truths they may be avoiding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
His *Vidya* (knowledge) makes individuals [[spiritual_practices_and_facing_fear | fearless]] by forcing them to confront their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. This process can be intense, leading to emotional detachment or "blunting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. When a soul is tired of the illusions (*Maya*) of the world, a deep, visceral cry for help emerges, to which Bhava responds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

### Forms and Characteristics of Bhava
*   **Kalabhairava**: Emerged from Shiva's anger, embodying an aggressive, active form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. He is the lord of spirits (*bhutesha*) and is associated with cremation grounds and elements rejected by society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:12">[02:18:12]</a>. Varanasi is considered his permanent residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>. He holds the keys to deeper Tantra knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:10]</a>.
*   **Vatukabhairava**: A child-like form of Bhava, considered a son of Kali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:04">[02:19:04]</a>. He is tasked with protecting the *upasaka* from all kinds of trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:22">[02:19:22]</a>. Vatuka Bhava is the fastest to respond among the forms of Bhava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:42">[02:19:42]</a>, but requires emotional connection and honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:53">[02:19:53]</a>.
*   **Guardianship**: Bhava is known as Chetrapala, the guardian of spaces, similar to a loyal dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>. He fiercely guards his *upasaka* and can pull them out of negative pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:11">[02:05:11]</a>.

### Honesty in Worship
When worshipping Bhava, it's crucial to be completely honest, revealing all flaws and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>. He detests pretense; speaking openly and without disguise is key to receiving his response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>.

## The Journey of [[spiritual_practices_and_facing_fear | Spiritual Growth]]
A [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | spiritual journey]] is often described as individualistic and lonesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. While rare, finding a partner of the same spiritual wavelength is possible, but general societal expectations around marriage often clash with the path of [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Historically, many great yogis had difficult married lives, suggesting that discomfort or dissatisfaction with the material world is sometimes a necessary catalyst for deeper spiritual pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Pain is an unavoidable part of [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual growth]], as it strengthens the mind and body to handle higher energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.

### Importance of Spiritual Community
Having a community or group of friends on a similar [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | spiritual journey]] is very important, especially in the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. Sharing struggles and motivating each other helps maintain [[importance_of_spiritual_discipline | discipline]] and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

## Beyond Nirvana
The traditional understanding of *Moksha* (liberation) and *Nirvana* as the ultimate end of existence is a simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:11">[01:55:11]</a>. While most individuals might achieve an extinction of their ego and release from the system, a small percentage can achieve Nirvana and yet not extinguish themselves, retaining a connection to the world with a higher identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>. These individuals are guided by Nature's higher plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>.

Higher spiritual realms transcend normal human comprehension of time, space, and even typical notions of Nirvāna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:56">[01:38:56]</a>. These realms are the "playground" for extremely rare and highly evolved beings, often in isolated locations like the Himalayas or the depths of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>.

## Practical Application of [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | Spiritual Practices]]
A simple and effective mantra for Bhava is "Om Batukaya Namah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>. This mantra is accessible for those living in society and can lead to [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual power]] and material benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:52">[02:21:52]</a>. Listening to or chanting the Bhava Chalisa can also bring significant positive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[02:31:16]</a>.

To begin, one can:
*   Sit in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:09">[02:37:09]</a>.
*   Light incense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:28">[02:37:28]</a>.
*   Offer food (Bhoga), especially items made of jaggery or urad dal, or even home-cooked meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>.
*   Regularly express gratitude to the deity for help received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

Bhava is strict, but if an individual takes one step towards him, he will take two steps towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>. While [[spiritual_practices_and_meditation | spiritual practices]] may sometimes start with negative experiences, these are often meant to prevent larger problems or reduce karmic repercussions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.

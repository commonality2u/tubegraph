The discourse surrounding India's struggle for independence has often been presented with a "linear, simplistic, monochromatic view," primarily highlighting the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. However, a parallel narrative of armed resistance, championed by revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and V.D. Savarkar, played a significant, though often downplayed, role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

## Unveiling Hidden History

Many young Indians feel that their education system has taught them "wrong history" or "irrelevant history," overlooking crucial aspects of the freedom struggle and ancient Indian history that didn't make it into textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This podcast aims to unveil this hidden history, particularly concerning the [[Revision of Indian Freedom Movement history | Indian Freedom Movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### The Missing Narrative of Revolutionaries
The notion that India gained independence solely through non-violence is challenged by historical accounts that point to a continuous chain of armed resistance from 1857 until 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This perspective suggests that violent uprisings often preceded any reforms or concessions from the British, including eventual freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Clement Attlee, the British Prime Minister during India's independence, reportedly stated in the 1950s that the heroics of the Indian National Army (INA) and the [[Significance of forgotten events like the 1946 Naval Mutiny | Naval Mutiny of 1946]] were key reasons for Britain's departure, rather than Gandhi's non-violent movement, which he called "minimal" in impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Bhagat Singh

Bhagat Singh, along with Baga Jatin and Jinsdas, has been controversially labeled as "revolutionary terrorist" in Delhi University textbooks and UPSC books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This term, originally coined by Colonial Masters, has drawn protests from Bhagat Singh's descendants, who argue its continued use, especially in the context of modern terrorism, unfairly equates him with today's terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Bhagat Singh was a significant figure among the revolutionaries, instrumental in publishing the second edition of V.D. Savarkar's influential book on the 1857 Uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## V.D. Savarkar

V.D. Savarkar is a central figure in the revolutionary movement, often subject to debate and misrepresentation.
He is known for:
*   **Purna Swaraj:** As early as 1905, while a student at Fergusson College in Pune, Savarkar called for complete independence ("Purna Swaraj") and led the first student bonfire of foreign clothes, for which he was rusticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This contrasted with the Congress's approach of "peace meal negotiations" for dominion status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Abhinav Bharat:** He founded India's first organized secret society, initially called Mitra Mela, which later became Abhinav Bharat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Leadership in London:** For five years as a law student in London, he actively led the revolutionary movement, associating with figures like Shyamji Krishna Varma and Madame Bhikaji Cama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
*   **"The First War of Indian Independence":** Savarkar authored a seminal book on the 1857 Uprising, famously terming it "the first war of Indian independence" â€“ a term the British disparagingly called the "sepoy mutiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>. This book became a "Bhagat Gita" for future revolutionaries, influencing figures like Bhagat Singh, Rash Behari Bose, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

### Imprisonment and Sacrifice
Savarkar endured 14 years of imprisonment: 12 years in Kalapani (the Cellular Jail in Andaman) and 2 years in Indian mainland jails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. After his release, he spent 13 years under house arrest in Ratnagiri, unable to leave the district's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. His law and graduation degrees were revoked, and his family property was confiscated, forcing the women of his family to beg for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### The Kalapani Experience
Kalapani was an "Indian Bastille," a horrific prison where revolutionaries faced unspeakable tortures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. Prisoners were denied basic human rights, including good food, drinking water, and toilet facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Punishments included standing handcuffed for weeks and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. The *kolu* (oil extraction) punishment forced prisoners, including Savarkar, to replace bullocks and extract 30 pounds of oil daily in the scorching heat of Port Blair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Failure to meet quotas resulted in whiplashing and denial of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. Many prisoners, often young men in their teens or early twenties, committed suicide, and some went mad, leading the British to open an asylum nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

Savarkar, a prolific poet, would compose poetry on cell walls using his nails and charcoal; the jailers would whitewash the walls to spite him, but he memorized over 4,000 lines of poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Controversies and Accusations

#### Mercy Petitions
Critics often point to Savarkar's "mercy petitions" to the British as evidence of betrayal or being a "stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. However, historian Vikram Sampath clarifies that these were common applications filed by many political prisoners, akin to bail applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. His petitions contained no apologies; British records confirm he showed "no regret or repentance or remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. He often filed petitions on behalf of other younger, less educated revolutionaries, stating he would be equally pleased if his name was removed and others were released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

#### [[Controversies surrounding Gandhi and Nehru | Association with Nathuram Godse]]
Savarkar's past affiliation with Nathuram Godse, Gandhi's assassin, led to his implication in the assassination case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. Godse, who served as Savarkar's secretary and confidant, and was a prominent member of the Hindu Mahasabha's youth wing, later broke away from Savarkar, who had become more pacifist closer to independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

Godse's motivation stemmed from anger over the Partition and perceived inaction by Gandhi, particularly Gandhi's call for the Indian government to pay 50 crores to Pakistan at a time when Pakistani forces were invading Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. Godse viewed Gandhi as a "national security threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

Despite allegations, the trial court in 1948 honorably exonerated Savarkar due to lack of evidence, and this was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018, which declared claims of his involvement in the conspiracy "null and void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

#### [[Religious and Philosophical Evolution in India | Hindutva]]
Savarkar's concept of "Hindutva," outlined in his book *Essentials of Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?* written while he was in jail, is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. He explicitly stated it had "nothing to do with the theological aspects of Hinduism as a religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Instead, Hindutva was a "cultural and national identity marker," defining those who considered India ("Hindustan") as their *punyabhoomi* (holy land) and *pitrubhoomi* (ancestral land), regardless of their religious beliefs (e.g., Jain, Muslim, Parsi, Sikh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. His work in Ratnagiri was focused on caste eradication, not just untouchability, to unify Hindu society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

### Post-Independence Narrative Control
After independence, the ruling establishment, particularly under [[Controversies surrounding Gandhi and Nehru | Jawaharlal Nehru]], sought to promote a specific viewpoint of the freedom struggle, suppressing alternative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Historians who did not align with this "line" faced professional repercussions, losing jobs, patronage, and awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. For example, R.C. Majumdar, commissioned to write the official history of the freedom struggle, was dismissed for wanting to be critical of Gandhi's "flip-flop policies" and including accounts of his failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

The branding of figures like Mahatma Gandhi and [[Controversies surrounding Gandhi and Nehru | Jawaharlal Nehru]] in the global narrative was influenced by geopolitical powers, particularly Britain and America, who preferred a portrayal of India gaining freedom peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This narrative served to depict former Colonial Masters in a "good light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

Consequently, many who led armed struggles, despite sacrificing their lives, were marginalized and labeled as "revolutionary terrorists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Figures like Savarkar became "persona non grata," and any discussion of them, even through art, was stifled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Lata Mangeshkar's father, Master Dinanath Mangeshkar, lost his job at All India Radio in the 1960s for tuning and singing Savarkar's iconic Marathi poems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

Today, there is a renewed interest in these figures, driven by social media and a desire for "light" on suppressed facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. The prevailing narrative has been criticized for being "Delhi-centric" and ignoring the contributions of various dynasties and regions across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Learning from the Past

To build a stronger future, India needs a "Truth and Reconciliation" process with its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. This means honestly assessing the past, including atrocities and genocides, without fabricating or whitewashing events for political correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. Only by confronting these "unhealed energies" can a nation move forward with confidence and closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. Readers are encouraged to read diverse viewpoints and form their own informed opinions on historical figures and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

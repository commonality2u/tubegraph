Priyanka Chopra Jonas emphasizes the critical importance of [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_mental_health_and_productivity | work-life balance]] for sustained success and personal well-being. This perspective has evolved from her younger years, where extreme dedication to work was romanticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Shifting Perspectives on Work
In her younger days, there was a prevailing belief that to be successful, one had to work continuously, even 24 hours a day, doing multiple projects without sleep or food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This idea suggested that the more a person pushed themselves to exhaustion, the more successful they would become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

However, as she has gained more life experience, Priyanka Chopra Jonas realized that having a **work-life balance** is "really important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. She reflects that the romanticization of work being tough and rough is a misconception; instead, work "can be your companion," "creative," and "something that gives you Joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Importance of Downtime
Taking breaks and having personal time is crucial for rejuvenation and motivation. Priyanka Chopra Jonas shared an experience of a recent trip to Turks and Caicos with her husband:
> "My phones were off. Me and my husband just by ourselves we spent time we walk walked on the beach we collected shells... and then I came back feeling rejuvenated feeling excited and really motivated to take my career forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

This demonstrates how dedicated downtime, away from professional demands, directly contributes to enhanced professional drive.

## Prioritizing Balance
For Priyanka Chopra Jonas, [[balancing_professional_life_and_personal_milestones | work-life balance]] is now "most important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She manages multiple professional verticals, including her business, production, writing, and acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. However, when she switches off from work:
*   She prioritizes being with her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   She enjoys being at home and watching movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   This clear separation allows her to return to work with renewed focus and capability to achieve even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

She rejects the notion of retiring early at 35 or 40 to simply "chill on a beach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Instead, she aims to integrate work into a joyful life, acknowledging her love for her job and the privilege of being in her position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This approach highlights her commitment to a sustainable career trajectory while maintaining personal fulfillment.

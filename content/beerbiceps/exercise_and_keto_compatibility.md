The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] requires careful calorie management and specific food choices, especially when combined with exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Adjusting Your Diet on Keto
Initially, when following the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], one can consume quite greasy food as long as daily carbohydrates remain below 20g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, to remain under maintenance calories and promote fat burning, fat intake must eventually be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The diet shown in the video focuses on the later stages of keto, where calories are lower and food is less greasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Appetite on Keto
One common experience on the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a significant drop in appetite, making it challenging to consume large amounts of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Pre-Workout Nutrition on Keto
Traditionally, a high-carb meal is recommended to fuel workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, during [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | keto]], this is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Recommended Meal**: A simple four-egg omelette cooked with minimal oil is suggested as a pre-workout meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Fat Intake**: Eggs provide significant fat through the yolks, so it's important not to overdo the oil to stay within calorie limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Purpose**: The primary goal is to keep the stomach full before a workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Adaptation**: Individuals accustomed to high-carb pre-workout meals might find the [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | keto lifestyle]] difficult at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Post-Workout Nutrition on Keto
After an intense [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | keto-fueled workout]], a protein shake with water is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Other Key Meals and Considerations
*   **Breakfast**: An isolate protein supplement mixed with water is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While dairy can be included in a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], water is preferred for an ideal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Isolate protein supplements are low in carbs and calories, and absorb faster than whey concentrates, though they are more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Whey protein concentrate can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Lunch**: A simple tawa fried chicken breast (100-150g) is a filling option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Recipes for such meals are available on the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Crucial Meal: Green Leafy Vegetables**: This is considered the most important part of the [[food_guidelines_for_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   **Carb Source**: The daily 20g carb limit should ideally be filled with green leafy vegetables like lettuce, cabbage, and spinach, stir-fried with garlic and curry leaves, rather than dairy or cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   **Tracking**: Every gram of carbs, even from garlic, must be counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   **Health Benefits**: Consuming these vegetables is crucial to prevent deficiencies and severe constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Dinner: Seafood**: Seafood is recommended for dinner during [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **Protein Variation**: Regularly changing protein sources is beneficial for a high-protein diet as different sources offer different benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Seafood specifically aids in [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | muscle recovery]], especially on [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. An example given is grilled baby pomfret with extra virgin olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Optional Late-Night Meal: Red Meat**: For those who get hungry at night, lamb seekh kebabs (red meat) can be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While daily consumption of red meat isn't ideal, the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] allows for the extra fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Challenges
For the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] to be effective, it should be followed for a minimum of 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It demands significant psychological strength to execute well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The [[benefits_and_downsides_of_ketosis | ketogenic diet]] is not for everyone, particularly individuals who have a strong affinity for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For general weight loss, other diet plans might be easier and more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

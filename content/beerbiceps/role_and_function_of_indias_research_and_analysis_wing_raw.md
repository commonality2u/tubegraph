The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), often referred to as RAW, is India's external intelligence agency. Former R&AW Chief, Vikram Sood, explains its origins, functions, and the evolving nature of intelligence gathering and national security.

## What is Intelligence?
Intelligence involves gathering information about an adversary, including their plans, intentions, abilities, and likely moves against India, to India's detriment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It encompasses both collecting factual data (hard intelligence) and making assessments based on that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Formation and Early History of R&AW
At India's Independence, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) was responsible for both internal and external intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. However, following the 1962 Chinese Invasion and the 1965 Pakistani invasion (which saw "Freedom Fighters" sent into Kashmir), the government realized that one organization could not effectively handle both internal and external threats with full devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Consequently, a new organization dedicated solely to external threats was deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) was officially created on September 21, 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Mr. R.N. Kao was appointed as its first head, serving for nine years and overseeing its establishment and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

R&AW's first major success came during the 1971 war with Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. R&AW assisted the liberation fighters of Bangladesh (Mukti Bahini) by training and equipping them to fight the Pakistani regular forces in Dhaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Types of Intelligence
*   **Hard Intelligence** involves documented evidence, audio recordings, imagery, and photographic proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Soft Intelligence** relies on information from human sources or "spies" who may not provide documented proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. In the past, this was constrained by slow communication methods, taking days or even a month for information to be delivered, potentially rendering it redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Topographical Intelligence** involves mapping the topography of neighboring countries, which historically required agents on the ground due to the lack of satellite imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

In the modern era, approximately 90% of intelligence comes from **open sources**, information available to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The art lies in combining this publicly available information with specialized intelligence to gain a "quantum jump" in understanding and predicting future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Examples of open sources include Google Maps and social media, which are also used by intelligence agencies for both collection and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Evolving Scope of Security
The meaning of security today is much wider than just military or political aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. It includes factors like demography, migrations (e.g., famine-induced movements posing security threats), and even water shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The biggest threat to a country is if its water supply is cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The Indus Water Treaty, for example, is adhered to by Pakistan because it offers a favorable deal, providing them with more water than they should get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. India needs to re-evaluate this treaty, aiming for a more balanced 50/50 distribution from the current 70/30 equation favoring Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Pakistan views any change to the treaty as an act of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

R&AW feeds its intelligence to the government and the [[indian_armys_exposure_and_global_perception | Indian military]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Life as an Intelligence Officer
Recruitment into R&AW, as experienced by Vikram Sood in 1972, sought talent from various fields, not just the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. A significant motivation for joining is the desire to work in this particular kind of field, alongside serving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

Intelligence officers maintain a cover story, often stating they work for the Cabinet Secretariat to avoid revealing their true profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This career is described as "extremely lonely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. Family members, such as a spouse, might know the general nature of the work, but children typically learn gradually over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Officers are taught to be "short and crisp" when speaking to important people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Espionage and Counter-Espionage
Espionage is defined as the art or business of spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Counter-espionage involves detecting and neutralizing an adversary's spy attack, potentially by turning their agents into double agents or feeding them false information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

Moles (spies within one's own organization) are difficult to spot, but signs might include excessive spending, being overly inquisitive about matters outside their purview, or outright betrayal by an adversary's source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. Theoretically, even a person at the top could be a double agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. Methods of information exchange include "dead letter boxes," where documents are left in a hidden location for another agent to retrieve without meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Public Perception and Media Portrayal
Bollywood movies like "Pathaan" or "Tiger" are criticized for being unrealistic depictions of R&AW's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Realistic spy narratives, like "Bridge of Spies" or the BBC series "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," portray a lonely life, dealing with actual facts, and intricate methods of information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## R&AW's Role in India's Modern Security Stance
India's perceived increased safety and "tiger's branding" on the world stage are attributed to the government's efforts to deliver on promises for the common man (e.g., digital transactions, gas connections, toilets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. Additionally, the government has reached out to global nations, improving relations, particularly with West Asian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

The Balakot airstrike after the Pulwama attack was a "message" that India is willing to retaliate, leading to a "different tune" since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This assertive stance gives India self-pride and confidence on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Unlike the 2008 Mumbai attacks, where India did nothing, a stronger reaction would be expected today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

Collaboration between R&AW and the [[indian_armys_exposure_and_global_perception | Indian military]] is essential, though differences in assessment of information can arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. R&AW acts as the supplier of information, while the military are the users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. The Kargil War of 1999, where India was initially "caught unawares," highlighted the need for vigilance and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

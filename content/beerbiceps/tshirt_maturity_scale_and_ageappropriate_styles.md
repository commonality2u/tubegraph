To elevate one's fashion sense from average to stylish, understanding the T-shirt maturity scale is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This scale categorizes T-shirts from "young" to "mature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Ideally, one should dress according to their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Understanding the Scale

If you are still in college, you can opt for a younger aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, if you are above the age of 22, it is generally recommended to lean towards a more mature appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Perceived Age

The perceived age of a T-shirt depends primarily on two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:

### Plain vs. Patterned T-shirts
T-shirts can either have a [[pattern_shirt_rules | pattern]] or be [[rules_for_graphic_designs_and_color_combinations_on_tshirts | plain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Color Choice
T-shirts can be bright and colorful, or dark or white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **Looking Older**: [[basic_shirt_colors_for_mens_wardrobe | Dark or white T-shirts]] tend to make you look older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. A dark, [[rules_for_graphic_designs_and_color_combinations_on_tshirts | plain T-shirt]] specifically contributes to a more mature look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Looking Younger**: Bright and colorful T-shirts with many [[pattern_shirt_rules | patterns]] make you appear younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Neutral Effect**:
    *   A dark T-shirt that includes a [[pattern_shirt_rules | pattern]] does not significantly make you look older or younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   Similarly, a [[rules_for_graphic_designs_and_color_combinations_on_tshirts | plain T-shirt]] that is bright in color also has a neutral effect on perceived age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Age-Specific Recommendations

*   **Above 22**: It is appropriate to dress higher on the maturity scale and aim for a slightly older look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **College Age**: You have the flexibility to look a bit younger by wearing [[basic_shirt_colors_for_mens_wardrobe | bright colors]] and incorporating more [[rules_for_graphic_designs_and_color_combinations_on_tshirts | graphics]] and [[pattern_shirt_rules | patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

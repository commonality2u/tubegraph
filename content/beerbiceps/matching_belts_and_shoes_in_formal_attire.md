In formal or office dressing, aligning your belt and shoes is a key element of a polished look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This simple rule contributes significantly to overall [[Formal dressing rules for men | formal dressing]] and ensures cohesion in an outfit.

## Belt Selection Rules

When choosing a belt for formal wear, there are a few strict guidelines:
*   **Material** Avoid cotton belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Always opt for a leather or faux leather belt that provides a "leathery feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Color Priority** Black and dark brown belts are highly versatile and stylish options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The Matching Rule

The fundamental rule for [[attention_to_detail_in_accessories_and_shoes | attention to detail]] in formal attire is to always match the color of your belt to the color of your shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   The colors do not need to be an exact match, but they should be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For example, light brown [[Importance of shoes in mens fashion | shoes]] can be paired with a dark brown belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

This coordination contributes to a sharper, more refined appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

[[Role and practice of Tantra and Sadhana | Kriya Yoga]] is a practice meaning "a technique" or "a practice" in the yoga Shastras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Specifically, Kriya Yoga refers to a set of teachings that originate from [[Principles of Krishna Consciousness and Meditation Practices | Sri Guru Babaji]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Yogananada Swami is credited with coining the term "Mahar Babaji" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, while the great Gorakhnath referred to him as "Sri Guru Babaji" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

Kriya Yoga is considered a systematic and methodical way of transcending the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. It is also believed to be one of the fastest forms of [[Spiritual practices and growth | spiritual advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## How Kriya Yoga Works
The practice involves raising one's awareness from the gross to the subtle, focusing attention on the spine, known as the Shushumna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. As awareness is taken through different parts of the spine, the mind becomes finer and finer, ultimately leading to an understanding of the origin of the human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

Through the practice of Kriya, human cells begin to change, becoming filled with more energy not ordinarily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This causes physical changes, making practitioners appear "uncanny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. Breathing also becomes slower and deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Additionally, [[Kundalini and Chakras | Prana]], or life energies, are released from energy centers within the body, which are normally not released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.

## [[Kundalini and Chakras | Kundalini]]
The term "Kundalini" is often avoided due to its widespread exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. In [[Tantric practices and mantras | Tantric texts]], it refers to the entire energy of the universe, known as "Parashakti," which is depicted as feminine creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

Kundalini operates first as sexual energy, as sex and Kundalini are interrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. This creative energy is responsible for creating another human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. After procreation, this energy does not dissipate; it resides at the bottom of the spine, in the lowest chakra called the Muladhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. Sexual excitement or enjoyment draws upon this same energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.

### Turning the Energy Around
A Yogi's practice involves controlling this energy and turning it around, making it ascend the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. When Kundalini or Shakti ascends the spine, it transforms into a spiritually creative energy, similar to how it acts as a physically creative energy through sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.

Methods to turn the energy around include:
*   **Kriya** (from [[Tantric practices and mantras | Yoga Tantra]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>
*   **Mantra Tantra** (Viya Upasana) through chanting sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>
*   A judicious combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>

### Requirements and Risks
The time it takes for [[Kundalini and Chakras | Kundalini]] to awaken and ascend varies greatly, depending on an individual's stage of spiritual growth and past life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Diligent practice with the understanding of needing to rise above the ordinary is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

It is generally better for the process to unfold slowly and maturely rather than suddenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. The energy is incredibly powerful, and if the body and mind are not prepared, individuals can become "semi-crazy," experiencing a sudden surge of energy they cannot place or control, leading to strange behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. In such cases, they may see or hear things, or feel their body shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. This highlights the importance of a stable and experienced [[Spiritual beliefs and practices in India | Guru]] who can provide proper preparation and guidance, as it is largely unexplored territory with potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

## Kundalini, Enlightenment, and Other States of Consciousness
According to the yoga Shastras, [[Principles of Krishna Consciousness and Meditation Practices | moksha]] or [[Kundalini and Chakras | Kundalini]] awakening generally occurs when the energy has risen and reached the Sahasrara (crown chakra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. However, there are instances where individuals achieve illumination without consciously practicing Kriya Yoga or other specific yoga forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. This happens when their mind becomes purified over many lifetimes, leading to an awakening of energy in specific centers, such as the Anahata (Heart Center), resulting in bliss and heightened awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. This can also occur by seeking one's true identity through self-inquiry, such as asking, "Who am I?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### The Pineal Gland and States of Consciousness
The pineal gland, often associated with the "third eye" in Western understanding, plays a role in the body's circadian rhythm, regulating sleep and wake cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. It produces melatonin, which contributes to feelings of well-being during deep meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

In Vedanta, the states of human consciousness are described as:
1.  Waking state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>
2.  Dream state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>
3.  Deep sleep (Shukti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>
4.  Turiya (beyond definition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>

Deep sleep is characterized by a lack of external recognition and internal cognition, yet it is associated with great bliss, though not consciously experienced at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The borderline between deep sleep and [[Kundalini and Chakras | Turiya]] is very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. If one could theoretically become aware within the deep sleep state, they would enter [[Kundalini and Chakras | Turiya]], an all-pervading state of blissfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

Focusing attention on the pineal gland area through meditation can facilitate the transition from deep sleep into Turiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. The pineal gland's hormone release can be controlled by the mind through thought, visualization, one-pointed attention, calming the mind, and equalizing the breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### Meditation as Described in the Gita
The oldest reference to [[Role and practice of Tantra and Sadhana | Kriya]] is found in the sixth chapter of the Gita, called Dhyana Yoga. Krishna instructs Arjuna:
> "Sit straight, keep your spine and head steady, fix your attention in the brow area (the center between your eyebrows, which leads to the pineal gland), then balance your breath and be free." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>

## The Purpose of [[Spiritual practices and growth | Spiritual Practice]]
The ultimate purpose of life is to recognize the divine element present in every living being, especially in human beings who can recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. This divine element is the essence of our being. By turning the mind around and looking within, one can find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>. The aim is to move from the ordinary to that which is beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a>.

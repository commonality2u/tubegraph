The [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is primarily a super low-carb diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. To execute it effectively, carbohydrate intake must be strictly controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Some studies suggest staying below 50g of carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, but personal experience indicates that a true [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] requires staying below 20g of carbohydrates per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

It's crucial to account for every single item consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, even small ingredients like garlic pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. The golden rule for achieving ketosis is to stay below 20g of overall carbs daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Additionally, ensure that the carbs consumed provide barely any sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Foods to Eat

Generally, food should be homemade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, ideally prepared by yourself, to maintain control over what you're eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

*   **Non-vegetarian options** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>:
    *   Red meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>
    *   Chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>
    *   Eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>
    *   Fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>

*   **Fats and Oils** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>: The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] allows for a high intake of fats from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
    *   Any oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>
    *   Ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>
    *   Coconut oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>
    *   Butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
    *   Animal fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>

*   **Vegetables** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>: Vegetables are crucial for nutrition and preventing constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. You must be selective about which vegetables to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
    *   Leafy greens: Spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, normal lettuce, red cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>
    *   Broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>
    *   Zucchini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>
    *   These selected vegetables should ideally make up most of your 20g carb allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Foods to Avoid (or Limit)

*   **Vegetarian Protein Sources (for Indians)**: Many vegetarian protein sources in India contain carbohydrates, making the [[introduction_to_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] difficult to execute for vegetarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **High-Sugar Vegetables**: Avoid vegetables with a slightly high sugar content if aiming for ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
    *   Onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>
    *   Tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>
    *   Bell peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
    *   Carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>
    *   Beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>
*   **Processed Foods**: Do not consume fruit or junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A general rule is to avoid anything processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
    *   Processed cheese (contains a lot of carbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>
    *   Paneer (contains carbohydrates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>
    *   Peanut butter (often processed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>
*   **Dairy**: For advanced ketosis, it's advised to completely avoid dairy products, as milk products generally contain some carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Nuts**: While healthy fat sources, nuts contain a substantial amount of carbohydrates. Keep nut intake very low to execute keto well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Sugar**: Even on refeed days, sugar must be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## Refeed Days (Carb Up Days)

Every 10 to 14 days, you can have a refeed day where you consume up to 400-500g of carbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. On these days, you must still avoid sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This can include "cheat meals" like rice or a burger made with bread, as long as sugar is omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This carbohydrate intake should happen only once every 10 to 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

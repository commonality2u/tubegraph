The [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a very strict, super low-carb eating plan aimed at fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For effective ketosis, the total daily carbohydrate intake should be kept below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It's crucial to meticulously track everything consumed, down to individual garlic pods, as even small amounts of carbohydrates can hinder the diet's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## General Guidelines

All food consumed on a ketogenic diet should be homemade, ideally prepared by yourself, to ensure complete control over ingredients and carbohydrate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Allowed Foods

### Protein Sources
Non-vegetarian options are generally permitted, and should ideally be homecooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. These include:
*   Red meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

### Fats
A significant amount of fat is allowed on the ketogenic diet, which helps make food more palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Acceptable fat sources include:
*   Various oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
*   Ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Coconut oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   Animal fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>

### Vegetables
[[incorporating_vegetables_for_nutrients_in_keto | Vegetables are vital]] for nutrition and to prevent constipation, but selection must be super selective due to their carbohydrate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The limited 20g carb allowance should prioritize these vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Recommended vegetables include:
*   Leafy greens:
    *   Spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    *   Cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    *   Iceberg lettuce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
    *   Normal lettuce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
    *   Red cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Zucchini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

## Foods to Avoid

Many foods commonly considered healthy or part of a regular diet must be avoided or severely restricted on a ketogenic diet due to their carbohydrate or sugar content.

### High-Sugar and Processed Foods
*   **Fruit and Junk Food**: These are strictly prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Sugary Carbs**: Any carbs consumed should contain "barely any sugar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This means avoiding items with even slightly high sugar content.
*   **Processed Foods**: As a general rule, avoid anything processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Specific Vegetables to Limit or Avoid
Due to their sugar content, certain common vegetables should be avoided for effective ketosis:
*   Onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Bell peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Almost all other vegetables not explicitly listed as allowed are considered "dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Dairy and Related Products
*   **Processed Cheese**: Contains a lot of carbs and can quickly put you out of ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Paneer and Milk Products**: Most milk products contain some carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To take ketosis to the next level, it's advised to completely avoid dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Other High-Carb Foods
*   **Nuts**: While a healthy fat source, nuts also contain a substantial amount of carbohydrates. Nut intake should be kept super low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Peanut Butter**: Often mistakenly thought to be keto-friendly, peanut butter should also be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Special Considerations

### Vegetarians
The ketogenic diet is particularly challenging for vegetarians in India due to the inherent carbohydrate content found in most vegetarian [[protein_sources_and_their_role_in_keto | protein sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### [[concept_of_refeed_days_in_ketogenic_diet | Refeed Days]]
Every 10 to 14 days, a refeed day (or carb-up day) is allowed, where carbohydrate intake can go up to 400-500 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. However, even on these days, it's crucial to avoid sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Acceptable cheat meals on refeed days could include rice or a burger made with bread, as long as sugar is omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

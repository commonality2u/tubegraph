The [[IPL]] (Indian Premier League) has seen significant growth and continues to be a central part of the cricketing landscape. Discussions around its future and the introduction of a Women's [[IPL]] highlight the sport's evolving dynamics in India.

## Growth and Current Status of the IPL
The [[IPL]] has expanded, increasing from eight to ten teams this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This growth is a testament to cricket's immense popularity in India, which has been booming since the 1983 World Cup win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Since 1996, cricket stadiums in India have consistently seen full attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, a trend that continues with the [[IPL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. India is considered the international hub of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

The professionalism and fan experience in [[cricketing_environment_and_team_dynamics | cricket]], particularly through the [[IPL]], have significantly improved, drawing parallels to global sports like football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Future of the IPL
While there's a desire among fans to see the [[IPL]] expand further into an NBA-style league with more teams, the current structure faces a fundamental limitation: the international cricket window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Unlike the NBA, international matches for the Indian team, including bilaterals, Tests, and T20s, occupy significant periods throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

Sourav Ganguly believes that the current balance of the [[IPL]] is good, as it prioritizes the honor of playing for the country above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Women's IPL
The Women's [[IPL]] is confirmed and is set to launch next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The organization is actively in the process of getting it ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

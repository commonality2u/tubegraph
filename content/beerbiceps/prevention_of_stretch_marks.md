Preventing stretch marks in the long term requires educating oneself about the issue and the science behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Since every human being is prone to getting stretch marks, knowing the detailed [[science_and_structure_of_stretch_marks | science and structure of stretch marks]] is crucial for prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Understanding the Root Cause for Prevention

Stretch marks arise from damage in the dermis, the middle layer of the skin responsible for pliability (ability to stretch) and elasticity (ability to return to original shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The core reason stretch marks appear is due to the body producing fewer fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Fibroblasts are origin cells for connective tissues like collagen and elastin fibers, which provide structure, elasticity, and pliability to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Fewer fibroblasts lead to lesser collagen and elastin fibers, making the skin more prone to damage when stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The two primary reasons for fewer fibroblasts are:
*   **Genetic predisposition** Some individuals are genetically prone to having fewer fibroblasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Stress** Both mental and physical stress (e.g., from over-exercising) cause the body to produce more cortisone, the stress hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Elevated cortisone levels negatively affect fibroblast formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Lifestyle Changes for Prevention

To prevent stretch marks in the long term, especially if your body is prone to them, certain lifestyle changes are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:

### 1. Diet and Hydration
[[impact_of_diet_on_skin_health | Diet]] plays a primary role in prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Hydration** Staying well-hydrated encourages the body to produce more collagen, which helps prevent stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Nutrition** Incorporate foods rich in Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and zinc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Protein-Rich Diet** A diet rich in protein is crucial, as many standard meals, particularly Indian meals, may not provide enough protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### 2. Healthy Weight Management
Maintaining a healthy rate of weight gain and loss is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Weight Gain** A healthy rate of weight gain is approximately 2 to 3 kilograms per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Rapid weight gain can stretch the skin beyond its ability to retain its original shape, damaging the dermis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Weight Loss** If you are obese, you should not lose more than 0.5 kilograms per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Losing weight too rapidly elevates cortisone levels, making the skin more susceptible to stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### 3. Regular Massages
Regular massages of regions prone to stretch marks, especially when they are still "raw" (red or purple), can promote the formation of collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Increased collagen in that area will help prevent future stretch marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Emotional and Psychological Aspect

It's important not to let stretch marks affect one's confidence or [[emotional_impact_and_selfconfidence_related_to_stretch_marks | emotional state of mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. They are a common issue that most human beings deal with and are nothing to be embarrassed about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For those who develop them as a result of a fit lifestyle or weight loss, stretch marks can be seen as "battle scars" and a symbol of achievement, to be held with pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. It's an extremely superficial issue that shouldn't impact one's happiness or self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

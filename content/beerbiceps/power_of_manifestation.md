## Personal Experience with Manifestation

An individual shared a personal anecdote demonstrating the power of [[the_role_of_spirituality_and_manifestation_in_personal_success | manifestation]] during their early days in Bombay:
*   **The Vow** When first arriving in Bombay, the individual decided that they would not see any beach until they successfully "cracked an audition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Even when crossing beaches, they would hide in an auto-rickshaw to avoid seeing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **The Discipline** This self-imposed discipline was so potent that for an entire week, they managed to avoid seeing the beach, even when visiting others' homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **The Achievement** Only after securing their first contract as a radio presenter did they allow themselves to go to the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Upon reaching the beach, they opened their arms, feeling a sense of accomplishment, as if they had "arrived" and "conquered this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

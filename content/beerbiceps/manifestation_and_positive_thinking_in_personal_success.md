Ashna, a fashion blogger and entrepreneur, attributes a significant part of her [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | personal success]] to her belief in [[manifestation_power_and_techniques | manifestation]] and positive thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. She feels that if one desires good outcomes, they will eventually happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## The Power of Manifestation
Ashna's mother also believes her [[manifestation_power_and_techniques | manifestation]] abilities are very strong, noting that when Ashna desires something, it may take time, but it eventually comes to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This perspective is rooted in the idea that the energies one projects into the world are the same energies one receives back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## The Role of Effort
While believing in [[manifestation_power_and_techniques | manifestation]] is key, Ashna emphasizes that it must be coupled with continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It's not enough to simply declare a desire; one must actively work towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Her approach combines [[the_role_of_passion_and_hard_work_in_success | hard work]] with a belief in positive outcomes.

## Positive Thinking
A core component of Ashna's philosophy is "thinking positive and focusing on the good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This [[the_importance_of_mindset_in_achieving_success | mindset]] helps her navigate challenges and maintain focus on her [[the_role_of_personal_ambition_in_achieving_success | goals]], trusting that positive outcomes will follow.

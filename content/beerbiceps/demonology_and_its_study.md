Demonology is defined as the study of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20">[30:20]</a>. Sarbajit Mohanty, a certified demonologist, notes that his certification came from a church, indicating a Christian perspective on this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31">[31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34">[31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36">[31:36]</a>.

## [[differences_between_spirits_and_demons | Distinction Between Spirits and Demons]]

Demons are fundamentally different from spirits. While spirits are the souls of human beings who have passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38">[30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41">[30:41]</a>, demons are considered "inhuman spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43">[30:43]</a>. These entities have never walked the Earth or taken a physical birth from a normal human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45">[30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48">[30:48]</a>.

Demons are perceived as significantly more powerful than regular spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09">[32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11">[32:11]</a>. Research suggests they can inflict greater emotional and physical damage to human beings and cause more widespread havoc in a location compared to normal spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17">[32:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19">[32:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21">[32:21]</a>.

## Origin and Cultural Context

The concept of demons primarily originates from religious books and various religions worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32">[32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34">[32:34]</a>. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism each feature their own unique interpretations of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39">[32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42">[32:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:44">[32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55">[32:55]</a>.

It is believed that these "bad figures" were created by religions to support the concept of "light" or God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01">[33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03">[33:03]</a>. This fosters a strong faith in a deity, as people fear a darker fate if they do not align with their chosen God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06">[33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17">[33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30">[33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32">[33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35">[33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36">[33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39">[33:39]</a>.

In India, indigenous demon figures like Pishach, Asura, and Rakshasa exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58">[30:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01">[31:01]</a>. A Pishach, for example, was once a human who had an inclination to eat raw flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06">[31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10">[31:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12">[31:12]</a>. Asuras, similar to demigods, chose a wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16">[31:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18">[31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20">[31:20]</a>. The Christian understanding of demonology is widely known due to its portrayal in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26">[31:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28">[31:28]</a>.

## [[understanding_demonic_possession | Demonic Possession]]

### Manifestations and Misconceptions
Often, cases reported as demonic possession are later identified as either psychological issues or spirits that are manifesting with such intensity that their activity appears demonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47">[31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51">[31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53">[31:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01">[32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03">[32:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30">[41:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34">[41:34]</a>. True demonic possessions, featuring widely recognized demons like Beelzebub or Asura, have not been directly encountered by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44">[41:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46">[41:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48">[41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51">[41:51]</a>. When assessing phenomena, paranormal investigators refer to them as "intelligent energies" rather than specifically "demons" or "spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56">[41:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58">[41:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01">[42:01]</a>.

### Psychological vs. Demonic
It is crucial to distinguish between genuine demonic possession and mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33">[36:33]</a>. For instance, in cases of suspected possession, the first step for investigators is to request medical reports to rule out psychological conditions like schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:28">[34:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31">[34:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56">[34:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44">[36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46">[36:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48">[36:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50">[36:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51">[36:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54">[36:54]</a>. Many supposed possessions are merely the psychological effects of a human being influenced by external factors or personal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30">[37:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32">[37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34">[37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36">[37:36]</a>. The phenomenon of "excited delirium," where individuals exhibit unusual strength due to heightened adrenaline, can also be mistaken for demonic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53">[39:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54">[39:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57">[39:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31">[40:31]</a>.

## Serial Killers and Demonology

A connection between serial killers and demonology is often discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27">[26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:29">[26:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31">[26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59">[29:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02">[30:02]</a>. For example, the "Son of Sam" case involved David Berkowitz, who claimed his neighbor's dog, believed to be Lucifer, commanded him to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22">[28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24">[28:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41">[28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45">[28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47">[28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49">[28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52">[28:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55">[28:55]</a>. Some serial killers, like Jeffrey Dahmer, are referred to as "it" by the speaker, as individuals who commit such acts are seen as having lost their humanity and soul, becoming "modern-world demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20">[27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22">[27:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25">[27:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31">[27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35">[27:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39">[27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42">[27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43">[27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46">[27:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33">[28:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35">[28:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20">[29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22">[29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25">[29:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27">[29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29">[29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31">[29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33">[29:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34">[29:34]</a>.

Some serial killers have openly discussed their involvement with human sacrifices, occult practices, and Satanic rituals to achieve their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01">[28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04">[28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07">[28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09">[28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12">[28:12]</a>.

## Negative Deity Worship and Satanism
Negative deity worship and Satanic rituals are practiced today, often for material gains or simply for the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:56">[1:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:02">[1:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:05">[1:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:09">[1:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:10">[1:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:12">[1:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:15">[1:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:17">[1:03:17]</a>. There are ongoing cases involving human sacrifice and Satanic rituals that have led to places becoming haunted or infested with demonic entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:21">[1:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:24">[1:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:26">[1:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:28">[1:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:30">[1:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:33">[1:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:35">[1:03:35]</a>. This continues due to a universal human curiosity about the dark side, which can sometimes lead to being controlled by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:43">[1:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:45">[1:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:48">[1:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:50">[1:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:53">[1:03:53]</a>.

## [[role_of_paranormal_investigators_and_varying_beliefs | Role of Paranormal Investigators]]

Paranormal investigators adopt a multifaceted approach to potential demonic cases, always prioritizing scientific and medical explanations first. They often collaborate with medical professionals to understand the human mind better and rule out psychological triggers for reported phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:01">[1:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:03">[1:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:05">[1:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:07">[1:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:10">[1:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:12">[1:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:15">[1:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:18">[1:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:19">[1:05:19]</a>.

Investigators advise filmmakers on depicting horror elements realistically, discouraging the use of real symbols without taking precautions like shielding the set with positive elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:37">[1:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:39">[1:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:42">[1:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:45">[1:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:47">[1:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:50">[1:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:52">[1:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:54">[1:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:56">[1:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:59">[1:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:01">[1:05:01]</a>.

## Challenges to Scientific Acknowledgment
The scientific community largely disregards demonology due to the historical prevalence of fake practitioners who have undermined the field's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:19">[1:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:21">[1:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:25">[1:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:28">[1:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:32">[1:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:34">[1:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:39">[1:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:41">[1:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:43">[1:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:45">[1:04:45]</a>. Mainstream science focuses on research with direct human application and problem-solving, which paranormal phenomena may not be seen as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:30">[1:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:33">[1:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:34">[1:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:37">[1:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:38">[1:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:40">[1:05:40]</a>. Paranormal events also cannot be easily replicated in a laboratory setting, which is a core requirement for scientific validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:50">[1:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:52">[1:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:54">[1:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:56">[1:05:56]</a>. This leads to the belief that "no proof is required for a believer; no proof is enough for a non-believer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:37">[1:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:40">[1:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:42">[1:06:42]</a>.

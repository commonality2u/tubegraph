This article outlines five simple steps to improve spoken English, as shared by Ranveer, addressing common questions about achieving fluency, [[building_confidence_in_english_speaking | confidence]], and better communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ranveer admits that languages are a weakness for him, but English has always been his "thinking language," and he achieves clarity of thought and confidence on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He believes the same tricks he used to improve his spoken Hindi can be applied to English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Approach to Language Learning

Ranveer emphasizes that with any life skill, the process should be made easy and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead of traditional methods like watching news or joining classes, the key is to enjoy the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Practice Habits

To truly improve, it's crucial to make practice a habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Minimum daily practice:** 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Suggested daily practice:** One hour is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Five Simple Steps

### Step 1: Engage with Enjoyable Content

The first step is about making the process enjoyable by choosing content you genuinely like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

*   **Easy Video Content:**
    *   Cartoons are recommended because the language is simple and designed for children to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Sports commentary, especially by Indian commentators like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and Harsh Bhogle, is a great option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
    *   The goal is to choose video content that you really enjoy watching, as this will help improve your English (and Hindi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Audio Content:** If you prefer listening, engage with radio or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Simple Reading:** Reading a bit of simple English can also be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   An ICSE 10th standard textbook with short stories is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Some individuals learn a language better through reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The key is to figure out what works best for you and what you enjoy the most, then do that thing every single day for at least 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Step 2: Observe Sentence Construction

Once you've established the habit of practicing (Step 1), the next step is [[the_role_of_observation_and_practice_in_learning_english | observing]] English from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Focus on Sentence Structure:** The primary focus should be on sentence construction, not just vocabulary or learning big new words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Differences:** While watching or listening to content, pay attention to how sentences are constructed, especially if they differ from your own thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Mental Note and Practice:** Make a mental note of these differences, recognize them as areas for improvement, and then practice saying them 10 times to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Understanding:** Understand how English is spoken first; vocabulary can be focused on later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This ability to understand spoken English comes from consistent [[the_role_of_observation_and_practice_in_learning_english | practice]] and absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Step 3: Put Your Ego Aside

Many Indians associate English with intelligence and tend to judge others' English easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Ignore Criticism:** If someone makes fun of your English, they are often projecting their own insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Embrace Mistakes:** It's perfectly fine to make mistakes while speaking English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In fact, if people point out your mistakes, you'll remember them, and your English will [[overcoming_criticism_and_selfimprovement | improve in the process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Focus on Self-Improvement:** The focus should be on becoming the best version of yourself, not on what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This step is about [[overcoming_the_fear_of_making_mistakes_in_english | overcoming the fear of making mistakes in English]].

### Step 4: Chase Clarity of Thought

Many people struggle with speaking English due to concerns about "what will people think" (`log kahenge`) and the mental translation process from their native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on Clarity:** Prioritize [[improving_focus_for_success | clarity of thought]] to eliminate these hindering factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Meditation:** Meditation is suggested as a powerful tool to clear your mind and ground your thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It helps with [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | maintaining focus]] and is beneficial for various life skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Step 5: Stop Over-Emphasizing English

In Indian society, English is often unduly associated with intelligence, a "flair" stemming from 200 years of British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Challenge the Mentality:** This is a wrong mentality; other countries pride themselves on their native languages (e.g., German in Germany, Japanese in Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Be Proud of Your Culture:** You should be proud of your own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Not speaking English perfectly is not a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Mix Languages if Needed:** If you get stuck while speaking English, it's acceptable to complete your sentences in Hindi or your native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **[[reevaluating_the_importance_of_english_in_indian_society | Reevaluating the Importance of English in Indian Society]]:** This shift in mindset is crucial for true linguistic confidence.

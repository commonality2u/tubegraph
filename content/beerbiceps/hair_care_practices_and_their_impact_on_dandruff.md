Dandruff refers to common scalp conditions that lead to flaking of the skin. While often not harmful, it can be an embarrassing problem to have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article discusses various [[daily_habits_that_harm_hair_quality | hair care practices]] and their impact on dandruff.

## Understanding Different Types of Dandruff
It is important to understand the two main types of dandruff:
*   **Common Dandruff** White flakes fall off your head, but it's generally not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Many anti-dandruff shampoo companies may overstate its severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Soric Dermatitis** This type involves white flakes accompanied by severe itching in the scalp region, around the hairline, and even around the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It can also include boils, rashes, and a lot of irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from soric dermatitis, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Most cases of common dandruff can be managed with specific [[role_of_home_remedies_in_treating_dandruff | home remedies]] and proper hair care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How Dandruff Forms
Dandruff is formed because your scalp is a very active environment, constantly producing and shedding skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If your scalp is also very oily, these dead skin cells collect, mix with the oil, and form the white flakes associated with dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Common Hair Care Mistakes and Dandruff
Dandruff can be caused by imbalances in hair care practices, specifically too little or too much oiling, shampooing, and conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Oiling
*   **Frequency** Oil your hair at least two to three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Benefit** If your scalp gets too dry, it contributes to dead skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Oil acts like a fertilizer for your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Caution** Do not oil your hair more than three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Shampooing
*   **Frequency** If you have dandruff, use a mild shampoo twice or thrice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Use an anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Caution** Do not shampoo too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Daily shampooing can strip your hair of its natural protective layer of oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Conditioning
*   **Composition** Conditioners are oil-based substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Application** Use conditioner every time you use a mild shampoo, but do not overdo or underdo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Using too much can make your scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Hair Product Usage
Excessive hair product usage is a common cause of dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Application** When applying hair products such as waxes, gels, clays, serums, or creams, ensure they do not come into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Products should be applied to the body of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Impact** Applying products to your scalp can increase your dandruff problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Importance of Maintaining a Clean Environment for Dandruff Control
Dandruff is an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and [[importance_of_maintaining_a_clean_environment_for_dandruff_control | caring for your environment]] is crucial for its treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Pillowcases** Clean your pillowcases regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Dip them in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) and leave them for at least 12 hours to get rid of dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes** Do the same cleaning procedure for your combs and brushes that you regularly use on your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear** Clean all types of headgear, including caps, hats, and helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hair Accessories** Any hair bands or hair clips that come into contact with your scalp should also be cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Role of Home Remedies in Treating Dandruff
[[role_of_home_remedies_in_treating_dandruff | Home remedies]] can be effective in treating dandruff by adjusting the scalp's pH level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Skin pH** Your skin's natural pH is 5.5, meaning it is slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This acidity helps kill harmful bacteria and infections, acting as a protective layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Dandruff and pH** For individuals suffering from dandruff, the scalp's pH may be slightly off and not as acidic as it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Acidic Remedies** Many anti-dandruff products and home remedies work by making the scalp slightly more acidic to restore its natural balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Natural products that are slightly acidic can help cure dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Examples**
    *   Curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Apple Cider Vinegar: Use organic apple cider vinegar with "the mother" written on the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Mix it with a little water to make a dilute solution and apply it to your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This cleanses the scalp and works similarly to curd or lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Use of Organic Shampoos for Dandruff Treatment
If you have dandruff, it is necessary to use an anti-dandruff shampoo at least once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Chemicals** Many anti-dandruff shampoos contain harmful chemicals like sulfates and parabens, which can damage the quality of your hair in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Organic Alternatives** Consider [[use_of_organic_shampoos_for_dandruff_treatment | organic anti-dandruff shampoos]] that are sulfate and paraben-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These can help set the scalp's pH right and cure dandruff while maintaining hair quality in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

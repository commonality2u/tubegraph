## Overview of Geopolitical Conflicts
The world is currently experiencing two major wars, along with over 30 other conflicts that receive less global attention, such as the displacement of 8 million people in Sudan, which is not widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Global aid distribution is often political, with billions of dollars allocated to Israel and Ukraine, while other conflicts are overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The current geopolitical phase is characterized by a multi-polar world, where countries are increasingly asserting their independence and are not necessarily adhering to the directives of major powers like the US, Russia, or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### Power Diffusion in the Information Age
In the information age, power has diffused beyond nation-states and rulers to include non-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. This includes terrorist groups, NGOs, civil society movements, and even tech companies, all of whom wield influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. Governments often focus heavily on military expenditure but may neglect these other forces that shape global perception and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

## Israel-Palestine Conflict
The recent conflict in Israel began on a Saturday with initial disbelief at the events unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The speaker, a journalist, traveled to Israel very soon after the attack, noticing that journalists and soldiers are typically the only people entering a country when everyone else is leaving during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. Soldiers are trained and equipped, while journalists are "just chasing stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Upon landing at Ben Gurion Airport, the group immediately experienced a siren and had to run to a shelter, marking a "very hard entry into a war zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

### Human Experience of Conflict
The journalist's son asked if she would "get bombed there" before she left, reflecting the public's concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. In Israel, daily life included hearing "a thud" as something had fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. There was an attempt to meet someone whose sister was taken hostage, but the family was not in a position to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Reporting from an Arab-majority part of Jerusalem, stories were covered about Hamas being declared a terrorist group, which led to their driver becoming "very worked up" and urging them to leave due to the volatile situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. An alarm system notified residents of falling missiles; a false alert caused flights to be canceled and prompted local Israeli friends to advise leaving the country if Hezbollah entered, as it would lead to a "very long-drawn war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

The most poignant moment for the journalist was being invited to a Shabbat dinner by a friend whose husband and son went to fight, and whose elderly mother had to leave her tense home to stay with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. The strength of these people, attending funerals during the day and following customs in the evening while their "whole world seems to have collapsed," was very moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Israelis want Netanyahu to leave and their people to be brought back, as many hostages are still in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Every bomb Israel drops puts the hostages at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. Eradicating a group like Hamas is seen as an unattainable goal, as killing leaders may radicalize more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. It is argued that all people in Palestinian territory should not be punished for Hamas's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

### Double Standards and Perceptions
There are double standards in how protests are perceived: blocking highways in India is seen as a "righteous cause," but blocking highways in Canada leads to police intervention, which is deemed acceptable for affecting law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Similarly, when Russia goes into Ukraine, it's called an "invasion," but when the US goes into Iraq, it's a "global war on terrorism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. This is attributed to the American media's consistent narrative that their actions are for the "global good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

The journalist states that the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a black-and-white equation, making it impossible to declare one side entirely right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. While Israel was initially perceived as the victim of an unprovoked and heinous attack, the conflict should not have escalated to its current extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. The world lacks a strategy, with Americans simultaneously dropping aid packets on Gaza and providing weapons to Israelis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

### Economic Aspects of War
Wars create their own economies beyond just weapons manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. For example, during the Gaza conflict, people were facilitating the exit of Gazans into Egypt for a fee, reportedly streamlined by an Egyptian company close to the president, making millions of dollars daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Additionally, Palestinian groups reportedly demand a share of humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which is then sold on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>.

### Iran's Regional Influence
Iran, an oil-rich nation, has historically been a significant geopolitical player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. After the 1979 Revolution, the clergy came to power, dismantling the previous liberal society and implementing Islamic law, which restricted women's freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. Iran's engagement with the West included the JCPOA (nuclear deal), which aimed to prevent Iran from enriching uranium for a bomb in exchange for lifting sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. However, the US unilaterally exited this deal under Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.

Iran has spread its influence thinly across the region through proxies such as Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen, and maintains a force in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. This has led to widespread issues with other regional actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>. The recent missile strike between Israel and Iran was described as a "performative strike," intended to show strength to its own people without causing actual damage to avoid reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.

## [[International journalism challenges | Journalism in Conflict Zones]]
Journalists covering conflicts often face significant challenges, including a lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. Some Indian reporters covering the war in Israel reportedly lacked funds for transportation, resorting to hitchhiking, driven by passion for the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. They often lack combat training or appropriate gear for reporting in conflict zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. The physical and psychological impact is also significant, with memories of war zones unsettling one even when back home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

Ashish Chanchlani's upbringing by his parents, Anil and Deepa Chanchlani, played a significant role in shaping his character and career, instilling strong values of humility, hard work, and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His family's approach emphasizes discipline, respect, and a grounded perspective on success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Emphasis on Humility and Hard Work

Ashish's parents highlighted the importance of humility from a young age. His mother noted that both Ashish and Muskan are "very humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and treat everyone, including their cook or watchman, with respect and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They never displayed jealousy towards others' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, finding positive feelings in seeing others work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This perspective aligns with the belief that true success lies in maintaining humility, regardless of fame or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

His father, Anil Chanchlani, instilled the value that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He observed that while many [[challenges_of_growing_up_in_a_wealthy_family | rich kids are sheltered]], Ashish started working with him from the age of 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, taking on responsibilities like tracing, and daily banking duties, including depositing cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This early exposure to hard work and business shaped a significant part of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Parental Influence on Career Path

### Supporting Unconventional Ambitions
When Ashish decided he no longer wanted to pursue engineering, his father supported his desire to become an actor, advising him to finish his studies alongside pursuing his passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This demonstrated a flexible and supportive approach to [[family_life_and_parenting_challenges | parenting challenges]], trusting their children to pursue their chosen paths.

### Encouraging Discipline and Education
Despite supporting his passion, his father emphasized the importance of completing education, stating, "you just have to finish your studies, don't leave in a midway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He believes that while passion is good, education remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. His parents advised both Ashish and Muskan to "be a disciplined life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, stressing its overall benefits.

### Guiding Through Fame
As Ashish and Muskan gained fame, their parents ensured they remained grounded. Anil Chanchlani taught Ashish from a young age that the hunger for success leads to humility, citing examples of film stars whose relevance depended on a film's success, reinforcing that fame is transient if not backed by continuous hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Learning from Father's Business Acumen and Independence

Ashish's father, despite being the son of a wealthy man, felt the pressure to "become a legend in his own way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> and came out of his comfort zone to establish himself independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This taught Ashish the importance of creating his own identity rather than relying on inherited wealth or status, stating, "I wanted to be on my own feet, independent, earn on my own self and have my own identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. His father also involved him in the multiplex business, where Ashish contributed significantly by suggesting advanced technologies like 3D and 7.1 Dolby sound, influencing the state-of-the-art facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Mother's Support and Guidance

Initially, Ashish's mother was unsure about his vine channel, wondering "what he is doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, after watching his videos and seeing others' positive reactions, she became very supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. She provided all necessary support at home and encouraged him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Muskan noted that she learned "humidity and bonding" from her mother, especially the ability to bond with anyone and everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Ashish also learned from his mother to be consistently positive and optimistic, believing "something good comes out of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

His mother advises other parents to let their children pursue their passions, giving them at least a year to see if they can succeed, without restricting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. She believes children should be allowed to "fly" like a bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, preventing confusion about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Family Dynamics and Core Values

The Chanchlani family values revolve around humility, treating everyone equally, and persistent hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | role of family and upbringing in shaping character]] is evident in Ashish and Muskan's consistent down-to-earth nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The collective [[the_influence_of_family_dynamics_on_success | influence of family dynamics on success]] is clear, with both parents contributing distinct lessons: the father emphasized striving for success and independence, while the mother fostered positivity and respect for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This foundation has enabled Ashish to build his own identity and thrive in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

[[Military experiences and storytelling | Military experiences and storytelling]] from veterans of the [[Experiences of Indian Special Forces | Indian Special Forces]] (SF) offer profound insights into handling extreme pressure and the nature of combat. Major Viv Jacob, a highly respected and battle-hardened Special Forces veteran, shares his unique perspectives on the physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of military life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>.

## The Nature of Special Forces
The Armed Forces niche, particularly regarding [[Experiences of Indian Special Forces | Indian Special Forces]], began with Major Viv Jacob's intense conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Major Jacob is considered one of India's most fierce and battle-hardened soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

The Special Forces are described as the highest efficiency troop within the Indian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, psychologically and physically a cut above the rest due to their supplemental [[Military training and preparation | training]] and mission types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Major Jacob emphasizes that Special Forces is primarily a mindset that develops over time through various emotional, psychological, and physical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

The core idea of Special Forces is "creative destruction" with an open-ended mandate to do anything, anywhere, anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This force is a directed energy applied by the government for national security, ensuring a safe environment for citizens to live freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Extreme Combat Scenarios

### A Soldier's Impossible Survival
One young soldier, described as a fantastic and pure soul, encountered a head-on contact where the enemy fired first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The bullet hit his bulletproof vest, which then collapsed and cracked his skull with such impact that his eye popped out and was hanging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite this horrific injury, the soldier immediately killed the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. After months of hospital treatment, he had no memory of his family or who he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. He would look at old photographs to remember his past appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. His face was disfigured, he lost an eye, and his engagement broke off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>. This individual, once a "super soldier," was later given a cushy canteen position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>. His heart grew heavy, and his perception of life shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. However, years later, he had recovered much of his former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.

### The Most Challenging Experience: A Teammate's Injury
Major Jacob recounts his most challenging battlefield experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Over a decade into his career, he felt an unprecedented, overwhelming discomfort and anxiety during an operation, instinctively wanting to extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He couldn't find a logical reason to leave, assuming it was laziness for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He decided to stick on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Shortly after, an explosion occurred, and his teammate stepped on a mine, losing his leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This event plunged them into "ultimate chaos" far from base, with blood spurting and the need to remain undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. In the SF, a "f\*\*\* up" primarily means a teammate getting shot, maimed, or dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

In such a chaotic environment, where everything is out of control and death is in the air, the difference between life and death depends on immediate actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Major Jacob's decision was to immediately go into repair mode: administering morphine, setting IVs, stemming blood flow, bandaging, and assessing the wound to extend the teammate's life until extraction and proper surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. His teammate remained quiet throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] The True Nature of Battle
> "Nobody's going to come and kill you or none of your friends are going to die, your team is not nobody's going to die if you make a mistake out there that's how it is the SF is you make a mistake somebody's going to die and like worse somebody might might get maed for Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:57">[02:06:57]</a>

## Psychological and Spiritual Aspects in Combat
### The Flow State
In high-pressure situations, especially when a teammate's life hangs in the balance, entering a [[Survival instincts and training in extreme circumstances | flow state]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This involves surrendering to the situation, which leads to acceptance, then awareness, and finally the ability to make the crucial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Major Jacob was "always in a flow state, no past, no future, always in the now" during his service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Intuition and the Sixth Sense
Over time, in combat, soldiers can develop a "sixth sense" or intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Major Jacob had no idea such a thing existed but came to feel when something was going to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This [[Survival instincts and training in extreme circumstances | intuition]] deepened, eventually allowing him to know five or six hours before an event that something would occur, even if not in the enemy's vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This happens when one lets go of duality (life/death, past/future) and fully focuses on the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### Spirit and Matter
Major Jacob believes everything is spiritual, as everything originates from a source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. In life-and-death scenarios, soldiers must cross a barrier where the chances of losing life or limb are always present, a "50/50" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. When leaving base for an operation, one must forget about probabilities and exist solely in the "now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This [[Survival skills and training in the army | surrender]] allows the spiritual aspect of existence to open up, enabling entry into the dimension of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Surrendering to Conquer
> To conquer chaos, one must first surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This means accepting the situation, becoming aware, focusing, and entering a flow state to either create or destroy chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### The Illusion of Self and Karma
Major Jacob believes that "karma exists for those whose neural network is formed like that" and for whom "cause and effect is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. However, for "consciousnesses which have zoomed out," karma is an illusion, like everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. What one perceives as reality is individual, similar to how different artists paint different pictures with the same colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

The "I" or ego is a limitation created by the mind's neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. When this "I" dissolves, the "real you" or "source" (Spirit, God, Supreme Consciousness) opens up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. In this state, time, space, and energy operate simultaneously, allowing access to higher information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Interaction with Nature in Combat Zones
Unlike civilian life, Special Forces personnel operate in raw nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Their work often takes them to high-altitude mountains and deep forests, where they are constantly exposed to wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### The Leopard Encounter
During a sentry duty in pitch darkness, Major Jacob was staring into the darkness, waiting for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. He heard a noise right next to him, turned on his night vision goggles, and saw a leopard sitting less than a meter away, staring at the same spot he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. He pointed his weapon at the leopard, ready to fire if attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. After about four to five minutes, the leopard quietly got up and walked off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Major Jacob reflects that, like humans finding common ground, he and the leopard were both peaceful and aligned in that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Animals, operating on instinct rather than thoughts or judgment, are in a higher state of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Soldiers in combat, by shedding their minds and fears, align with nature, even beginning to smell like the forest, making them less of a threat to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### The Bear Charge
Major Jacob recalls an encounter with two bears after infiltrating their cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Bears, though seemingly cute, are extremely dangerous with immense strength and sharp claws capable of tearing a person apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. A mother bear with cubs is the most dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. One bear charged directly at them, stopping just two meters away, roaring into Major Jacob's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He held his weapon at its head, not wanting to shoot and compromise the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. His local SF teammate used a laser light to flash in the bear's eyes, startling it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. In this five-second intense moment, Major Jacob was in a flow state, without fear or emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Surviving the Impossible
Major Jacob recounts a near-death experience where he was stuck on a cliff, holding onto grass, with a deep drop below, new slippery shoes, and a heavy rucksack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. He was spotted by an enemy, and there was "nowhere I could go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. He described it as an "impossible situation," a "0% chance" of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. In that moment, he experienced a "life flash," a detached, emotionless observation of his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Time dilation occurred, where 20-25 years of life were seen in "no time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Despite the enemy having a gun pointed at him, they chose not to shoot, a complete reversal of what should have happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This experience taught him about "an alternative form of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Lessons for Civilian Life
Major Jacob believes that [[Military experiences and storytelling | military experiences]] can help civilians navigate life's ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. While civilian problems don't typically involve death, they can still be intensely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. In chaotic situations, whether in combat or civilian life, the key to [[Survival instincts and training in extreme circumstances | survival]] is awareness of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. By surrendering to the truth of the situation (e.g., that it's "anybody's game"), accepting that one can die, and remaining aware, one can identify opportunities to change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Soul of Steel
Major Jacob and his team are developing "Soul of Steel," a program that combines [[Military training and preparation | military mountaineering]] and combat experiences with adventure and mountaineering skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This initiative teaches unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, [[Survival skills and training in the army | survival skills]], and navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Participants will face real-world situations in high-altitude mountains, crossing crevasses and developing skills that unleash their self-realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The goal is to create "human ability biomes" where individuals, including those with disabilities and Olympic athletes, can interact with the outside world to realize their inherent "godliness"—supreme ability and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This program aims to help people become more open, spread love, joy, peace, and capability in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

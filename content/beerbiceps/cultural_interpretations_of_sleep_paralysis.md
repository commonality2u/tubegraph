[[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | Sleep paralysis]] is a scientific phenomenon where an individual half-wakes up while sleeping, experiencing an inability to move or scream, with only vision remaining conscious [00:01:53]. In severe cases, nightmares can merge with the experience, causing confusion between dreams and reality [00:02:44]. The body's natural protection mechanism paralyzes muscles during sleep to prevent physical reactions to dreams; however, in sleep paralysis, this mechanism persists even when a person is partly awake [00:02:02].

## Manifestations of Sleep Paralysis

Common manifestations of [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] often involve opening one's eyes in their own room and seeing a shadowy figure, with the inability to react or scream, leading the individual to close their eyes and hope to fall back asleep [00:03:08]. The speaker recounts a personal experience at age 11, where he felt shadowy creatures chaining him down to the bed, welcoming a "lady" or "queen" [00:03:45]. This figure was described as having pale, achy, torn skin, blisters, untidy hair, and a single pale red eye staring down while sitting on his chest [00:04:16]. The speaker felt the figure's weight and fingers, unable to move or scream despite trying to call for his mother [00:05:01].

## Cultural Interpretations and Beliefs

While [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] can be attributed to hallucination or the phenomenon itself [00:06:05], various cultures have specific interpretations.

### Japanese Phenomenon
A National Geographic show explored a Japanese phenomenon where [[sleep_paralysis_and_personal_experiences | sleep paralysis]] is accompanied by a "witch sitting on top of you" [00:06:33]. The show suggested a theory that aliens might simulate this experience to conduct experiments on humans, creating the imagery of a woman sitting on the person to manipulate perception [00:06:50]. The visual representation of this witch in the show, including details like a single eye, hair on one side, burnt-up skin, untidy clothes, and pale, dead eyes, exactly mirrored the speaker's personal experience [00:07:17].

### Local Accounts
Years after his personal experience, the speaker's [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychic]] friend visited his childhood home and identified a room directly below where the speaker's incident occurred as having "dark energy" or a "demon or a ghost" [00:11:11]. The speaker's grandfather, who had run a hospital in the building since the 1960s, corroborated these concerns, stating that patients over 50 years had reported feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night [00:12:09]. Some patients even claimed a woman pushed them off their hospital beds, seeing a flash of a "really scary looking woman" [00:12:40].

## Spiritual Approaches to Overcome Fear
Growing up in a spiritual family, the speaker's mother taught him a mantra, "Om Nam," specifically intended to ward off bad spirits [00:05:22]. During his experience, saying this mantra was his only recourse, and he subsequently fell asleep and the figure was gone when he awoke [00:05:36].

The speaker later overcame his deep-seated fear of the dark and the entity that seemed to stare at him by embracing spirituality and [[meditation_and_its_effects_on_sleep_and_consciousness | meditation]] [00:08:22]. He notes that spirituality, beyond [[meditation_and_its_effects_on_sleep_and_consciousness | meditation]] and karma, addresses the spirit world, astral world, dark energies, and demons, and provides ways to tackle these energies [00:08:37]. Applying the principle of "when you stare fear in the eye, it ceases to exist," he strengthened his "spiritual muscle" through [[meditation_and_its_effects_on_sleep_and_consciousness | meditation]] [00:08:48]. In a shared meditation session, he and his co-founder felt a dark energy, which they believed they pushed out of the room by continuing to meditate and chanting the "Om Nam" mantra [00:10:08]. The subsequent confirmation from his [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychic]] friend reinforced the belief that their [[meditation_and_its_effects_on_sleep_and_consciousness | meditation]] practices had helped clear the negative presence [00:11:42]. To further positively influence the environment, pujas, havans, and candles were used in the building [00:13:14].

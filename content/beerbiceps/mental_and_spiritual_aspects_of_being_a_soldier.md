Major Viv Jacob, a highly respected Special Forces veteran, discusses the profound [[mental_health_and_spirituality | mental health and spirituality]] that can develop from a career in the [[life_in_the_indian_army | Indian Army]], particularly within the Special Forces. His insights delve into the nature of reality, human consciousness, and the unique psychological and spiritual transformations that occur when facing extreme life-or-death situations.

## The Special Forces Mindset
Major Jacob emphasizes that Special Forces is not merely a job but a "mindset" that evolves over time through various physical, emotional, and psychological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. He believes that everyone is "uniquely special," and the realization of this inherent uniqueness forms the core of this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This perspective allows for focused energy, directed towards national security to ensure a safe environment for citizens to live their lives without worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Special Forces operations involve "creative destruction," with open-ended mandates to execute tasks anywhere, anytime, under various parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

Each operation is seen as a "masterpiece," requiring soldiers to be fully present in the "now" because every goal and circumstance is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. Soldiers rely on their [[military_training_and_preparation | previous training]], equipment, and experiences to accomplish their missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

## Coping with Chaos and Extreme Challenges
Major Jacob recounted his most challenging battlefield experience, where he felt an overwhelming instinct to "extract" from a situation, even though nothing had explicitly gone wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. This discomfort escalated into extreme anxiety, a feeling he had never experienced before in his decade-long career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. He attributed this internal struggle to a desire for comfort, but chose to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. Shortly after, an explosion occurred, and his teammate lost a leg, plunging them into ultimate chaos far from base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

### Brotherhood and Responsibility
In such high-stress situations, the life and death of a teammate, or "brother," can depend on one's immediate actions and mental clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. The Special Forces prepare for such "f***-ups," which primarily involve teammates getting shot, maimed, or dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. During this incident, Major Jacob immediately entered "repair mode," administering morphine, managing blood loss, bandaging the wound, and assessing damage to extend his teammate's survival time until extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

> "The true nature of battle... you might end up losing a teammate... where something goes wrong and you face some sort of a challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.
>
> "If you make a mistake somebody's going to die and like worse somebody might might get maed for Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>.

He highlights the profound impact of battle, where individuals can lose memories or suffer severe disfigurement, affecting their perception of themselves and their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. Despite these hardships, soldiers often recover their previous sense of self over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>.

## Spiritual Dimensions in Combat
For soldiers constantly facing life-and-death scenarios, a barrier is crossed where the chances of losing life or limb are always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. To operate effectively, one must "let go of duality"—the concepts of black and white, life and death—and focus entirely on the "now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>. This surrender to the situation leads to acceptance, then awareness, and finally the ability to make critical choices that can determine survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

### Flow State and Intuition
Major Jacob describes entering a "Flow State" in combat, where there is "no past no future, always in the now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. In this state, "spirit and matter... become singular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. Over time, soldiers can develop a "sixth sense" or intuition, enabling them to know that something is going to happen even hours before it does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>. This is explained as a new neural network forming, allowing the material form to experience something that hasn't yet occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>. By surrendering the idea of past, future, life, and death, one opens up to a spiritual dimension where awareness allows information to "pour into your consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>.

### Karma and Perception
Regarding the law of karma, Major Jacob believes it exists for those whose neural networks are formed to perceive cause and effect as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:25:00">[49:25:00]</a>. However, for "consciousness which has zoomed out," karma is seen as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a>. He emphasizes that reality is subjective, shaped by individual perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:11:00">[51:11:00]</a>. Soldiers, driven by duty, may not initially consider karma, but reflection later in life can bring new perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>.

## Connection with Nature and Animals
[[Interaction with nature in military settings | Military personnel, especially in Special Forces]], are constantly immersed in raw nature, operating in high-altitude mountains and deep forests away from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>. Major Jacob notes that soldiers merge with nature not just physically but also at a deeper consciousness level, as "all life has awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.

### Leopard Encounter
He recounts an instance where he was on sentry duty at night in a dangerous location. After an hour and a half, he heard a noise nearby. Using night vision goggles, he discovered a leopard sitting quietly beside him, staring in the same direction he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:07:00">[59:07:00]</a>. The leopard was less than a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Major Jacob readied his weapon, prepared to defend himself, but the leopard simply sat for a few minutes before quietly walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. He attributes this peaceful co-existence to both being "in alignment" and "in peace," as animals operate on instinct, beyond human judgment, embodying a "higher consciousness" by not dwelling on past or future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### Bear Encounter
He also shared a terrifying encounter with two bears. While on an observation mission, he found a cave that turned out to be the bears' home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Later that night, two large bears, one charging directly at him, cornered him and his team on a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. A bear stood and roared mere feet from his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. In a moment of extreme tension, his teammate used a laser light to startle the bear, causing it to stumble back and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Major Jacob recounts this experience as being in a "Flow State," where all fear vanishes, and the focus is entirely on the immediate action required for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.

## The Nature of Reality and Self
Major Jacob shares a profound near-death experience during which he saw his "entire life flash" before his eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This "time dilation" allowed him to observe all his life's events in "no time," without any emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt – just "detached observation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. He describes this as a "micro ayahuasca experience" or a "burst" within the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>.

His understanding of reality is that "all of reality is an illusion, it's a dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>, akin to a cosmic mind dreaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:16">[01:44:16]</a>. In this dream, all characters and circumstances, including joy and fear, feel real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>. However, upon "waking up" (realizing it's a dream), one understands its moldable nature, allowing them to "dream the dream you wish to dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>.

The "ego" is seen as the mind's tendency, limiting one's experience through judgment and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. Stepping back and observing without judgment allows for a clearer picture of reality and facilitates instinctive, non-thought-based choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>.

## Soul of Steel and Human Ability Biomes
Post-military, Major Jacob is involved with "Soul of Steel," an initiative that combines military and mountaineering experiences and skill sets to create a hybrid program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. This program teaches unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, [[survival_skills_and_training_in_the_army | survival skills and training in the army]], navigation, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32">[01:57:32]</a>. The goal is to face real situations in the wild, which "Unleash Your realization of your own self" and help individuals become more secure and positive human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.

This initiative aims to create "human ability biomes," fostering environments where individuals from diverse backgrounds—from people with disabilities to Olympic athletes—can realize their inherent "godliness" or "supreme ability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. By transcending the limitations of the mind and ego, this potential can be realized through interaction with the outside world, leading to more open human beings who "spread love, joy and peace and capability in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>. This work, alongside [[military_experiences_and_storytelling | military experiences and storytelling]], helps others navigate complex life situations and "snap out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>.

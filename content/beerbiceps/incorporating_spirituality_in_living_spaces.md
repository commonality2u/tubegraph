The speaker's dream house, a culmination of six years of work, four businesses, and a supportive community, is intentionally designed to serve as a "Dream space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Built to align with the speaker's desires as a 28-year-old, the house emphasizes personal peace, creativity, and collective growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Many design choices within the home reflect a deliberate [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual]] approach to living and working.

## Design for Inner Calm and Creativity

A central theme throughout the house is fostering a sense of calm and promoting creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Macrame Decor** The entire house is decorated with macrame home decor, made by Mumbai artists. This choice was made because the threads and jute-based decor heavily calm the speaker, counteracting the speedy and erratic nature of entrepreneurship and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Ocean Blue Palette** The living room's central feature is a large artwork representing the ocean blue, chosen for its spiritual and calming effect, despite blue not being the speaker's favorite color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Ocean View** The house's location was chosen for its view of the ocean, which inspires the speaker to "keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This view helps to reduce self-doubt and provides a constant reminder of the hard work that led to this life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The ocean theme is prevalent throughout the house, reminding the team of its greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Spiritual Reminders and Practices

The house incorporates several elements to serve as constant reminders for [[spiritual_practices_and_transformation | spiritual practices and transformation]]:
*   **Buddha Idols** Numerous Buddha idols are placed around the house to "take [the speaker] back to the core of it all," which is "spiritual progress" and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They serve as a prompt to meditate daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Greenery and Plants** Recommended by the architect, plants are now an important part of the speaker's life and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The speaker meditates and practices pranayama (breathing exercises) among the plants on the balcony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Podcast Studio as a Temple** The podcasting studio, where the main work happens, is deliberately designed to also serve as a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The speaker believes that work creating societal impact is a highly spiritual act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This space includes a YSS altar, a Buddha statue, and a photo of the speaker's childhood guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Personal Space for Reflection** The speaker's private section of the house—bedroom and office—is also considered a "temple" where they sleep, write, and meditate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. It contains Buddha statues and a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, whose life as a strategist, leader, and [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual]] person is studied for personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Crystals** The speaker has begun keeping crystals in both the podcasting studio and their own room, believing they emit positive energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Seclusion Point** A dedicated space for seclusion allows the speaker to retreat and think, especially when feeling low, aiding in the continuous process of overcoming self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. A painting in this area symbolizes leadership, creativity, rest, and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Themes and Purpose

The entire house is designed not just as a living space but as a tool for personal and collective development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. It aims to keep [[spirituality_meditation_and_mental_health_in_modern_life | mental health in check]], amp up creativity, and help the team grow collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The house is a stepping stone for continuous exploration of the speaker's mind and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

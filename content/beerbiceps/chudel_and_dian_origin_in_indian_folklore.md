Chudel (also spelled Chudail) and Dian are supernatural entities in [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | Indian spiritual beliefs]] with a similar, overlapping origin theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Origin Theory
It is believed that a woman turns into a Chudel or Dian under specific circumstances related to her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>:
*   When she dies during childbirth or while pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   If her body is not cremated properly with all the required rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The transformation is attributed to a "latent desire" remaining in her mind at the time of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Characteristics
*   **Unsatisfied and Vengeful:** Once transformed, the Chudel is believed to remain on Earth unsatisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. She is unable to witness the happiness of other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, suggesting a vengeful nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Type of Witch:** A Chudel is described as a type of witch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Regional Variations:** The distinction between Chudel and Dian is largely based on the region in which the folklore is prevalent, though their core characteristics and origins are very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, sharing "lots of parallels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Comparison to Yakshin
Chudel and Dian are often discussed alongside other supernatural entities in Indian folklore, such as Yakshin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Yakshin** are considered demigoddesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   They are believed to reside in a realm between Earth and Heaven, known as Alkapuri, which is governed by Kubera (Ravana's brother and protector of wealth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   When Yakshin descend to Earth, they are usually in their evil forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   They are described as very voluptuous and beautiful initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. However, once their seduction wears off, they reveal their evil form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   Their victims are typically men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Yakshin are particularly prevalent in the folklore of South India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

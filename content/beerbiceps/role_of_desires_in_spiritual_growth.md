The concept of desire plays a fundamental and complex role in [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | spiritual progress and transformation]], particularly within the framework of Tantra.

## Desires as a Governing Force

According to spiritual teachings, the most powerful *shaktis* (forces) created are sex, money, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>. Everything is governed by these three, and human life fundamentally revolves around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>. A person who transcends these three is considered a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:46">[02:18:46]</a>.

These three forces are linked by an element of greed. The enjoyment of sex, money, or power often leads to a desire for "more," which can corrupt one's discrimination and lead to mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. Unrestricted pursuit of these desires, as observed across millennia and various philosophies, ultimately leads to suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

Desire is deeply ingrained in life; "the whole world runs on desire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. The "mother of all desires" is identified as Keshwari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. Even the cells of the body inherently express desire, such as avoiding pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:37">[01:55:37]</a>.

## Tantric Perspective on Desires

Unlike some philosophies that advocate for rejecting Maya (material illusion) as a falsehood, [[concept_of_black_magic_and_desires_in_Tantra | Tantra]] views Maya as the body and manifestation of the Divine Mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Therefore, [[concept_of_black_magic_and_desires_in_Tantra | Tantra]] does not reject what nature has given, but rather seeks to appreciate and work through the material realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.

Natural human tendencies, such as eating meat or engaging in sex (in a normal, healthy context), are acknowledged as part of the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Desire itself, within limits, is considered a positive aspect that can contribute to a happy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

The core principle in [[concept_of_black_magic_and_desires_in_Tantra | Tantra]] is to find the "germ of happiness" and "germ of spirituality" within these very things that might otherwise lead to a person's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Instead of rejection, the aim is to use these elements to ascend spiritually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. This requires discipline; for instance, sex within [[concept_of_black_magic_and_desires_in_Tantra | Tantra]] is to be used in a very disciplined and specific manner, not indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

The ability to switch from attachment to detachment is a hallmark of a great human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. One of [[Karmic lessons and spiritual growth | Bhairava's]] blessings is to cultivate a degree of detachment from lower desires, thus creating the "bandwidth" to contemplate and pursue higher, spiritual desires, such as experiencing higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:28">[01:56:28]</a>. If the mind remains fixated on the lower three "chakras" (sex, money, power), spiritual ascent will not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>.

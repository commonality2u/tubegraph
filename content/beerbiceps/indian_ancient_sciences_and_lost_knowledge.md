The term "mythology" is often seen as offensive when applied to [[Indian culture | Indian culture]] and history, as it implies these narratives are untrue, a perception that arose from imperialist Europeans [00:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Many Indians prefer to refer to works like the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayan]] and the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharat]], as well as the Vishnu Puran and Shiv Puran, as [[Indian culture | Indian history]] and culture [00:00:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. There is a recognized lack of awareness about this subject among both younger and older generations [00:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Reclaiming Ancient Knowledge and Scientific Outlook

A significant amount of India's historical records were lost or destroyed due to invasions over the last 1,000 years [00:02:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It is believed that India was potentially more knowledgeable 1,000 to 2,000 years ago than it is today [00:03:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. There is a growing interest in exploring [[Indian culture | ancient Indian culture]] and [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | history]] [00:04:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Understanding these ancient narratives requires an open mind, as they contain significant scientific knowledge and lessons, rather than just being historical accounts or legends [00:05:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> "I would say [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Indian religion]] has always been about curiosity. It is about knowing more, trying to find out more about the world, about yourself, about God the creator of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The earliest [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Indian scriptures]], such as the Rig Veda and Upanishads, emphasize curiosity and continuous inquiry [00:05:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Advanced astrophysicists often find parallels between their mathematical studies and the concepts described in Vedanta and the Vedas [00:07:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Concepts of the Universe and Life Beyond Earth

### Multiverse and Locas
According to [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Indian scriptures]], the universe is not singular, but rather part of a "Multiverse" [00:19:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. The Srimad Bhagavatam Puran describes a spiritual universe (three-quarters of existence) and a material universe (one-quarter) [00:19:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Within the material realm, millions of universes are said to emanate from the pores of the Karodakshayi Vishnu with each exhalation [00:20:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Each of these universes has its own Brahma, who creates "Locas" or planes of existence [00:20:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

There are 14 described Locas in the universe: Earth (Madya Loka) is in the middle, with seven lower Locas and six higher Locas [00:11:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Aliens and Advanced Civilizations
The inhabitants of these different Locas are, by definition, "aliens" as they do not originate from Earth [00:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The Devas (divine beings) possess advanced technology, including divine weapons and spaceships (Vimanas), allowing them to travel between Locas [00:12:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The Asuras (often depicted as demons) also have advanced sciences and can travel across these planes [00:13:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

*   **Tripurasura Story**: Describes three floating cities of Asuras that could only be destroyed when aligned in a single line, suggesting advanced scientific principles or orbital mechanics [00:13:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This event, known as "Dev Deepavali," is still celebrated in some Shiva temples [00:14:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Devas and Asuras**: May represent two warring, technologically advanced alien tribes, with those friendly to humans becoming "Gods" and those inimical becoming "villains" [00:15:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Vimanas
[[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Indian texts]] mention flying machines called Vimanas [01:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. The Pushpak Vimana, though widely known as Ravana's, originally belonged to his stepbrother Kubera, from whom Ravana usurped it [00:57:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. Other flying machines are mentioned, like those used by Shalva in the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharat]] [00:58:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

These machines were not created by humans but by advanced civilizations:
*   Vishwakarma, the architect of the Gods, created the Pushpak Vimana [00:59:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   Mayadanav, the architect of the Asuras, created Shalva's plane [00:59:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   Some Vimanas are described as running on a "Mercury Vortex" [01:00:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>). The "Vaimanika Shastra" provides details on different types and shapes of planes, with some Western researchers successfully testing the aerodynamic stability of these designs [01:01:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

## Cycles of Time and Geological Events

### Kalpas and Brahma's Lifespan
The universe operates on vast timescales called "Kalpas" [00:22:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Brahma, the creator, has a lifespan of approximately 311 trillion human years [00:21:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. We are currently in the 51st year of Brahma's life [00:21:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> and in the seventh Manvantara (a subdivision of a day) [00:22:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Each day of Brahma is a Kalpa, during which creation and dissolution occur repeatedly [00:22:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Different Puranas often refer to different Kalpas, explaining why creation stories or the supremacy of certain gods (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) can differ across texts [00:23:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Ice Ages and Global Deluge
[[Astronomical Evidence and Indian Texts | Scientific evidence]] and [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | ancient texts]] suggest that Earth has experienced warming and cooling periods, including Ice Ages [00:39:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Some interpretations of Vedic verses suggest that [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Vedic people]] may have lived in the Arctic Zone when it had a more temperate climate, before migrating south due to the Ice Age [00:40:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Descriptions of six-month days and nights in the Rig Veda support this theory [00:40:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

During Ice Ages, sea levels drop as water freezes [00:45:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. When ice melts, sea levels rise, inundating coastal civilizations [00:46:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. This phenomenon is believed to be the basis for global deluge stories found in nearly all world mythologies, including those of Mesopotamia, Sumeria, Africa, and Native American cultures, as well as the story of Dwarka [00:46:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

The Matsya Avatar story, where Lord Vishnu appears as a fish to Manu, the leader of mankind, warns of a global flood [00:47:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. Manu is instructed to gather relevant plant and animal species and the Saptarishis (sages) to preserve knowledge before the flood [00:48:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of preserving knowledge to rebuild civilization after catastrophic events [00:49:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

### Submarine Volcanoes
[[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Indian scriptures]] describe a "mare-shaped fire" (Bāḍavānala) stored under the water to prevent destruction [00:53:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This concept aligns with the scientific understanding of submarine volcanoes [00:54:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>). It is said that this underwater fire will eventually engulf the planet, possibly predicting catastrophic volcanic events, tsunamis, and atmospheric emissions [00:54:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

## Lost Cultures and Sciences

### Ancient Indian Cities
[[Ancient Indian Temples and Architecture | Ancient Indian cities]], particularly those of the Indus-Saraswati civilization, were among the most well-planned in the world [00:03:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The loss of awareness about this advanced urban planning highlights a disconnect from [[Indian culture | India's civilizational knowledge]] [00:03:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Soma
Soma, a substance detailed in the ninth Mandala of the Rig Veda, was a crucial part of [[Indian culture | ancient culture]] [00:31:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. While some researchers believed it to be a psychedelic mushroom, descriptions in the Rig Veda suggest it was an "invigorating substance" extracted from the stalks of a shrub or creeper, yielding a bitter juice mixed with milk or curd [00:30:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Soma was consumed by gods like Indra before war to provide an "adrenaline rush," rather than as an intoxicant [00:32:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

*   The plant is described as growing in mountain regions, specifically the Himalayas, extending from Tibet to Afghanistan [00:35:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.
*   The Parsi community in Mumbai still practices a "Haoma ceremony," similar to the Vedic Soma ceremony, involving extracting juice from a stock imported from Afghanistan until recent times [00:36:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   The ritualistic filter used in the Soma ceremony is described poetically in the Rig Veda as having 10 holes, akin to "10 maidens," a practice also seen in the Parsi ceremony [00:38:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

### Connections to Other Civilizations
The [[ancient_vedic_scriptures_and_their_scientific_interpretations | Vedic]] and Iranian civilizations developed almost concurrently, sharing similar languages (Indo-European) and cultural elements, but were often antagonists [00:36:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. For example, Devas were gods for Vedics but demons for Zoroastrians (asuras) [00:36:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

The "Out of Africa" theory, which posits that Homo sapiens emerged in East Africa and migrated globally, suggests that populations from Africa came to India around 60,000 BCE [00:43:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. These populations in the tropical zone of India then further migrated to other parts of the world, including Europe, Siberia, and the Americas via the Bering Bridge (now Bering Strait) [00:44:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. This explains the physical similarities between Native Americans, Japanese, and Chinese peoples [00:44:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This migration to the Americas happened around 14,000 years ago [00:45:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

### Dinosaur Mentions in Texts and Art
The Sharabha, a mythical creature described as a chimeric being with limbs from multiple animals, is said to be the "king of all animals" and the "ultimate predator in the food chain," leading to the scientific interpretation that it could represent a dinosaur [01:02:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

*   **Angkor Wat Carving**: [[Ancient Indian Temples and Architecture | Angkor Wat]], an 11th-century Hindu temple complex in Cambodia, features a clear carving of a Stegosaurus on a temple doorway [01:03:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. This is notable as dinosaurs were not scientifically discovered until the 19th and 20th centuries [01:04:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

## Prophecies and Future Concepts

### Kalki Avatar
Many world mythologies share common threads, such as the global deluge, thunder gods, and the universal egg [01:05:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Another common concept is the return of a Messiah or savior [01:05:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>). In [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Hinduism]], this is the [[Kalki Avatar | Kalki Avatar]], who is prophesied to return at the end of the Kali Yuga [01:07:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. Other religions have similar concepts:
*   Tibetan Buddhism refers to the "Kikkala Kings" and the future Buddha, Maitreya [01:06:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   Christianity speaks of the return of the Messiah [01:07:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>).
*   Islam also has a concept of a returning Prophet [01:07:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>).

These shared beliefs may represent an ancient prophecy from a time when humanity was not culturally fragmented, or simply a universal hope for a better future [01:08:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

## The Importance of Curiosity and Re-discovery

The [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | Rig Veda's Nasadiya Sukta]] concludes with a profound thought: "Maybe [God] only knows how creation happened, what happened, how did things progress, but the next line is or maybe even he does not" [01:09:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This highlights the scientific inquiry inherent in [[Hinduism and ancient scriptures | Indian religious texts]], emphasizing that true knowledge means acknowledging what one does not know [01:10:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

There is a vast amount of [[Indian culture | Indian culture]] and [[Ancient Vedic Scriptures and their Scientific Interpretations | mythology]] beyond the [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Mahabharata]] and [[Ancient Indian Epics Mahabharata and Ramayana | Ramayana]], including lost history for which archaeological evidence has not yet been discovered [01:10:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>). The destruction of libraries like Nalanda University during invasions resulted in immense loss of knowledge [00:49:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. Re-discovering this knowledge is crucial for future generations [01:11:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

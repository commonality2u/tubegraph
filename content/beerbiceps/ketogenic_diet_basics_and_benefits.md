The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a dietary approach that requires careful management of macronutrient intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## What is the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | Ketogenic Diet]]?

The core principle of the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is to keep daily carbohydrate intake below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It is not a fixed diet plan; calories must be progressively reduced each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Dietary Adjustments

Initially, followers can consume greasy foods as long as the 20-gram carb limit is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, as the diet progresses and calories become very low, fat intake must be reduced to stay below maintenance calories and promote fat burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. At this later stage, food should not be excessively greasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

A notable effect of the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is a reduced appetite, making it less feasible to consume as many meals as on other diet plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Protein Supplements
For protein shakes, using water instead of milk is recommended for optimal [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] adherence, though some dairy can be afforded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Isolate protein supplements are preferred due to their low carb and calorie content, and faster absorption compared to whey protein concentrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While whey protein concentrate is acceptable, isolate is suggested for stricter adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Essential Vegetables
A critical aspect of the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is filling the 20-gram carb allowance with green leafy vegetables like lettuce, cabbage, and spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Carbs from all ingredients, including garlic, must be meticulously counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Skipping these vegetables can lead to nutrient deficiencies and severe constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Protein Variety
It's important to vary protein sources in a high-protein diet, as different sources offer distinct [[benefits_and_downsides_of_ketosis | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Seafood is particularly beneficial for muscle recovery, especially during [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Red meat, while acceptable on a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] due to its fat content, should ideally not be consumed daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## General Principles

*   **Duration** The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] should be followed for a minimum of 30 days to see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Psychological Strength** Executing a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] requires significant psychological strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Suitability** The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] is not suitable for everyone, especially those with a strong preference for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

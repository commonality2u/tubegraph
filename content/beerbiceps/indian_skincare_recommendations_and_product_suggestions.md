This article outlines a [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] that applies to various skin types, including oily, dry, or regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The recommendations are based on honest advice, prioritizing [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | natural products]] and consumer knowledge over sponsored content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Following this routine can help prevent acne, blemishes, skin bumps, irritation, and other skin problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

### Frequency
It is recommended to wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before going to bed and once in the morning after waking up or arriving at work/college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you engage in cardio or activities like football or cricket that cause a lot of sweating, you can wash your face a third time after your session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Ideally, stick to twice a day and only go to thrice on occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Product Recommendations
Always aim to use a 100% herbal face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Be cautious of big brands claiming to be Ayurvedic, as many only contain Ayurvedic ingredients and are not entirely herbal or natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Recommended brands for 100% natural, Ayurvedic, herbal products:
*   **Budget-friendly**: Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   **Premium**: Kama Ayurveda, Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

Specific products mentioned:
*   Rose water face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

### [[methods_for_applying_skincare_products_properly | Application Method]]
The following steps apply to all types of face washes, whether herbal, normal, chemical, or mild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>:
1.  **Timing**: Preferably wash your face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to clean and close them more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Herbal face washes also provide nutrition to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Amount**: Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or a small amount of gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  **Application**: Rub the product between your hands and apply it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
4.  **Regions and Motion**: Focus on three main regions, applying the face wash in a circular motion for about 15 seconds per region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:
    *   Cheeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
    *   Chin and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   T-area (forehead, nose, chin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
    Circular motion increases blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes growth, and helps clean dirt better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Avoid rubbing up and down, as it can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Be gentle but firm with your strokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
5.  **Sitting Time**: For herbal face washes, let the product sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to work its magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
6.  **Rinsing**: Wash off the face wash with room temperature or tepid (slightly hotter than room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Avoid hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Natural Moisturizers

Natural moisturizers are preferred over chemically made ones because chemical products can clog pores, increase acne, and destroy beneficial bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Natural options do not harm the good bacteria that fight acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Essential Tools
*   Cotton balls: Always use clean cotton balls for application to avoid transferring dirty bacteria from your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Recommended Natural Moisturizers
*   **Rose Water**: Acts as a disinfectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Apply it twice a day: once before heading out and once before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Khadi is a recommended brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice**: Apply once to twice a week, as it is stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It helps fight acne and reduces blemishes like black marks left by acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. If it stings too much, mix it with a little water; stinging indicates it's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera**: A powerful medicinal plant, the pulp of which is very beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. You can scrape the pulp from an aloe vera plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Mix it with lime water or apply it directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. It can cause a slight stinging sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Use once or twice a week, especially for extremely dry skin or bad acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products

While natural moisturizers provide long-term [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | anti-acne]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, specific products are recommended for active pimples or breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Cautions
*   **Antibiotics (e.g., Clinda)**: While effective for fresh pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, overuse of antibiotics can destroy the good bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Use them only if other methods don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Recommended Short-Term Anti-Acne Solutions
Prioritize natural herbal oils, specifically low-density skin oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Low-Density Oils**: These oils are formulated for skin and pimples, unlike dense oils (like coconut oil) which can clog pimples and worsen them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. They are absorbed by the pimple, reducing inflammation and redness, and helping the pimple heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   Sweet almond oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
    *   Rosehip oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
    *   Tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>

## [[diet_lifestyle_and_stress_management_for_skincare | Diet and Lifestyle Factors]]

For optimal skin health, diet and lifestyle play crucial roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Diet
*   Quit sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   Reduce junk food or restaurant meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Avoid packaged fried snacks, especially those high in maida (refined flour) and unhealthy oils/trans fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Include more vegetables and fruits in your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   Avoid overdoing any single type of food, including non-vegetarian items, eggs, or specific vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Lifestyle
*   **Stress Management**: High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin quality, aging, and increases oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. To reduce cortisol long-term:
    *   Focus on sleep hygiene (quality of sleep) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   Practice meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
Both meditation and quality sleep can reduce stress and improve skin quality significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

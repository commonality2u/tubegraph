Intermittent fasting, a phenomenon that has gained global recognition, is not a new concept; it has always existed throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Historically, a fasting mechanism and a feasting mechanism are built into the human body, stemming from evolutionary patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Unlike the modern idea of breakfast, which was designed by breakfast cereal companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, true fasting practices have been present in various cultures and religions, including Islam, Hinduism, and the Bible, as a means to maintain physical, emotional, and spiritual health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. It serves as a cleanse for both the physical and mental body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Intermittent Fasting

[[Science of intermittent fasting and its impact on metabolism | Intermittent fasting]] is touted as the most inexpensive, cheapest, and free method to achieve various health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

*   **Weight Loss & Immunity**: It is effective for weight loss, boosting immunity, and reducing inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Skin & Hair Health**: It improves the condition of skin and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Sleep**: It leads to deeper and better sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Patients on [[science_of_intermittent_fasting_and_its_impact_on_metabolism | intermittent fasting]] often report sleeping better without the need for pills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Energy**: Users experience a dramatic increase in energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Cravings**: It automatically reduces the appetite for stimulants, sugar, and junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. This happens because the body starts running on cellular energy, which involves the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, leading to significant energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. A clean body naturally craves clean foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Balance**: It can help manage fluctuating sugar levels under supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Support for Serious Conditions**: Even chemotherapy patients who fasted experienced reduced nausea and improved white blood cell counts, attributed to a boosted immune system and reduced inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Body's Self-Healing**: It enables the body to heal itself by harnessing its innate intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## How to Practice Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting should not be treated as a fad diet, where people strictly adhere to ratios like 16:8 (16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

*   **Listen to Your Body**: The key is to listen to your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
    *   If you're not hungry, don't eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. If you are hungry, eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
    *   After a good night's sleep, the body is in detoxification mode; eating stops this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Wait for a physical craving for hunger before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Fasting Windows**:
    *   A minimum of 12 hours of fasting is sufficient to gain benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. For example, if you finish dinner at 8 PM and eat breakfast at 8 AM, you are already doing a 12-hour fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
    *   If you're not hungry at 8 AM, extend your fast to 9, 10, or 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
    *   Do not compare your fasting duration to others; some people fast every day, others once a week or every 15 days, and all can derive benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   It's important to understand that every day is different, and your body's needs may vary based on factors like mental work or stress, which require more calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **During the Fast**:
    *   A true fast means consuming only water to shut down the digestive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
    *   Avoid acidic stimulants like coffee during a fast, as they interfere with the body's cleaning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   If hunger strikes during the fast, drink water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. After the initial one or two difficult days, the body's physiology changes, making subsequent fasts easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Important Considerations**:
    *   [[Science of intermittent fasting and its impact on metabolism | Intermittent fasting]] may not suit everyone, especially individuals with different metabolisms, such as highly diabetic individuals with fluctuating sugar levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
    *   Individuals with kidney issues or fluctuating sugar levels should practice it under supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
    *   Making an informed judgment and doing it wisely is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
    *   It requires retraining the body, which takes some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Once mastered, many people no longer need a specific diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

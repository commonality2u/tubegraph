In [[indias_political_landscape | India's political landscape]], elections are a critical barometer of public sentiment and the effectiveness of political strategies. Dr. Subramanian Swamy offers a candid assessment of various aspects of this process, from leadership styles to economic policies and their impact on voter behavior and the [[future_of_indias_democracy | future of India's democracy]].

## The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

Dr. Subramanian Swamy, a long-time member of the BJP, identifies several issues within the party's current functioning and leadership.

### Leadership and Internal Dynamics
According to Swamy, Prime Minister Modi "tells lies" and "claims credit for people who have done the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. An example cited is the Ram Temple project, where Swamy claims he was responsible for getting the Supreme Court to clear it, but Modi took all the credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Swamy states he has had no interaction with PM Modi since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Regarding the party's internal structure, Swamy asserts that the BJP's original, fine party constitution, which allowed for regular elections and changes in presidency through voting, has been "thoroughly disrupted by Mr. Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. He claims that "everything is nominated by Modi," leading to a cabinet largely comprised of individuals who lack a "spine" and will not "do anything which annoys Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. He names only two current cabinet members, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, as exceptions who "can stand up" and speak frankly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The internal dynamic is described as a "Modi and then Sano Panza" (Man Friday) scenario, with Amit Shah as the "Man Friday" and the rest simply obeying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

### Hindutva and Public Perception
Despite his criticisms of Modi, Swamy remains in the BJP because of his deep roots in the Hindu movement and his ability to articulate the ideology of Hindutva effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. He is considered a "Hindu scholar" and "Hindu activist" who has championed causes like saving the Ram Setu and liberating temples from government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. He believes that the BJP would "definitely win only on the Hindutva issue" without Mr. Modi as the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

Swamy argues that being pro-Hindutva does not automatically mean being anti-Muslim, citing his own family, including a Muslim son-in-law, as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. He believes the shared DNA of Indian Muslims and Hindus (whose ancestors were Hindu) points to a common culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. He aims to unite Hindus by helping them understand their "real history" and religion, dispelling falsehoods perpetuated during the British and Mughal periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## The Indian National Congress

Swamy provides a critical perspective on the Congress party, particularly its post-Rajiv Gandhi leadership.

### Historical Allegations
He states that "from Jawaharlal Nehru's time there has been a deliberate attempt to create a situation where the Muslims feel that they only safe with the Congress party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. He alleges that Congress "pampered" Muslims, giving them "goodies" and ensuring police were "well disposed towards them" if they supported the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. This, he argues, led to the consolidation of Hindus and the rise of the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Swamy also claims that "most of the riots were ignited by the Congress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

### Criticisms of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
Swamy describes Sonia Gandhi as "hopeless" and someone who "has been working for all the anti-Indian forces in the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. He also mentions prosecuting her for [[corruption_in_indian_politics | corruption]] in the National Herald case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. He claims she "bluffed about her education" and was "unfit to hold any office in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. Swamy credits himself and then-President Abdul Kalam with preventing her from becoming Prime Minister by finding a technicality to stop her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.

Rahul Gandhi is called an "idiot" by Swamy, who believes he "can say anything at any time" and does not genuinely want to be in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. He suggests that the Gandhi family remains in politics due to alleged past crimes, making it "essential for their survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

In contrast, Swamy praises Rajiv Gandhi as a "wonderful man" who was "nationalistic" and "built the Indian army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. He also commends Rajiv Gandhi for allowing the Ramayan to be shown on television and permitting the Vishva Hindu Parishad to begin digging at the Ayodhya site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

## Economic and Strategic Policy in Elections

Economic policy and strategic decisions are crucial for India's future and are often central to election campaigns.

### Economic Growth and Fiscal Policy
Swamy challenges the government's claimed GDP growth rate of 8-9%, stating it is "not more than 4%" when inflation is accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. He attributes much of the reported growth to the evaluation of GDP at current prices, which includes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. He predicts that if PM Modi remains in power, India will face a "massive depression" by 2030, similar to the 1930s Great Depression in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

He criticizes current policies for raising income tax rates, hiking interest rates, and neglecting the demand side of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. Swamy advocates for abolishing income tax to boost demand, suggesting that the money could be placed in banks with a 9% interest rate to encourage savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. He argues that income tax is primarily paid by the middle and upper-middle classes, who are the "innovators" and "educated people" and suffer from its burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. He asserts that income tax collections are often siphoned off into "personal pockets" of income tax officials and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

### Foreign Policy and National Security
Swamy asserts that India's [[Indias_Foreign_Policy | foreign policy]] under PM Modi is entirely dictated by him, lacking a clear non-aligned stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. He criticizes the government's handling of Chinese incursions in Ladakh, claiming that 4,065 square kilometers of undisputed territory have been occupied since 2020, contrary to the Prime Minister's statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Swamy suggests that PM Modi might be "blackmailed" by China, preventing him from taking stronger action like expelling the Chinese Ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. He believes India has the potential to be a "first factor" globally, but its current standing is "less than third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. Achieving this requires 10% annual economic growth and militarily defeating China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## Elections and the [[future_of_indias_democracy | Future of India's Democracy]]

Looking ahead to upcoming elections, Swamy offers strong opinions.

### Electoral Predictions and Candidate Choice
Swamy predicts that the BJP "will win" the coming election but would prefer to see Modi "either not contest or lose in the contest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. He views Modi as "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" due to a perceived lack of values and a belief in "dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>, comparing him to Hitler and Putin in terms of initial democratic appearance turning into authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. He also expresses concern that if Modi is re-elected, he will aim to ensure "no more elections for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.

### Transparency and Media's Role
Swamy highlights a lack of transparency in the current government, citing the electoral bonds controversy as a "mighty scandal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. He also alleges that the Prime Minister's Office has effectively "shut up" the media, preventing publication of critical news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

### Public Awareness and Participation
He observes that the Indian masses have become "very sharp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a> and emphasizes the importance of citizens gaining multiple inputs and perspectives when forming their political opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. Swamy encourages more independent, educated individuals to enter politics, as they are less susceptible to fear and financial pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. He notes a positive trend of more people with PhDs entering politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>, contributing to India "shaping up very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in Politics

Swamy shares insights on navigating the complexities and perceived "dirt" of politics.

### Personal Philosophy
Swamy attributes his fearlessness to his philosophical approach, stating that reading the Bhagavad Gita teaches one not to be fearful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. He believes in focusing on action, trusting that results are ultimately determined by God, which fosters a sense of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. He maintains his goal is to serve his country, wanting to see India become a "very strong country which has recovered all the lost property of India" and grows at 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>.

### Resilience and Experience
Recounting his experience during the Emergency of 1975-1977, Swamy details how he escaped abroad to campaign against Mrs. Gandhi's regime and later returned to India, evading arrest despite 18 cases against him and an Interpol notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. He delivered a one-minute speech in Parliament before disappearing again, which he believes "completely smashed Mrs. Gandhi's" perception of control and contributed to her decision to call elections, which she subsequently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. This demonstrates his deep understanding of political strategy and his personal resilience in challenging circumstances.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas, a global icon, shares insights into navigating the multifaceted challenges of the entertainment industry, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, humility, and a positive mindset. Her journey illustrates a shift from early career romanticization of relentless work to a balanced, purpose-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Work Ethic and Balance

Early in her career, Chopra observed a romanticized view of success tied to working "24 hours," "don't sleep, don't eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach was believed to lead to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, with more life experience, she realized the critical importance of work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Taking breaks, like a recent trip to Turks and Caicos where phones were off, allowed her to return feeling "rejuvenated, feeling excited and really motivated to take my career forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

She refutes the notion that work must be "tough and work has to be rough," instead advocating that "work can be your companion, work can be creative, work can be something that gives you Joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Maintaining a clear separation between professional and personal life, such as switching off to be with family, watching movies, and doing personal activities, allows for renewed focus and productivity when returning to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Navigating New Territories and Public Perception

Priyanka Chopra's move to America presented a unique set of [[acting_career_challenges | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Despite an "incredible career" and "amazing credibility" in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, she had to [[overcoming_challenges_in_early_career | start from scratch]] in a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. It took her 10 years, from 2010 to 2020, to secure her first leading role in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This period demanded:
*   **Hard work and consistent effort**: "How much hard work, how much consistent knocking on doors, how much humility it takes to go to another country and start from scratch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Extreme humility**: She had to "strip every single thing that I knew in India and The Laurels that I had achieved" to "walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of small roles**: Many people criticized her for doing "small roles in Hollywood" after being a Bollywood star, but she recognized that "every new actor starts there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Adapting to a new culture**: It was necessary to "work around the culture of a new country," which she describes as "so hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### [[dealing_with_public_attention_and_celebrity_life | Dealing with Public Scrutiny]] and Gender Disparity
Chopra notes the difficulty of being a public figure, where one is "dinner table conversation every single day" and opinions, whether "good, bad, [or] ugly," are beyond one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. She advises against dwelling on negative comments or paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

A significant [[acting_career_challenges | challenge]] she faced was the prevalent gender pay gap. It wasn't until 2020, after 21 years in the industry, that she finally received "the same renumeration as a man," something she "never did in Bollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Mindset and Personal Growth

Priyanka Chopra emphasizes several key aspects for [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | personal growth]] and [[pursuing_passion_despite_challenges | overcoming challenges]]:

*   **Self-awareness and Honesty**: She considers herself "very astute when it comes to I don't lie to myself, I'm very honest to myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, which helped her pivot from music in the US when she realized it wasn't her "standard of Excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Gratitude and Giving Back**: She wakes up daily with a "sense of gratitude" and a desire to "give back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, believing her blessings are a result of doing "something right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Fighting Negativity and External Pressure**:
    > "You have to shut off the noise. There are many people that'll want to pull you down but don't focus on that, focus on the one person that believes in you, focus on the light little sliver of light that you might see, a little bit of inspiration that you might see and that's the hardest thing to do because you're bogged down by baggage, you're bogged down by shackles of people holding you down so you have to really push forward and that's just individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Embracing Aging**: Chopra urges against stressing about aging, calling it a "glass ceiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. She highlights examples like Falguni Nayar, who started Nykaa at 50, to prove that "age ain't nothing but a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. What matters is "what you do about your life in the moment right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Surrounding Oneself with Champions**: She strongly advises removing "poisonous people" and "toxic" influences from one's life, instead keeping "people around you that are genuinely happy for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   **Defining Success Personally**: Chopra asserts that "success is very subjective to each person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Her meaning of life is "having purpose" and creating a legacy between birth and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Journey: Anomaly
Driven by her mother's foresight about the limited shelf life for actresses in Bollywood after 30, Chopra ventured into production and later became an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Her entrepreneurial journey, especially with her brand Anomaly, stemmed from an interest in the "business of entertainment" and a desire to "monetize" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Anomaly, her first self-founded brand, aims to provide high-quality, sustainable, and affordable hair care products by using recycled plastic packaging, which allows for investment in excellent formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This venture highlights her belief in creating value and addressing market gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. She sees this as a new beginning, constantly pushing boundaries and creating her "own luck" through hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

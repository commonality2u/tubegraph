An actress shares her candid views on the challenges and realities of being a public figure, emphasizing the loss of privacy, constant scrutiny, and the emotional toll of fame.

## The Reality of Fame
The actress admits she does not particularly enjoy the "fame part" of her profession, though she finds it humbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. She describes herself as a "non-film person" to those who know her closely, noting that people often comment that she doesn't act like an actress or heroine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Unlike some others in the industry, she has never cultivated an "air" around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. While she enjoys being in front of the camera, everything else that comes with fame feels like a liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Public Life
### Loss of Privacy and Vulnerability
A significant challenge of fame is the complete lack of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Many believe that becoming an actor is empowering and makes one invincible, but the actress contends that it actually makes a person much more vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The constant moral policing in life is amplified "a zillion fold" for actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Every step she takes must be considered from the perspective of "what will people think," a sentiment she believes has ruined many lives, as evidenced by memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This directly relates to [[dealing_with_fame_media_perceptions_and_public_scrutiny | dealing with fame, media perceptions, and public scrutiny]].

### Public Scrutiny and Appearance
Actors face immense pressure regarding their appearance. It is exhausting to always be presentable, as they do not wake up looking "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. There is a high expectation at all times; even if an actor is having a bad day, is sick, or going through something traumatizing, people will still approach them for a selfie, and they are expected to oblige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. This highlights the difficulties of [[dealing_with_public_attention_and_celebrity_life | dealing with public attention and celebrity life]].

The actress recounts an incident where, immediately after recovering from Corona and being on heavy medication, people called her to say she was "looking a little fat" in her pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She found this insensitivity shocking, questioning "what is wrong with people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Gendered Pressures in the Industry
While both male and female actors face pressures, they differ. Actresses experience significant pressure on their looks and presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>. Male actors, however, often face "worse" pressures related to the substantial amount of money riding on their films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>. The failure of one film can lead to immense criticism and a decline in market value, making it difficult for them to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.

Actors also have limited control over the final content of a film, despite giving inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>. This is unlike content creators like YouTubers who have full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>. The actress describes acting as a "laborious job" that requires one to be physically, emotionally, and mentally "there," unlike a desk job where appearance might not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05:00">[43:05:00]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms and Personal Philosophy
### Embracing the Present and Small Joys
The actress has realized that complete happiness is elusive and there will always be "some void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. To cope, she consciously focuses on enjoying the small things, like eating a bag of chips with friends, wearing casual clothes, and being without makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This demonstrates her approach to [[balancing_personal_life_and_public_persona | balancing personal life and public persona]].

The lockdown provided a reality check, shifting her focus from long-term goals to the importance of each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. She aims to be fully present in every moment, like during interviews, rather than thinking about other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Maintaining Authenticity and Humility
Despite achieving fame, the actress remains connected to her authentic self from before fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. She believes that circumstances like fame, name, and money reveal a person's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Her choice to remain herself was simply because she "didn't know any better" and "didn't want to do anything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This reflects her practice of [[balancing_fame_and_humility | balancing fame and humility]].

### Finding Peace
The actress is actively searching for inner peace, acknowledging that she has little control over external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. She works constantly, often without typical weekends, and views Saturday and Sunday as a "concept" she has recently introduced into her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

She believes that external factors like wealth and fame do not lead to peace; in fact, they can add to the "craziness" and make it more difficult to achieve inner calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Peace, she notes, is an "inside job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Insecurity and Jealousy
She notes that self-made actors, despite their success, often carry a deep-rooted insecurity, fearing loss of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This insecurity can sometimes fuel their creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

The actress senses jealousy from others in the industry, which is often masked by overly sweet behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>. She believes a "status game mentality" is prevalent in Indian society, where people may want to pull others down if their "shit's going well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:19:00">[49:19:00]</a>. This stems from a lack of valuing what they have and a competitive drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>.

### Post-COVID Reflections and Wisdom
Her personal experience with COVID-19, which required hospitalization, highlighted the loneliness of dealing with major life events and the importance of family support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:00">[37:41:00]</a>. It taught her to give "time and effort" to what truly matters in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>.

She feels like a new person after this experience, unable to "fake it anymore" and expressing her true feelings directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>. Her philosophy includes:
*   There's no "right time"; the right time is now, so "take action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   "Don't try too hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   Seize every moment to be happy, focusing on small things that are within one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

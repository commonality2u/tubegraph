Dr. S. Somnath, the chairperson of ISRO, holds a strong belief in the existence of [[the_concept_of_higher_beings_and_entities | extraterrestrial life]] and the possibility of alien visits to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. He states, "Absolutely. No doubt about it. There are aliens out in the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This perspective is rooted in his understanding of the universe's vastness and the concept of evolution on a cosmic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

## Evolution and Intelligence
Dr. Somnath emphasizes the rapid technological progress humanity has made in just the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. He postulates that if another civilization were even 200 years behind or 1,000 years ahead of humanity, their level of advancement would be astonishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. A society 10,000 years ahead in technology would be so evolved that they could frequently visit Earth without humanity even knowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. From their perspective, humans might be akin to "lions in a zoo," or they might "treat you like an earthworm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

## Possibility of Life on Exosolar Planets
ISRO actively studies celestial bodies, including black holes, using satellites like Xposat (X-ray Polarometer Satellite) and AstroSat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

Dr. Somnath notes that over 5,000 exosolar planets have been discovered, and about 100 of these are potentially capable of sustaining life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Some of these planets might already be habitable, possessing Earth-like temperatures, water, and atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While their atmospheric oxygen levels might differ, they could be changed over time to become suitable for human habitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. However, traveling to these planets would require tremendously high speeds to reach them within a human lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Risks of Contact with Extraterrestrials
Despite the fascination, Dr. Somnath expresses a preference "never to be in touch with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. His reasoning is primarily biological:
*   Earth's life forms share a common biology and genome structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   Life evolved on another planet might have an entirely different biological and chemical composition (e.g., breathing methane instead of oxygen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   Contact between such fundamentally different life forms could be dangerous, as one might inevitably "overtake" and "destroy" the other, unless they possess a higher conscience to remain disconnected physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

## UFO Sightings and Their Explanations
Dr. Somnath addresses the common observation that UFOs are primarily reported in America and South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. He provides both scientific and non-scientific reasons:
*   **Scientific:** UFO observations are more feasible in northern and southern latitudes due to clearer skies, whereas equatorial regions (like India and Africa) are often cloudy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Phenomena like auroras and solar effects are also predominantly seen in northern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Non-Scientific:** Americans have a tendency to "detect so many things all around and make a story out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He believes many UFO stories are fabricated, though he cannot definitively comment on the true ones as he has not witnessed them himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

He dismisses theories such as "lizard people" or "Anunnaki" having taken human form and living among us, stating he has no solution for how such biologically different beings could coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

## Search for Alien Signals
ISRO does not possess satellites with the capability to detect faint signals from established civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. Such detection is typically done by ground-based radio telescopes and frequency scanners in observatories (e.g., in Pune, India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

While he has read articles and books about potential faint signals, he does not have firsthand information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. He acknowledges that observed patterns could be from civilizations, or they could be natural electromagnetic noise from celestial systems like supernovas or spinning black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

## Skepticism and the Inner Child
Dr. Somnath appreciates the curiosity that drives discussions about aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He notes that such topics are often "rejected by large sections of society" who are taught to "kill off their inner child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. However, he believes maintaining that childlike curiosity is crucial for imagination, creativity, and scientific discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. He distinguishes between being "scientific," which discovers the unknown, and "scientistic," which rejects it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

Scientists at ISRO do discuss [[mythological_and_scientific_study_of_vimanas_and_aliens | extraterrestrial life]] and related topics in their free time, especially among younger colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

### Spirituality and the Universe
Dr. Somnath finds the universe's expansion and the nature of light profoundly spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. He describes the phenomenon where light emitted from an individual continues to travel through the expanding universe, allowing someone billions of years later to potentially "see us living talking to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This realization makes him "speechless" and more spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>, making him feel how small humans are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

He views the "omnipotent God" as the universe itself, existing because it desires to "feel itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. Humanity's purpose is to experientially know the universe in its different facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

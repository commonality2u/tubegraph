The unique career of Captain Ragu, an officer who served in the Indian Army, provides insight into the intense training and profound psychological aspects of [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military life]] and combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His journey highlights the transformation of individuals through rigorous preparation for warfare and the enduring impact of such experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

## Soldier's Mentality

The Indian Army maintains a professional stance, even towards adversaries. For instance, in the Kargil War, the Indian Army issued gallantry award citations for Pakistani officers, acknowledging their commendable fighting as soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demonstrates a deep-seated respect from soldier to soldier, transcending enemy lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Captain Ragu emphasizes that there is generally no personal animosity between professional soldiers, as they act under governmental orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Disrespecting an enemy is considered foolish, as it can lead to overconfidence and mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Soldiers worldwide are generally equally good, patriotic, and possess a strong sense of honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

## Military Training and Mental Fortitude

Army training is designed to prepare leaders to operate under conditions of high stress, often involving the risk of losing one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. This training is described as extremely intense, focusing on the "art of killing" rather than "the art of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

### The Purpose of Intense Training
The core purpose of intense [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military training]] is to enable individuals to function under extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It's about building a unit that works with precise synchronization, almost moving at the speed of sound, minimizing margins of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The rigorous drills, like those performed on the parade ground, are not just for military bearing but to instill absolute coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The [[special_forces_mindset_and_training | Commando course]], for instance, is 35 days and nights of "pure hell," aiming to build [[mindset_and_training_of_special_forces_soldiers | mental fortitude]] rather than just physical fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The instructors teach that if a soldier can survive the Commando course, they can survive anything, fostering resilience for future challenges like being captured or tortured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

> "any time in your life when you're going through a mess, when you're going through a challenge, you be captured by the Enemy being tortured, you must remember that you survived the Commando course and if you have survived the Commando course you will survive anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>

The training introduces shock, fear, trauma, and exhaustion, pushing the mind to solve problems in [[combat_scenarios_and_survival_instincts | combat situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Psychological Aspects
The Indian Army employs intense psychometric testing during recruitment to assess "officer-like qualities" or [[leadership_and_responsibility_in_intense_combat_situations | leadership qualities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This testing aims to identify individuals who can lead a team, even if others are more skilled, and prevent those who might "mess things up" under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. While not foolproof, it helps filter candidates based on their ability to handle stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Historically, the concept of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was not as understood, and young officers might have been told to simply "shake it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. However, modern armies, including the Indian Army, are becoming more empathetic towards the mental well-being of soldiers, recognizing that trauma is a natural response to unnatural demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### The Nature of Battle
Soldiers do not look forward to war because they understand the brutal reality and pain inflicted by bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. However, they recognize that combat is what they have trained for, similar to a cricketer training for a match, even knowing the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. There is a cautious eagerness to participate in battle, and officers often volunteer to join their units in operational areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

When battle begins, the experience can be a "daze" or a "blur," where muscle memory and training take over amidst chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. The most significant fear for a leader in combat is not personal harm, but rather the apprehension of whether they will be worthy of command and able to lead their troops effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

> "It's not so much the fear of what can happen to me I lose my leg when will I die and all of that I I think that is a fear of course but the bigger fear is that will I be able to will I be able to do it will I be able to hold the responsibility given to me will I have the courage at that point of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>

The burden of command, knowing that one's actions can lead to the death of others and having to face their families, weighs heavily on a leader's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This transition from fear of a situation to confident problem-solving in a dicey situation is crucial for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

### Physical Courage
[[Leadership and responsibility in intense combat situations | Physical courage]] is an essential trait for military leaders, defined as the ability to put oneself in physical danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. It extends beyond facing bullets to enduring hardship and maintaining spirit, as seen in prisoners of war subjected to interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Civilian vs. Military Perspective on War
Films often romanticize war, focusing on entertainment and bravado, which differs significantly from the painful reality of combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. Losing a person in combat devastates families, highlighting that "mistakes come home in body bags," unlike in corporate settings where targets can be missed without such dire consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Peacekeeping Missions
[[Military experiences in international settings | UN peacekeeping missions]], such as Captain Ragu's tenure in Angola, differ from direct combat operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Here, the focus is on inspiring troops to act as "brand ambassadors of India" and exercising restraint, which can be more nerve-wracking than actual combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. The objective is to enforce peace agreements and rebuild countries by providing administrative, observational, and combat support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

Captain Ragu realized the profound contribution of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach to India's freedom after witnessing Angola's history of achieving freedom through violence, which led to continued internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. This contrast highlighted the strengths of India's cultural approach to protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

## Post-Combat Transformation

Surviving [[combat_scenarios_and_survival_instincts | intense combat situations]] or life-threatening events changes an individual's perspective on life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. It emphasizes the fragility of life and the temporal nature of possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This often leads to a deeper appreciation for blessings and less stress over trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

### [[Philosophical insights and spiritual aspects of being a soldier | Spirituality and Brotherhood]]
In fearful situations, spirituality becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. Soldiers often become more religious when deployed to challenging areas like glaciers, partly because they are "literally closer to God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. This spiritual connection, distinct from religion, provides solace and a sense of peace when facing death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. Battalions often have spiritual teachers, and pre-combat rituals like Pujas are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

The trauma and shared intense experiences in military training forge lifelong bonds and an intense sense of brotherhood among soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This creates a strong support system where individuals can confess anything to their "buddy" and rely on a larger "family" within the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Lessons from the Army
The Army provides a unique form of "enhanced experience of life," exposing individuals to various parts of the country, cultures, and challenges that deepen their understanding of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It teaches accelerated learning, enabling soldiers to quickly master sophisticated technologies and adapt to new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. This confidence in learning new skills is transferable to various civilian professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>.

The military also imparts valuable life lessons, such as contentment with "enough" resources and the importance of relationships over material wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. It exposes individuals to different social strata, fostering gratitude for their own blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

When discussing [[impacts_of_spiritual_guidance_in_leadership_and_success | personal success]] and achieving goals, many successful individuals identify a "spiritual anchor" in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This concept isn't necessarily tied to traditional religion or a specific deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For some, it manifests as a strong belief in the power of their thoughts and intentions.

## Manifestation as a Spiritual Anchor

A key aspect of this [[role_of_spirituality_in_personal_and_professional_life | spiritual approach]] is the belief in manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This involves the idea that if you desire positive outcomes, they will eventually come to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. While results may not be immediate, consistency in intent often leads to desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

> "I believe a lot in manifestation and I feel like if you want good it happens. I've noticed this too many times in my life and my mom believes that my manifestation is very strong because when I want one thing it takes time, it doesn't happen exactly when I want it but it always comes to me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

## The Interplay of Energy and Effort

The principle behind manifestation suggests that the energies one projects into the world are reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. However, manifestation is not a passive process; it requires dedicated effort and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Simply wishing for something without actively working towards it is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It is crucial to maintain a positive mindset and focus on beneficial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

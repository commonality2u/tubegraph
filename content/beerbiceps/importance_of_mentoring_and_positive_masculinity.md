Mentors and [[developing_a_positive_mindset | positive masculinity]] can significantly aid one's life journey, "lubricating the entire process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. The episode featuring Sunil Shetty highlights the importance of older professionals as mentor figures, providing guidance not only in careers but also in emotional and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## The Value of Mentorship

The host believes that the current generation of millennials and Gen Z needs mentors, especially when entering their 30s or setting up careers in their mid-20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Sunil Shetty, despite his fame, is seen as a source of wisdom and a "B energy" (like a father figure) for younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. His approach to life, career, and family provides valuable lessons.

Key aspects of effective mentorship and positive influence include:
*   **Setting clear boundaries and control** Establishing rules and maintaining domain control is crucial for any conversation or endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This ensures meaningful engagement and prevents the "trash" content often seen in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Making a difference** Content should be designed to make a difference in someone's life, rather than merely chasing ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Honesty and authenticity** Being honest and authentic in one's interactions attracts "good people" who want to be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | reinvention]]** Even at 60, one should be re-looking and reinventing oneself, focusing on enjoyment and making endeavors meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Positive Masculinity in Action

Positive masculinity, as demonstrated by Sunil Shetty, encompasses various aspects of a balanced life:

### Prioritizing Health and Wellness
Sunil Shetty emphasizes health and wellness as a consistent factor in his life, regardless of career success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. His approach to physical appearance is rooted in a focus on "health and wellness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

His fitness and lifestyle routine is intertwined:
*   **Dietary Habits** Adhering to an "80% diet" with clean, home-cooked food is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. He avoids ordering from outside due to concerns about preservatives and unknown ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. He consciously avoids white foods like milk, white rice, salt, and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:02]</a>.
*   **Structured Training** He allocates "10% training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, training early for 45 minutes to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent Habits** His daily habits, which he attributes to "10% habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, include being "early to bed, early to rise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. He ensures he is up by 4-5 AM and aims to sleep by 10-10:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Supplementation** He prefers natural supplements and advises checking blood routines to understand individual body needs, rather than following general trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   **Age as a Number** He believes age is "just a number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a> and focuses on connecting with youth through discussions on health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Wisdom in Aging and [[Personal Growth and Overcoming Failure | Overcoming Failure]]
Growing older allows for greater wisdom and smarter decision-making, enabling one to "step back and become smarter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a> and "look better on screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. Every stage of life, from bachelorhood to grandparenthood, is described as beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

Goals should be set and manifested with implementation. Sunil Shetty aimed to be the "fittest 50 ever" and then focused on a "six-pack at 60," which he managed "through food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

Regarding failure, he notes that sometimes "higher powers are at play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>. His experience as an actor, initially deemed "wooden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>, led him to learn acting through "dead-defying stunts" that gave him a fan following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>. He believes his earlier self lacked "brains" and was "naive" or "far too innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:19]</a>. His later regrets about "choosing of the wrong subjects" and "believing that you were above the product itself" informed his decision to step back and understand his mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

### The Role of [[Importance of Family Values in Upbringing | Family Values]]
A strong marriage and family life significantly benefit mental health and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>. Sunil Shetty attributes his stability to a "very very strong family background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

Key family principles:
*   **Choosing the Right Partner** The partner chosen for marriage "really really matters a hell of a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. Sunil Shetty made the "most beautiful decision" to marry his wife, Mana, despite advice against it at the start of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. Her security and support in an "insecure world" were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.
*   **Respect and Trust in Partnership** Mental health thrives when partners respect and trust each other, allowing for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. It's about prioritizing the relationship and giving space for individual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Family Time** Sunil Shetty highlights the importance of "Sunday family time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, a lesson he learned from Danny Sa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. He has not worked on a Sunday for "donkeys years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>, dedicating this time to his family without distractions like phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
*   **Father-Child Relationships** It is often up to children to initiate conversations with their fathers, pouring their hearts out without expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. Sunil Shetty's relationship with his father, who taught him "never to lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>, and his own bond with his son Ahan, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
*   **Love for Work** Sunil Shetty's father taught him to "love your work like your own child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. This means investing time and effort, as a child will only miss you if you give them time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

### Generosity and Support
Being able to give, whether it's time or listening to someone, is crucial without expecting anything in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. As Sunil Shetty says, "from what you get you make a living, from what you give you can make a life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. He learned the value of giving from his mother-in-law, who taught him to give "without expecting anything in return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>. His commitment extends to supporting employees, even during challenging times like the pandemic, ensuring "five people extra working for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.

### Sports and Character Building
Sunil Shetty's regret about not playing cricket for the country highlights the [[impact_of_mentors_in_cricket | lessons learned from sports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:43:00">[44:43:00]</a>. He strongly advises parents to get children onto the ground to "learn to be a team man, woman," and "learn to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>. Early exposure to sports builds health and "confidence level[s]" that are invaluable in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:00">[45:18:00]</a>.

### The Role of [[Impacts of Spiritual Guidance in Leadership and Success | Spiritual Guidance]]
Sunil Shetty believes that his spiritual heritage, specifically the "House of Spirits" and "Kul DVI" (family deity), controls and shapes him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>. His regular attendance at pujas with his family demonstrates his deep connection to these traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. His belief in the "budh shastra" (Buddhist scriptures) as much as the "Giga shastra" (Bhagavad Gita) shows his open-minded approach to spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.

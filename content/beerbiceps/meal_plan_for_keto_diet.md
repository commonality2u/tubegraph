This article outlines a sample full day of eating while following a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], focusing on later stages when calories are reduced. It emphasizes that this is not a fixed plan and calorie intake should be continuously adjusted by reducing fat intake to stay under maintenance calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Initially, during the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], it's acceptable to consume super greasy food as long as the total daily carbohydrate intake remains below 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, as the diet progresses, fat intake needs to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The presented meal plan is for a phase where calories are very low, allowing for slightly oily food but not "extra greasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A key principle of the [[importance_of_low_carb_intake_in_keto | keto diet]] is maintaining a daily carbohydrate intake of only 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

On a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], appetite typically decreases, making it less feasible to consume as many meals as on other diet plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Sample Full Day of Eating

### Meal 1: Breakfast
A basic protein shake mixed with water is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While a small amount of dairy is permissible, it's best to avoid it for an ideal [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. An isolate protein supplement is preferred due to its low carb and calorie content and faster absorption compared to whey protein concentrates, though the latter is also acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Meal 2: Lunch
A simple Tawa Fried Chicken serves as a filling lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This consists of a chicken breast cut lengthwise, marinated in spices, and fried on a hot cast iron skillet with a small amount of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Approximately 100-150 grams of chicken breast is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Meal 3: Pre-Workout
About an hour before a workout, a simple four-egg omelet cooked with a minimal amount of oil is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It's crucial not to overdo the oil, as egg yolks contribute significant fat content, and exceeding maintenance calories should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While it might be challenging for those accustomed to high-carb pre-workout meals, the goal is simply to feel full before exercising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Post-Workout
After an intense workout, a protein shake with water is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Meal 4: Essential Veggies
This is considered the most crucial part of the [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It's important to fill the daily 20 grams of carbs with green leafy vegetables rather than options like cheese or dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. An example includes stir-fried lettuce, cabbage, and spinach with garlic and curry leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Carbs from all ingredients, including small garlic pods, should be meticulously counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Skipping this meal can lead to deficiencies and severe constipation, making it a health necessity despite its potential taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Meal 5: Dinner - Seafood
Seafood is a beneficial protein source for dinner, especially during [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto]], as it aids in muscle recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. An example given is Italian-style grilled baby prawns topped with extra virgin olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Regularly changing protein sources is advised to gain different benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Meal 6: Optional Late-Night Snack
For those who experience hunger at night, lamb seek kebabs are an optional meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While red meat shouldn't be consumed daily, it's permissible on a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] due to the allowance for extra fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Considerations for the Ketogenic Diet

*   A [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] must be followed for a minimum of 30 days to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Strong psychological discipline is required to successfully implement a [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   The [[overview_of_the_ketogenic_diet | keto diet]] may not be suitable for everyone, particularly individuals with a strong preference for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

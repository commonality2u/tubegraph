[[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | Demonic possession]] occurs when an individual shows vulnerability, allowing an entity to "latch on" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Demons can be found "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Dr. Savio Fado: Demonologist and Exorcist

Dr. Savio Fado is a demonologist and psychic, and a member of the same crew as Sarjit Mohanti and Puja Vijay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He primarily works as an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | exorcist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. His work is characterized by a skeptical approach, questioning everything that happens in haunted locations or during exorcisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. He would not readily believe someone claiming to be possessed or haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

He integrates various skills into his practice, including:
*   Handwriting analysis (graphology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
*   Reading symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>
*   NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   Hypnotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>
*   Face reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
*   Behavior analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>

These skills make it difficult to deny that "something more, something beyond this" exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Paranormal Investigations and Scouting

Dr. Fado's team conducts [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal investigations and research]] rather than "ghost hunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. Their method is scientific, utilizing devices that measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

Before an investigation, Dr. Fado performs:
*   **Scouting:** Visiting the location to check for anomalies, both spiritual and human interference (e.g., wild animals, goons, drunkards, druggists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Audit:** A spiritual assessment to determine if a place is genuinely haunted and worthy of investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Not every abandoned place or house where deaths occurred is haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

The most challenging aspect is proving a place is haunted and how it contributes to their research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Their goal is to understand darkness to help humanity move towards light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Psychic Abilities and Psychometry

Dr. Fado's psychic abilities developed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He is a psychometric person, meaning he can touch objects and surfaces to read their history and energy through nerve endings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. He interacts with elements like rocks and trees to get answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This information, when corroborated with facts and historical data, often proves true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. He believes spirituality is the science of the paranormal, suggesting a deeper scientific procedure involving human senses beyond the typical five, which could be harnessed to solve problems like crime cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

His journey to developing psychic abilities started with pattern recognition and observation of humans, leading to understanding their behavior, lying, and triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Learning hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) further developed his understanding of human manipulation and non-verbal communication, akin to "soft telepathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. He realized this extended to non-living objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

### Exorcism: A Deeper Look

Dr. Fado defines a demon as any unwanted sickness in the body, soul, or spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>. He views exorcism as going a step beyond mental health therapy, working in parallel with psychiatrists and psychologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

The first step in any exorcism is to diagnose and identify the specific demon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. Each demon has its own weakness that must be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>. The approach varies for each individual, as every person and mental illness is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:14]</a>. The process should be calm and relaxed, not dramatic like in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. An exorcism can last for a few hours, especially if the possessed person is unwilling to cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

During an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | exorcism]], fear is not an option, as demons feed off negative emotions like anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, fear, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. If a demon spots such emotions, it targets them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>. The afflicted person may not be aware of being possessed during the manic phase, but they realize their actions were wrong once calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.

### First Case of Demonic Possession

Dr. Fado's first direct [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | experience with demonic possession]] was an exorcism handled by his eldest brother around 2006 or 2007 in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. It was a religious exorcism using the Bible and scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>. He witnessed a frail young man, younger than himself, who could lift a sofa with one hand, puking and mouthing filthy language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. This experience showed him that such things truly happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

### The Most Challenging Case

The most challenging case Dr. Fado faced involved two boys who were acting demonically possessed and having manic phases synchronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. Both boys were half-brothers, sharing the same father who was having an extramarital affair with Dr. Fado's friend's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>. The father was also still engaged in "dirty" activities, and when he indulged, the boys would enter their manic phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. The father later committed suicide, and both boys stopped acting possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>. This case highlighted the importance of addressing the environment, not just the afflicted person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>.

### Weaker Entities and Misfortune

Demonic possession is not always physically localized or dramatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. Many people in the city may have weaker entities latched onto them without knowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>. Such possession can manifest as:
*   Misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>
*   Frequent accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>
*   Ventures not bearing fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>
*   Family fights or discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>

Just because someone doesn't "feel" a presence in a haunted place doesn't mean it's not there, similar to not seeing bacteria or viruses in a filthy place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.

### Understanding Demonic Entities and Ghosts

Demons are defined as free radicals of energy that gain spiritual memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. If the memory is positive, they form angels and spirit guides; if negative, they form demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. Some entities are neutral or "gray," causing confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

Demons can be categorized by their level of affliction:
*   **Fluid Level Demons:** Easily dispelled, like a cold or flu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>.
*   **Flesh Level Demons:** Take longer to heal, like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.
*   **Bone Level Demons:** Most permanent, difficult to heal, like fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>.
*   **Soul Level Demons:** Affect core energy, aura, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>. Aura can be easily manipulated, while consciousness takes longer to regain, as in a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>.
*   **Spirit Level Demons:** Affect motivation, conscience, and memory (the most permanent part of the spirit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:37:00">[54:37:00]</a>. These demons manipulate the mind, killing the conscience, and are considered more potent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02:00">[56:02:00]</a>. They may influence individuals to commit serial killings by convincing them that wrong actions are right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:31:00">[57:31:00]</a>. However, individuals are ultimately responsible for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>.

**Difference between a ghost and a demon:** A demon has never walked Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. Ghosts, in contrast, are the spirits of deceased humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Interaction with Entities

Entities are invisible and coexist with humans, similar to insects or rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. They become a "pest" when they disturb people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. Entities don't always want to scare or latch onto people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>; they only spend energy on those who recognize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

Many ghosts do not know they are dead and perceive humans as other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Investigators sometimes have to convince the entity of its death and tell it to cross over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. Some entities, even knowing they are ghosts, refuse to cross over due to unresolved desires, such as concern for kin, attachment to property, or seeking revenge for an unnatural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

Entities gather energy from EMF, light, air densities, plants, or other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Stronger entities can manipulate the physical realm, causing poltergeist activities like throwing objects or shattering glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.

### Cleansing and Protection

Dr. Fado ensures that entities do not latch onto him or follow him home after cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. He performs a "spiritual hygiene" cleanse at the location itself by going into a constant meditative state, increasing the density of his aura to drive off entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. He maintains a collection of "haunted" or "charged" [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | objects]] from cases, which he stores in his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Cleansing a place (not an exorcism) involves removing an entity, sometimes forcefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This is done through a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Before cleansing, they first rule out other anomalies like EMF pollution or Vastu issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

### Portals and Occult Practices

Mirrors can potentially act as portals or entryways to other dimensions, especially when placed facing each other, creating an endless loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Vastu and Feng Shui also advise against placing mirrors opposite each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Natural portals can form where multiple elements like water bodies or trees interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:82:00">[04:82:00]</a>. A house can become a portal if objects emitting EMF (e.g., inverter battery, Wi-Fi router, refrigerator) are placed in a specific configuration, like a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

**Ouija Boards** are described as kindergarten-level playthings that work on the "otor effect" (micro-muscle twitches) and draw information from the user's memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. However, they can also be manipulated by demons or dead entities from another zone, making them like "playing blind dates with evil entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. Entities will seek to interact if given an opportunity to communicate with the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:57">[01:23:57]</a>.

The concept of "occult" depends on intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. Chanting names like "Paymon" (a demon mentioned in the movie *Hereditary*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a> or "Bloody Mary" is not inherently wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>. If one intends for it to work and believes it will, it might, but otherwise, nothing will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>. Similarly, [[witchcraft_and_its_impacts | demonic chants]] in movies might only affect a person if it's "inborn in him" to take it in and practice it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

Any form of spirit communication, whether through a Ouija board, gadgets, or Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), is considered a response if it directly answers a provided stimulus, regardless of skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.

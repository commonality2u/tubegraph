Ajey Nagar, widely known by his YouTube persona "CarryMina," emphasizes the distinction between his public character and his private self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. While the CarryMina character is kept very open, Ajay Nagar maintains his personal life as entirely private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. He believes some parts of his personal life should not be shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## YouTube Journey

Ajey Nagar considers "CarryMina" a business, built from his personal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. His core aim is to continue his current path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, focusing on taking one day at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Growth
The biggest learning from his experience is the importance of continuous learning and gaining experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. He advocates for experiencing things in one's own way rather than solely relying on traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He believes that personal experience leads to a unique output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

To maintain stability and growth, he advises content creators to keep evolving and secretly experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. He acknowledges that many people are afraid to experiment due to fear of failure, but he has conducted many experiments himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. He stresses the importance of giving 100% effort to any creation, ensuring no future regrets about what could have been done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Fame
Being a famous teenager presents several difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Teenagers naturally engage in "stupid things" and enjoy life, which can be constrained by fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Public scrutiny and the presence of managers can limit spontaneous expressions at events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

Fame has impacted his ability to experience basic life activities. For instance, he doesn't know how to drive because he never had the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. He also missed out on the [[balancing_college_and_youtube | college life]] experience due to his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This break in the "normal cycle" of life—walking, schooling, college, job—leads to a feeling of missing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. He wishes to experience living in a hostel or shared flat to understand college life better, both personally and for content creation relatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

Despite having fulfilled many dreams at a young age, leading to his "dreams ending," he feels satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. He doesn't feel pressure from his large following because he perceives the numbers as abstract rather than a literal crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:51">[0:10:51]</a>. He avoids taking pressure, noting that things go wrong when he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:15">[0:11:15]</a>.

### Parental Views
Ajey's parents are also experiencing his fame as something new for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. They learn to deal with it together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. While they occasionally comment on his use of language, especially abuses, they generally advise against using profanity related to mothers or sisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. He remains conscious of his mother watching during live streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## Personal Life and Philosophy

Ajey Nagar describes himself as a very private and introverted person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. He prefers staying indoors, considering his room his entire world where he works, plays, and chills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. He values his privacy and dislikes "unwanted things" that arise when meeting people, such as fans speaking in his video character's language in front of his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

Despite his fame, he has full independence and freedom, citing the ability to book a flight and travel, for example, to Dubai, whenever he wants, without anyone stopping him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. He identifies as a simple guy who doesn't prefer "rich locations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Ajey's life is blessed with no significant problems, and he is doing exactly what he wants to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

### Advice for Others
Ajey's final advice is to **experience things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:31">[0:11:31]</a>. He urges everyone to get out of their comfort zone and try new things, regardless of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:41">[0:11:41]</a>. Even if an experience goes badly, he believes it will be remembered and laughed about later, often becoming a fun memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:50">[0:11:50]</a>. He suggests that experiencing new things could lead to life-changing discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:13">[0:12:13]</a>.

[[spiritual_growth_and_the_transition_into_a_higher_age | Spiritual growth]] is a profound and often challenging journey, deeply intertwined with the practice of sadhana (spiritual discipline). This path is highly individualistic and demands sustained effort over potentially many lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Spiritual Growth

At its initial stages, [[spiritual_growth_and_the_transition_into_a_higher_age | spiritual growth]] is imperfect, with ego and other factors causing disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The romantic idea of a perfect, easy path is rare in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Even great yogis have experienced difficult personal lives, suggesting that discomfort or pain can be integral to one's spiritual journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

Genuine [[spiritual_growth_and_the_transition_into_a_higher_age | spiritual growth]] is never achieved without hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. If someone achieves significant spiritual progress seemingly suddenly, it is because they have worked for it in past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Initially, a spiritual practitioner's graph of experiences may go up rapidly, then suddenly plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This plateau can last for years or even lifetimes, acting as a test of perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Eventually, nature may decide to release all the accumulated benefits at once, making it appear miraculous to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. There are no "miracles" in this process; it is purely a result of consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Sadhana: Spiritual Discipline

Sadhana, a key aspect of [[personal_development_through_spiritual_discipline_and_selfcare | spiritual discipline and selfcare]], involves practices like meditation, mantra chanting, and rituals, all aimed at connecting to the energy of a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. It's akin to a love affair, where initially, one tries to please someone not actively interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This effort spans lifetimes, influencing natural tendencies and pulling individuals back to the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### The Role of Desires and Motivation
People often have desires beyond just spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The human heart contains all sorts of desires, some of which individuals are not consciously aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. To truly understand a person's motivation, one should observe their actions rather than just listening to their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. For instance, someone might claim to seek spirituality while their energy suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Purpose in Life
Most people, about 99.99%, don't have a pre-defined purpose in life; their lives are reactions to past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. A specific purpose only emerges when an individual has held onto a particular aim for multiple lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This applies to sadhana as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### The Significance of Time and Past Lives
One's current life is not an isolated moment but a continuum of past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. If sufficient spiritual preparation has been done in previous lives, Nirvana or Moksha can be achieved quickly, even in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Conversely, without preparation, it may not be achieved in ten lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This past hard work can manifest as sudden spiritual inclination in the present life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Nature deliberately veils memories of past lives at birth, as remembering them could bias present-life interactions and hinder fair judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Transformations in Spiritual Growth

### Ego and Attachment
The ego, defined as one's sense of "I-ness" or attachment to identity, family, relationships, etc., is fundamental for individual functioning in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Without it, one would be dysfunctional or end up in a mental hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. However, the spiritual goal is to transcend the ego to connect to higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Nirvana, in particular, cannot be attained as long as a normal ego is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

Maya, or attachment, is a fundamental cause of pain in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Anything one is attached to, from relationships to material possessions, is destined to cause pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The spiritual journey begins when one becomes "tired of Maya," or tired of the cyclical nature of pleasure and pain, leading to a visceral cry for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This deep-seated desire for "what is beyond this" signals readiness for divine response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Pain as a Catalyst
Pain is an inevitable part of [[spiritual_growth_and_the_transition_into_a_higher_age | spiritual growth]]; no one truly grows without experiencing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Just as fire tests gold, calamity tests strong individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This process strengthens the mind and body, enabling them to handle the intense energies of higher spiritual ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. It cultivates a necessary degree of detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

For instance, Lord Krishna in the Gita mentions that a yogi who doesn't succeed in one life might be reborn in splendor. This can be a distraction if the deep-seated desire was for material things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. If one misuses this opportunity or indulges in negative actions, they may fall even further in subsequent lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## The Role of Deities and Gurus

Deities are forms of divine energy, not physical beings in the same way humans are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. They can manifest physically but generally prefer not to, as it curtails their powers and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The images we have of deities are inspired by them onto the minds of Rishis and great masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. For average human beings, worshipping devatas (primary deities) is beneficial, as they are deeply connected to the ultimate source and can guide individuals towards higher states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Bhairava Sadhana
Bhairava, a fierce manifestation of Shiva, is a powerful deity whose energy is highly active on Ashtami Tithi (the eighth day of the lunar fortnight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. His worship is particularly potent on Krishna Paksha Ashtami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Bhairava's name can mean "terrifying" but refers to his unconditioned, naked truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

> "Bhairava prepares you for truth, and truth is the only thing that we are scared of." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>

Bhairava makes one fearless by forcing them to confront their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. He acts as a strong guardian for his upasaka (worshipper), pulling them out of negative pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. He dislikes pretense and requires honesty from his devotees, even about their flaws and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

### The Role of Gurus
A [[concept_of_guru_in_spiritual_practices | physical Guru]] is often important in the initial stages of a spiritual journey, as they can respond to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. However, at higher levels, a non-physical entity, like a deity, can also serve as a guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Such divine Gurus do not respond to whims or flattery, and their interactions are very different from human ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Mantras and Their Potency
Mantras are powerful tools for spiritual growth, containing inherent "Shakti" (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Chanting a mantra means serving it, and in turn, it guides the practitioner's path, acting like a guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Bija (seed) mantras are particularly potent, with specific sounds designed to create certain effects. For instance, the "Hreem" Bija mantra is known as the Maya Bija, capable of destroying Maya and giving a vision beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It is associated with Bhuvaneshwari, a Mahavidya who grants material growth and clarity of vision by reducing attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Community and Solitude in the Spiritual Path
While the [[spiritual_growth_and_the_transition_into_a_higher_age | spiritual journey]] is ultimately an individual one, community support is crucial in the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Having a group of friends or a community to discuss experiences and struggles can provide motivation and console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

However, as one reaches very high spiritual states, the path becomes increasingly solitary. Finding a partner of the same spiritual wavelength is very rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. At higher levels of spiritual attainment, interacting with society becomes difficult due to the vast energy gap between the practitioner and ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Such deeply evolved individuals often seek remote, inaccessible places like the Himalayas to continue their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

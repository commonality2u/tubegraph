Historically, the desire for "fair" skin, particularly in regions like Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific, stemmed from the age of imperialism, where European countries promoted the idea of white skin as superior [00:00:16]. This mentality was unfortunately perpetuated through advertising campaigns, which suggested that fairness was necessary for better job prospects or finding love [00:00:41]. However, skin color is genetic and should not be changed; instead, the focus should be on making one's skin the best version of itself [00:01:14].

## Avoiding Skin Whitening Products

It is crucial to avoid chasing skin whitening and using skin whitening creams [00:01:27]. These products contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil the long-term quality of your skin [00:01:32].

### For Dry Skin

If you have dry skin, moisturization is key to achieving a healthy glow [00:01:45]. After washing your face and completely rinsing off all soap, pat your face dry with a towel [00:01:50]. Immediately follow up by applying a mild moisturizer [00:01:54]. A moisturizer will be beneficial for dry skin that flakes off or for very dry lips [00:02:01]. Alternatives like Vaseline (petroleum jelly) can also help achieve glowing, healthy skin over time [00:02:07].

For those with oily skin, a home remedy using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth) can be effective [00:02:15]. Fuller's Earth is readily available at [[indian_skincare_recommendations_and_product_suggestions | Indian grocery stores]] [00:02:22].

#### Home Remedy: Multani Mitti Face Pack
1.  **Preparation**: Buy a block of Fuller's Earth, chip off a piece, and pound it into a powder [00:02:27].
2.  **Mixing**: Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric or haldi into the powder [00:02:32].
3.  **Paste Creation**: Squeeze in a little bit of lemon juice to create a paste [00:02:36]. If the mixture is too dry, add a few drops of water until it reaches a smooth consistency [00:02:39].
4.  **Application**: Apply a thin layer of this mixture onto your face [00:02:45].
5.  **Drying Time**: Let it dry, but do not keep it on your face for longer than 20 minutes [00:02:47].
6.  **Removal**: Wash it off [00:02:51].

This mixture works by:
*   Turmeric: Cleanses the face and acts as an antiseptic [00:02:54].
*   Lemon: Helps increase the glow of your face [00:02:58].
*   Fuller's Earth: Sucks out excess oil from your face, which is especially beneficial for oily skin [00:03:02].

**Frequency**: Do not use this mixture more than once or twice a week (e.g., at a gap of 3 days), as overuse can cause your skin to secrete even more oil as a response [00:03:08]. Consistent use for about a month can show noticeable changes in your face [00:03:18].

## Exfoliation for Glowing Skin

To achieve glowing, "baby-type" skin, exfoliation using a face scrub is recommended [00:03:23]. A face scrub contains small, hard particles [00:03:29].

### [[methods_for_applying_skincare_products_properly | How to Exfoliate]]
When applying a face scrub, massage your face firmly in a circular motion [00:03:33]. Do not press too hard, but apply enough pressure to feel a slight tingling sensation [00:03:38]. This action increases blood circulation to your face, which promotes skin growth [00:03:47].

**Caution**: This method is effective for achieving glowing skin but should *not* be used if you are very acne-prone or currently have acne, as it can harm inflammations on your face [00:04:00].
**Frequency**: Exfoliate no more than once a week, possibly on the same day you use the Multani Mitti pack [00:04:13].

## [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | Diet and Hydration for Clear Skin]]

For clear, glowing skin, focusing on your [[diet_lifestyle_and_stress_management_for_skincare | diet]] is a significant factor [00:04:20].

### Hydration
Throughout the day, keep yourself well-hydrated [00:04:27]. A good indicator of sufficient hydration is if your urine is clear for most of the day; if it's slightly yellow, drink more water [00:04:30].

### Vegetable and Fiber Intake
Prioritize your vegetable and fiber intake [00:04:37]. While fruits can be included, focus primarily on vegetables as they are more nutritionally dense, providing more vitamins and minerals for the same amount of food [00:04:42]. A quick rule of thumb is to consume a variety of colorful vegetables [00:04:52].

## Self-Acceptance and Confidence

Beyond skincare, it is important to remember that attractiveness is also about positivity and confidence [00:08:17]. Love yourself and be comfortable in your own skin, accepting the way you were born [00:08:33]. Do not believe the outdated notion that fair skin is superior to dark skin [00:08:41]. In the present day, all skin types are considered beautiful [00:08:51]. Promoting the idea that dark skin doesn't look good or that one should get rid of a suntan is akin to promoting racism [00:09:02].

Svarish Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes much of his success, including building one of India's biggest wellness startups, to his [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual and yogic lifestyle]] and [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | meditation]] practices, particularly the practice of celibacy for nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His company, which focuses on wellness, has attracted investments from notable figures like Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This article explores how Svarish's adherence to certain principles and practices has profoundly influenced his intuition and life.

## The Journey into Yoga and Spiritual Discipline

Svarish's journey into yoga began at age six, when his parents enrolled him in classes to help him balance and focus better, especially in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Initially, he focused on the physical aspects of yoga, like *Surya Namaskar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. At 17, his perspective shifted when he attended a class taught by a guru who emphasized personal responsibility for enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This encounter led him to deepen his practice with *sadas*, meaning discipline in Sanskrit, which included practices like remaining silent for 40 days and meditating for 9 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He observed that completing these disciplines consistently led to personal advancements in various aspects of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### The Five Precepts
At 18, Svarish's guru gave him five precepts to follow, which he committed to for seven years, though he has continued for nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These precepts are:
1.  **No intoxicants**: This includes no alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No mental and physical stealing**: Aspiring for personal goals is acceptable, but not coveting others' possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
4.  **No lying**: Even white lies are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy (Brahmacharya)**: This is defined as no sex, no fap, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Svarish notes this was the most challenging due to his age and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## [[Spiritual Evolution and Guidance | Impact of Spiritual Lifestyle on Intuition]]

A [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | clean and spiritual lifestyle]], which includes taking care of one's body and mind, can significantly enhance intuition, often referred to as a "Sixth Sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. This involves "knowing things before they happen, knowing a vibe of a person or situation, understanding moments before they happen, and understanding what you should be doing at particular crossroads in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

Svarish acknowledges his intuition is "extremely unreal" and has led to "pretty amazing" incidences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. He recounts how his non-lying precept seemed to influence external events, such as a friend's dress burning, leading her to wear the color he suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Another instance involved predicting a friend's visa approval date and departure date with accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. He also recalls manifesting his desire to work with Christopher Nolan and have high-profile investors like Jennifer Lopez in his company, despite initial skepticism from peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. He states, "I genuinely manifested it. I believed in it and I made it happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

Intuition is believed to be present in everyone but is often blocked by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. In yoga, the "third eye" or Ajna chakra (sixth chakra) is associated with intuition and can be opened through practices like energy pranayam, [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | meditation]], and yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Semen Retention and Enhanced Performance

Semen retention, a key component of Svarish's celibacy practice, is described as taking the body's energy upwards to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This upward movement of energy is believed to open up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process," activating the right brain and enhancing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Svarish notes that this can lead to "Peak Performance level" in various professions, from corporate to creative fields, and even enhance confidence in social situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He challenges listeners to try it for even 21 days to experience the benefits, noting the common post-ejaculation tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Channelling Sexual Energy
Yoga offers specific exercises to control sexual energy and re-channel it into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. A simple technique involves sitting, taking a deep breath, and visualizing the energy from the sexual organs flowing up the spine into the brain, then spreading through the brain upon exhalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This practice helps to manage cravings and transmute lustful feelings into higher forms of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

Svarish admits he still experiences lust, but his practice allows him to be "conscious" of these feelings and "turn that into compassion" and love, which then fades the initial sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This conscious control helps him interact with others, particularly women, in a way that fosters trust and a feeling of safety, rather than physical attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## A Shift in Attraction and Perception

Semen retention is also believed to make an individual more "attractive" or "magnetic," not necessarily physically, but energy-wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Svarish's definition of attraction has changed, moving beyond the physical to a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. He questions why physical attributes define attraction, emphasizing that physical attraction is "very, very superficial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. He suggests that instead of lust, one should feel compassion, love, or empathy for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

While acknowledging sex as a beautiful act that creates life, Svarish emphasizes that its purpose should be pure, especially in the context of creating a child, where the parents' thoughts and feelings are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. He believes that the energy and karma surrounding conception play a role in shaping the child's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## [[Role of Spirituality and Meditation in Daily Life | Meditation Practice]]

Svarish maintains an intensive [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | meditation]] practice today, primarily the *Anapana* of *Vipassana*, which involves focusing on the normal and natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to bring oneself to the present moment by observing thoughts without getting involved in them, allowing them to pass "like leaves in a river" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This practice increases focus levels in waking life, with even 30 seconds of undistracted focus being highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. He asserts that one hour of yoga a day can provide energy for 23 hours and reduce the need for excessive sleep due to enhanced quality of rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings

Svarish shares three core life learnings from his [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | yogic life]] and experiences:
1.  **Be true and authentic to yourself**: It is crucial to remain authentic and not be easily swayed or bombarded by external influences, including environment or peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Taking the first step towards a goal is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Practice self-care (physical and mental)**: Self-care is vital for personal well-being. One must love oneself to be able to care for and love others effectively. He recommends a mix of physical activities like gym or functional training with mindful practices like breathing exercises to foster self-belief and presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. This holistic self-care leads to becoming a better version of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.
3.  **Be a "people person"**: For entrepreneurs and individuals alike, effective people management is critical. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good employer and fostering strong relationships within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Being a people person collectively makes one a more compassionate individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

In essence, Svarish's journey underscores the profound [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life]], demonstrating how disciplined practices can enhance intuition, transform perception, and contribute to [[the_intersection_of_material_success_and_spiritual_wisdom | material success]] and personal well-being.

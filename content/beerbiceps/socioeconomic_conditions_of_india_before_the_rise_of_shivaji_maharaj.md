This article explores the socioeconomic conditions of India prior to the emergence of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's empire, drawing insights from historical research. This period is crucial for understanding the context and the motivations behind [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## India's State Before Shivrai
The first part of the "Shivrai Trilogy" aims to detail the soci-economic conditions and the reality of the average Indian, as well as the kings and emperors ruling the landmass before [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] empire began to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. This historical context is essential to understand [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] mentality, history, and conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:38">[03:48:38]</a>. The expert, Medha Bhaskar, dedicated 20 years to studying [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai]], focusing on what transpired both before and after his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:40">[03:21:40]</a>.

## The Dominance of the Mughal Empire
Before [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai]] was born in the 17th century, the North of India was under the Mughal Empire, which comprised 22 provinces and was considered the biggest empire globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:19">[07:37:19]</a>. The Mughal Empire's peak coincided with [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb's]] ascent to the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

### Administrative Structure: Jagirdars and Mansabdars
The fashion of the time was to outsource the army, meaning it was not directly under the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:04">[07:23:04]</a>.
*   **Jagirdar:** A warrior granted land by the king or sultan. They were in charge of cultivators, collected taxes, and maintained a cavalry force for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:19">[06:52:19]</a>.
*   **Mansabdar:** Similar to a jagirdar, a warrior to whom land was granted. They were responsible for looking after cultivators, collecting taxes (as agriculture was the primary industry), and maintaining cavalry for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:27">[08:00:27]</a>. Approximately 80% of the Mughal Empire's land was granted to mansabdars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:24">[07:51:24]</a>.

### Other Kingdoms and Their Status
South of the Mughal Empire, the Deccan region consisted of sultanates like Nizam Shahi (Maharashtra), Adil Shah (Karnataka), and Qutub Shahi (Hyderabad/Telangana/Andhra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:59">[08:44:59]</a>. Further south, the Vijayanagara Empire of Hindu kings was nearly vanishing by the time [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivrai]] was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:05">[09:06:05]</a>. These Shahi rulers were considered vassals of the Mughal Empire and had to pay tribute to the emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:89:12">[02:89:12]</a>. The Mughals, especially from Akbar's time, desired these southern kingdoms to dissolve into their empire rather than remain vassals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:91:51">[02:91:51]</a>.

### Military Power and Tactics
The Mughal army was extremely powerful, consisting of 200,000 well-mounted, heavy-duty cavalrymen with helmets, full armor, javelins, heavy swords, and shields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:58">[02:52:58]</a>. They also had 40,000 artillerymen trained by the Portuguese, who used lightweight cannons that could be easily moved on horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. The Mughal army was feared due to its immense numbers and highly skilled soldiers from various regions like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and even Russian borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

## Socioeconomic Conditions and Public Mentality
From the 12th to the 17th century, India experienced significant fear and suffering due to continuous invasions and brutal rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.
*   **Fear and Suffering:** The North of India suffered from repeated invasions from the 11th-12th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. The terms "Sultani Calamity" (raiders) and "Asmani Calamity" (natural disaster) were common, highlighting the vulnerability and insecurity of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>.
*   **Brutality and Violence:** Invaders looted temples, killed many people, and took women and children as slaves or "portable property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. There were even instances of torture chambers, where methods like removing skin from feet and harming pregnant women were explicitly documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Self-Esteem:** Over approximately 800 years of invasions, Indians started to view themselves as "secondary citizens" and lost self-esteem, accepting their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.
*   **Discrimination:** Within the Mughal army, Indian Hindus often had darker skin and were paid less than those from Central Asian regions, indicating racial discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>.
*   **Economic Exploitation:** The Mughals extracted immense wealth, approximately 12 million rupees (silver coins, each weighing about 10 grams) per year, from 22 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. This wealth, equivalent to 93,000 kilograms of gold or $3.5 billion today, was accumulated by "sucking the blood and sweat" of cultivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.
*   **Lack of Justice:** With 80% of the Mughal Empire under the rule of military mansabdars, common Indians received little justice. These ruthless warriors maintained cavalry and instilled fear in their respective areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   **Portuguese Influence in Goa:** In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Portuguese in Goa forcibly converted people and brainwashed them to forget their religion, festivals, and lifestyle. Those who refused faced torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

## The Political Climate of Succession
The Mughal Empire was characterized by brutal succession struggles where "it was either the throne or the grave" for contenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.
*   **Cruelty of Rulers:**
    *   Salim (later Jahangir) tortured his own son, Khusrau, by blinding him and putting salt water in his eye sockets for "excruciating pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Khusrau was later killed by Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>.
    *   Shah Jahan himself killed 36 relatives, including Khusrau, to secure his claim to the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:37">[03:15:37]</a>.
    *   [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]], the third son of Shah Jahan, eliminated his brothers through a brutal war of succession. He was strategically sent to challenging provinces like Kabul by Shah Jahan to prevent him from becoming too powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:44">[04:43:44]</a>. He used religion to his advantage, portraying his secular brother Dara Shikoh as an "idolater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:56">[04:51:56]</a>. [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] also deceived his drunken youngest brother, Murad, into believing he would make him emperor to gain his support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:41">[04:52:41]</a>.
*   **Fate of Shah Jahan's Sons:**
    *   Dara Shikoh was ultimately defeated by [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb's]] forces, caught, put on trial under Sharia law, and beheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. His "biggest crime" was writing a book called "Mingling of Two Oceans," which discussed the meeting of two religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
    *   Shah Shuja was driven into Bengal by [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb's]] forces and, according to one strong hypothesis, was killed and eaten by cannibals in Arakan (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma) along with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
    *   Murad was imprisoned by [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] and died from an opium overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
    *   Muhammad Sultan, [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb's]] firstborn son, was also imprisoned for joining Shah Shuja and died of depression at 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

## Historical Research and Perspectives
Medha Bhaskar's research on this period relies on contemporary correspondence and original documents written in Persian, Sanskrit, and Modi script (an old Marathi script) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>. She uses the work of historians who specialized in these languages, such as Sir Jadunath Sarkar (who spent 50 years studying [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Emperor Aurangzeb]]) and Gajanan Mehendale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

### Critique of Historical Narratives
Medha Bhaskar notes that popular depictions of history, such as films like "Jodhaa Akbar" or "Mughal-e-Azam," often "romanticize" or hide the full truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. She argues that these films present a "historical fiction" that viewers might mistakenly believe is real history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:08">[03:04:08]</a>. For example, she states that Akbar was cruel, killing subordinates and women, contrary to popular positive portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. She believes that historians' narratives often "hide the truth" rather than present outright lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. This highlights [[controversial_perspectives_on_indian_history | controversial perspectives on Indian history]].

## Conclusion
The period before [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj]] was marked by pervasive fear, suffering, and brutality under dominant empires, particularly the Mughals, who extracted vast wealth and maintained control through a powerful and often ruthless military structure. The constant internal struggles for power, characterized by extreme violence among Mughal princes, further contributed to the instability. This challenging environment sets the stage for understanding [[the_historical_narrative_of_chhatrapati_shivaji_maharaj | Shivaji Maharaj's]] unique vision to create his own "Swaraj" (self-rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

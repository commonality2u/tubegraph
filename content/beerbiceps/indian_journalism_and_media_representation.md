Palki Sharma is recognized as a leading figure in [[the_role_of_journalism_in_media | journalism]] in India, particularly for her directness and work in international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. She is considered a "face of India" from a [[role_of_media_in_shaping_political_narratives | geopolitical narrative]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Perceptions

One significant challenge for Indian media is its global "press presence index" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. India's presence is not comparable to major global news outlets like Al Jazeera, BBC, RT, CNN, or France 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. While Washington Post and New York Times content is widely consumed, Indian media lacks a similar global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. This is attributed not to a lack of talent or resources, but to a lack of vision in building a credible and impactful global media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### Soft Power and National Image
Media presence is crucial for a country's [[international_perspectives_on_india | soft power]], as it helps shape global perception and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The American media, for instance, has effectively built narratives that portray their military actions as beneficial for the global good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. If a country lacks this media presence, its intentions may be questioned, and its reach limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

There is a concern that some individuals from India "malign" or "diss" India on a global stage, negatively impacting the nation's [[international_perspectives_on_india | soft power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This includes public figures who make "baseless claims" or exaggerate India's problems in international forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It is argued that every Indian abroad serves as the country's "brand ambassador" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.

It is also noted that some Indians still seek validation for their systems from Western powers, believing that Western approval defines what is "right" or a "perfect democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. This is challenged by pointing out double standards, such as protests being handled differently in India (blocking highways for a "righteous cause") versus Canada (police intervention for affecting [[law_and_advocacy_in_india | Law and Order]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Similar inconsistencies are observed in international media coverage of protests in American or European campuses versus those in Delhi or Dhaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

Bollywood is cited as India's [[international_perspectives_on_india | soft power]], portraying India as a "fun loving singing dancing Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. However, the question remains whether this translates into a "favorable outcome" or better perception of India internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. There's a need to constantly build a narrative rooted in truth to shape global opinion and internal self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This includes correcting outdated perceptions, such as India being a land of "snake Charmers" when it is now a land of "coders" with high AI adoption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Role of Social Media and Individuals

Social media plays a massive part in modern media careers, with algorithms determining relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is suggested that individual content creators might become the "New Media companies" because people tend to listen more to human beings due to a trust factor, rather than institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

In an age of "paradox of plenty" with an explosion of content, attention becomes scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. People turn to "cue givers" — editors, influencers, or thought leaders — who have built credibility and can direct attention to what is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

However, the ideal for individuals with vision is to create institutions that "Outlast them" and embody their ethos, ideas, and vision, translated into their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. This is seen as important because media evolves, and a single individual's relevance may not be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

## Gender and News Consumption
A significant issue in news consumption, not limited to India, is that typically around 80% of the news audience is male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This presents a challenge for journalists reporting on women's issues, such as pay parity, abortion, or mental health for new mothers, as these stories often lead to a drop in viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This raises questions about why women might not be as interested in topics like investments, wars, and politics, even though these impact their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. It is important for women to be an active audience to ensure their voices are represented and taken seriously by the news industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

## Media Reporting on Conflicts
Journalists, like soldiers, enter conflict zones when others are leaving, driven by a passion for the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Many Indian reporters often operate with limited resources and support compared to their Western counterparts, sometimes even resorting to hitchhiking to cover events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. Despite these challenges, they deliver coverage, often lacking combat training or appropriate gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

It is highlighted that in the current information age, battlefields are increasingly "in the mind," representing a "battle of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Media narratives significantly shape [[public_perception_and_polarization_in_india | human viewpoints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

Regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, it is acknowledged that both sides have valid perspectives, and the situation is not black and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. The suffering of civilians in Gaza and the political calculations of world powers are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. It is also stressed that eliminating a group like Hamas by brute force is an "unattainable goal," as it may radicalize more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. All people in Palestinian territories should not be punished for the actions of Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

In discussions about [[media_perceptions_and_geopolitical_tensions_between_india_and_china | India-China relations]], it is observed that while India is willing to talk, China's sincerity in negotiations is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. China's internal challenges, such as its debt bubble and anger over property market issues, contrast with its external aggressive stance towards neighbors and other global powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. Despite a large military, China's military is "untested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. China's soft power initiatives, like Confucius Institutes, have largely failed because "No One Believes what they're saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

The discussion also touches on the complex issue of immigration in Europe, noting the economic burden on taxpayers, cultural clashes, and historical accountability of Western nations for issues leading to mass displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.

This article explores a [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] with a strong emphasis on natural and herbal products, applicable for [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | oily skin, dry skin, or even regular skin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The recommendations are presented as honest advice, free from brand sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Following this routine can help prevent issues like acne, blemishes, skin bumps, and irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

A crucial part of any [[indian_skincare_recommendations_and_product_suggestions | Indian skincare routine]] is proper face washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Frequency and Timing
It is recommended to wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up or arriving at your workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you engage in cardio or activities that cause a lot of sweating, a third wash in the middle of the day is acceptable, but ideally, stick to twice daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Product Selection: Herbal vs. Mild Chemical
While mild face washes have been previously recommended due to a lack of herbal options in the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, the ideal choice is a 100% herbal face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Be cautious of big brands claiming to be "ayurvedic" or "herbal" as they often only contain some ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Recommended brands for genuinely natural, ayurvedic, herbal products include:
*   **Khadi**: A budget-friendly option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Kama Ayurveda**: A more expensive brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Forest Essentials**: Another expensive brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
The speaker personally uses a rose water face wash and an ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream from these types of brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Application and Water Temperature
Regardless of the type of face wash, the application [[methods_for_applying_skincare_products_properly | methods for applying skincare products properly]] are consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It is preferred to wash the face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened, allowing for better cleaning and closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

For application:
1.  Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
2.  Rub it between your hands before applying to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
3.  Apply in a circular motion to three main regions for about 15 seconds each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:
    *   Cheeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
    *   Chin and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   T-area (forehead and nose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
Circular motion increases blood flow, rejuvenates skin, promotes skin growth, and cleans dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Be gentle but firm, avoiding rubbing up and down, which can damage skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

After applying a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to nourish the skin, similar to how the body absorbs nutrition from food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. When washing off, use room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature) water, as hot or freezing cold water can damage the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Moisturizers: Natural is Preferred

Natural moisturizers are generally recommended over chemically made ones, which can clog pores, increase acne, and destroy beneficial bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Chemical moisturizers might act as disinfectants, eliminating both good and bad bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Key natural moisturizers:
*   **Rose Water**: A disinfectant that can be applied twice a day (before heading out and at night) using a cotton ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice**: Helps fight acne and fade blemishes or black marks left by acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. It is stronger than rose water and should be applied only once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. If it stings too much, it can be mixed with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera**: Considered a powerful moisturizer, especially for extremely dry skin or bad acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The pulp from an aloe vera plant can be scraped out and applied to the face, often mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This can also cause a slight sting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Always use cotton balls to apply moisturizers to keep the application clean and prevent transferring dirty bacteria from hands to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products: Natural Oils vs. Antibiotics

For active or painful pimples, there are both long-term (moisturizers mentioned above) and short-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Natural Herbal Oils**: These are preferred for initial treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They are low-density skin oils designed to reduce inflammation and help pimples heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   **Sweet Almond Oil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
    *   **Rose Hip Oil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
    *   **Tea Tree Oil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
    Dense oils like coconut oil are not recommended for facial acne as they can clog pores and worsen pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **Antibiotics (e.g., Clinda)**: While effective for active acne, antibiotics should be a secondary option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Overuse can destroy beneficial bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Always try natural oils first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_skin_health | Impact of Diet and Lifestyle on Skin Health]]

Beyond topical applications, [[diet_lifestyle_and_stress_management_for_skincare | diet and lifestyle factors]] significantly impact skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

*   **Dietary Adjustments**:
    *   Eliminate sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Reduce junk food and hotel food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   Avoid packaged fried snacks, which are often full of unhealthy oils and trans fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   Include more vegetables and fruits in your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   Avoid overconsumption of any single food type, including non-vegetarian items, eggs, or vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

*   **Stress Management**:
    *   High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin, aging, and skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It can also increase oil secretion from sebaceous glands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
    *   Reduce cortisol through good sleep hygiene (quality sleep) and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. These practices can significantly lower stress and improve skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The overarching philosophy is to "turn towards nature, turn away from chemicals" for optimal skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This routine applies to both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

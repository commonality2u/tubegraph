The Chanchlani family exemplifies how strong family values contribute significantly to the upbringing and success of children. Ashish Chanchlani and Muskan Chanchlani's parents are credited with instilling correct values, which have helped their children become leaders in their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Core Values Instilled

From a young age, the Chanchlani children were taught that success is more important than money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Their parents emphasize the importance of humility and staying grounded, even after achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Humility and Equality
Both Ashish and Muskan are described as very humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They treat everyone equally, from their cook to their watchman, speaking to them with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This acceptance and equal treatment of all people is a key lesson learned from their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The family believes that true success lies in adhering to humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Positivity and Support
The children were raised without jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Ashish, for instance, expresses positive feelings and appreciation for the hard work of other creators like Amit Bhadana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Their mother is also described as being very positive and optimistic, always believing that something good comes out of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Parental Influence on Career and Work Ethic

The parents played a significant role in shaping their children's work ethic and career paths, offering both guidance and freedom.

### Early Exposure to Work
Ashish's father, who is from the business world, ensured his son was not sheltered like many "rich kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Ashish was working with his father from the age of 16-17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He regularly worked at their multiplexes, handled banking, and was instrumental in bringing high technology like 3D and Dolby sound systems to the cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This hands-on experience instilled a strong work ethic and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Support for Unconventional Paths
When Ashish wanted to pursue acting and start his vine channel, his parents provided significant [[career_choices_and_parental_support | parental support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. His mother initially had doubts but eventually reviewed his videos and was happy to see him pursuing his passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. His father encouraged him to pursue acting while still finishing his engineering studies, emphasizing the importance of education alongside passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This highlights their progressive [[parental_perspectives_on_pursuing_unconventional_careers | parental perspectives on pursuing unconventional careers]].

### The Drive for Success
The family instilled a hunger for success that leads to humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The father recounts how Ashish, despite being the son of a wealthy man, wanted to make his own identity and stand on his own feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This drive for self-reliance and creating one's own identity was a key lesson learned from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Parents

The children reflect on the crucial lessons learned from their parents:

*   **Humility and Bonding (Mother)**: Ashish learned humility and the importance of bonding with everyone from his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Independence and Identity (Father)**: From his father, Ashish learned business skills and the importance of creating his own identity, rather than flaunting family wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This also speaks to navigating the [[challenges_and_pressures_of_living_up_to_family_expectations | challenges and pressures of living up to family expectations]] associated with a prominent family legacy.
*   **Optimism and Perseverance (Both Parents)**: Muskan highlights her mother's positivity and her father's lesson to "never give up" and to always treat everyone with respect, regardless of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Parental Advice for Life

The parents offer profound advice for their children and other parents:

*   **Health and Discipline**: The most crucial advice given to Ashish and Muskan is to love what they do, take care of their health, and live a disciplined life, as it helps in all ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_fitness_and_family_time | importance of fitness and family time]].
*   **Allowing Children to Fly**: For other mothers, the advice is to let children pursue what they want, give them a chance for at least a year, and if they succeed, let them continue. They should not be restricted or tied down, but allowed to "fly like a bird" and find their own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This embodies [[the_importance_of_learning_through_experience | the importance of learning through experience]].
*   **Avoiding Confusion**: Restricting children too much can lead to confusion about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The parents believe in fostering independence and clarity of purpose.

In conclusion, the Chanchlani family demonstrates that instilling values such as humility, hard work, independence, respect for all, and supporting children's passions are fundamental for their personal and professional development.

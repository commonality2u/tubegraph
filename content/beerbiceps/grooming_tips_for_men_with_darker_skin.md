The desire for fairer skin, particularly in regions like Asia-Pacific, Africa, and South America, is deeply rooted in the historical impact of imperialism. During the imperialistic age, European countries influenced the belief that white skin was superior, a notion that has persisted through generations, perpetuated by advertisements promoting fairness as a path to success or love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand that skin color is genetic and should not be changed, but rather optimized to be its best version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

True attractiveness comes from positivity and confidence, self-love, and comfort in one's own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. All skin types are considered beautiful today, and believing otherwise promotes racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

This guide provides [[basic_male_grooming_tips_for_indian_men | grooming tips]] and [[fashion_tips_for_men_with_darker_skin | fashion advice]] specifically tailored for men with darker or Indian skin tones.

## Skincare for a Natural Glow

### 1. Do Not Chase Skin Whitening

Avoid skin whitening creams as they are detrimental to your skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These products often contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### 2. Tailored Skincare for Your Skin Type

To achieve a healthy glow, adapt your routine based on your skin type:

*   **For Dry Skin:**
    After washing your face and completely rinsing off soap, dry it with a towel and then apply a mild moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A moisturizer is highly beneficial for dry skin that tends to flake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For dry lips, Vaseline (petroleum jelly) can also be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These practices contribute to healthy, glowing skin over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **For Oily Skin (Multani Mitti Home Remedy):**
    Multani Mitti, also known as Fuller's Earth, can be found at any Indian grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   **Preparation:** Chip off a block of Fuller's Earth and pound it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric (haldi) into it, squeeze in a bit of lemon, and add a few drops of water if needed to create a smooth paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Application:** Apply a thin layer of this mixture to your face and let it dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   **Important:** Do not leave it on for more than 20 minutes before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Turmeric cleanses the face as an antiseptic, lemon enhances glow, and Fuller's Earth absorbs excess oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   **Frequency:** Use this mixture no more than once or twice a week, ideally with a 3-day gap, to avoid stimulating more oil secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Noticeable changes can be seen within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### 3. Exfoliation

To achieve glowing, baby-soft skin, use a face scrub, which is a face wash containing small, hard particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Method:** When applying, massage your face firmly in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Press hard enough to feel a slight tingling sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** The particles increase blood circulation to the face, promoting new skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Caution:** Do not use this method if you are acne-prone or currently have acne, as it can harm inflammations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Exfoliate no more than once a week, perhaps on the same day as your Multani Mitti application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### 4. Diet for Clear Glowing Skin

Your diet significantly impacts skin clarity and glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Hydration:** Stay hydrated throughout the day, aiming for clear urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Prioritize vegetables, which are more nutritionally dense than fruits, providing more vitamins and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Incorporate a variety of colors in your vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Grooming for Neatness

### 5. Neatness and Beard Maintenance

Focus on looking neat and handsome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Beard:** If you choose to keep a beard, ensure it is well-maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Use [[facial_hair_grooming_techniques | beard grooming products]] or trim it to keep it neat, avoiding a bushy appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Patchy Beard:** If your beard grows in patchy spots, it's generally best to avoid growing it out, as it can make you look scruffy and unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In such cases, either go completely clean-shaven or grow a full beard and meticulously care for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Virat Kohli's beard is an example of a well-maintained, enhancing beard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Fashion Tips for Darker Skin Tones

### 6. The Primacy of Physique

Your physique is almost 90% of the game when it comes to pulling off any clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Healthy Build:** You don't need to be a bodybuilder, but aim to look healthy with filled-out arms and chest, and worked legs and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This can be achieved through basic workouts, even home workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Golden Rule:** If you have a good physique with the basics covered, you can wear absolutely any color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### 7. Colors to Avoid if Not Fit

If you are very skinny or slightly heavier, be mindful of bright colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Why Avoid:** Bright colors like white, red, orange, or bright blue draw attention to your physique and highlight the contrast between your skin tone and the clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### 8. Recommended Colors

Prioritize darker colors for your t-shirts and shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Black, navy blue, brown, olive green, dark gray, and dark maroon pair very well with a slightly dark, wheatish Indian skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Emphasis:** While color choice is important, it is not as critical as maintaining a good physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

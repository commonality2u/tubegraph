Sudha Murthy's engagement with films spans decades, starting from her childhood, and has evolved from pure enjoyment to a more analytical perspective, influencing her views on society, life, and even her writing.

### Early Enjoyment and Cultural Exposure
From a young age, [[Sudha Murthys perspective on the meaning of life | Sudha Murthy]] found joy in movies, initially appreciating them for their storyline, songs, tunes, and acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. She recalls seeing films like *Madhumati* in 1958 when she was eight years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Movies also served as a window to the world, allowing her to "see Paris and London" in films like *Sangam* during a time when international travel was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Films as More Than Entertainment
As she matured, [[Sudha Murthys perspective on the meaning of life | Sudha Murthy]] began to view movies more analytically, considering them much more than just three hours of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. She strongly believes that films carry a significant influence, particularly on teenagers in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This perspective underpins her conviction that movies *must* convey a positive message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. She argues that showing "something wrong on the screen," even for fun or creativity, can lead many people to adopt "bad habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. She asserts that the content of a movie should be beneficial to society, rather than solely focused on entertainment or making money if it negatively impacts people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This highlights her strong belief in the [[Influence of films and media on paranormal beliefs | social responsibility of media and content creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Influential and "Character-Building" Films
When asked about character-building movies, [[Sudha Murthys perspective on the meaning of life | Sudha Murthy]] struggled to limit her list, citing numerous films that left a significant impression on her throughout her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Her extensive list includes:
*   *Madhumati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   *Mughal-e-Azam* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   *Aradhana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   *Mother India* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   *Hono* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
*   *Naya Daur* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
*   *Ganga Jamuna* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   *Sadhana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
*   *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   *Raazi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   *Border* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> (noted as "very good" and "very inspiring," reflecting the [[Impact of militarythemed films like Border on Indian society | impact of military-themed films]])
*   *Veer-Zaara* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>

While she mentions many romantic films, she clarifies that her appreciation goes beyond mere romance. She looks for deeper themes, such as the "struggle of a mother" or a "wife" as seen in *Aradhana*, rather than just a romance ending in marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Life Lessons from Cinematic Narratives
[[Sudha Murthys perspective on the meaning of life | Sudha Murthy]] uses the contrast between romantic films and "real life" to convey a significant life lesson: "life is bigger than romance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. She explains that while romance is present in youth, true life involves facing challenges like disease, old age, and unfulfilled desires, requiring struggle and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The ability to accept failures, forgive, forget, and "move on" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of accepting a partner's "package" of positives and negatives in marriage, learning to adjust rather than expecting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This perspective aligns with her broader philosophy on [[Sudha Murthys advice for contentment and personal wellbeing | contentment]] and acceptance in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Influence on Work and Outlook
Her positive outlook, potentially reinforced by her choice of media consumption, is also evident in her own literary work. She mentions consciously embedding a "certain underlying sense of upliftment or positivity" in her books, much like the energy she tries to put into her creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Her children's books, such as *Grandparents' Bags of Stories*, aim to teach positive meanings and life lessons, encouraging reading habits and providing useful guidance for a "better quality of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. She believes children's books and movies lay the foundation for a child's ethics and morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

She differentiates her approach from those who criticize her for being "too positive," asserting that her positivity is genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. She does not aim to "teach" directly but rather writes what she feels, which naturally results in positive and impactful stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### Views on Modern Media and Generations
[[Sudha Murthys perspective on the meaning of life | Sudha Murthy]] notes that today's younger generations, particularly those influenced by social media and the rapid pace of life, think differently due to the abundance of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. She links the "mental health issues generation" to their upbringing with more luxury and comfort, leading to increased expectations and a diminished appreciation for smaller joys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This contrasts with her own generation, which was "used to rejection" and shared resources, leading to greater resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. Her observations on generational differences are a key component of her [[Sudha Murthys views on child upbringing and generational differences | views on child upbringing and societal changes]].

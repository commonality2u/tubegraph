Kareena Kapoor Khan views her career with immense gratitude, stating that she has been "very, very lucky" to have always loved her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. She considers acting an "intoxication" that brings her "so much happiness and so much joy" every time she is in front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This passion for her craft has been a driving force throughout her extensive career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Her Approach

Kareena Kapoor Khan's approach to acting has evolved significantly over her 25-year career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

### Early Career: Hunger for Success
In her 20s, she was driven by a "fire," "lust," and "hunger" to be the best, constantly seeking to do more films and achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This period was characterized by an unwavering ambition to climb to the top, a mindset instilled by her mother who encouraged her to "aim for the stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Later Career: Seeking Peace and Depth
After 25 years in the industry, her hunger has shifted towards seeking "a little bit of peace" and a "deeper understanding" in the characters she portrays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. [[kareena_kapoor_khan_and_motherhood | Motherhood]] and becoming a wife have brought different responsibilities and expanded her perspective beyond solely chasing box office hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. She no longer believes that success is everything, but rather aims to prove herself as a good actor and star, with her mind "also expand[ing]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Her husband and children have played a crucial role in her growth as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Character Development and Performance

Kareena Kapoor Khan emphasizes that the best acting comes from a "deeper place" and a desire to give one's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. While she makes many things look easy, she invests deeply in her roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Films like *Laal Singh Chaddha* (where she played the "deep character" Rupa), *Heroine*, and *Tashan* are examples of roles she loved and gave a lot to, even if they weren't box office successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. She finds [[navigating_fame_and_public_perceptions_in_bollywood | playing "grey" characters]] most interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

She aims to change and evolve with every film, not just in her look or size, but in her character and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. An example of her commitment to a role was her "size zero" transformation for an action film, which took a year and a half to achieve as a personal challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.

## Influence of Personal Traits

### Confidence
[[the_impact_of_confidence_on_kareena_kapoor_khans_career | Confidence]] is highlighted as her "biggest asset" and "biggest ammunition" in the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. She believes confidence cannot be faked, and she has never remembered being without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This internal [[the_impact_of_confidence_on_kareena_kapoor_khans_career | confidence]] is evident in her performances, such as her iconic character 'Geet' from *Jab We Met*, who inspired many due to her lovable nature combined with confidence and innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

### Authenticity and Empathy
Kareena Kapoor Khan states she can only act when playing characters, as her emotions are transparent in real life, showing on her face and in her eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. She describes herself as a "reactive person" and feels this helps her acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

She believes that empathy is crucial in performances, allowing an actor to understand and convey the emotions of other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>. She notes that she can "read other people easily," which can be tiring but aids her craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Motivation

Despite 25 years in the industry, she still possesses a "hunger for more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>. This constant desire to strive for perfection and challenge herself keeps her motivated, driving her to continually ask "what can I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. This drive is primarily for herself, for her own satisfaction and happiness, rather than to prove anything to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## Handling Challenges

Kareena Kapoor Khan acknowledges that her career has seen "too many ups and downs" and a "string of failures" that most people wouldn't survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. She has internalized the pain of these failures, sometimes crying herself to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. However, she believes that "failure is more important than success," as it pushes her to improve and strive for better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This resilience allows her to see herself "beyond failure and success," focusing instead on the craft and giving her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.

She also touches upon the demanding nature of being an actor, where one must maintain a "perfect star" image in public, regardless of personal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This requires suppressing emotions and maintaining composure, highlighting the "selfish" yet necessary aspect of the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

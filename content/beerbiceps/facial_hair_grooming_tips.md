Looking handsome, clean, and tidy is emphasized over relying solely on natural looks, particularly for Indian men dealing with issues like acne, oily skin, and high humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. For women, cleanliness is associated with looking good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.

## Managing Facial Hair

There are three primary approaches to managing facial hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>:
1.  **Grow out your beard entirely**: If opting for this, ensure proper beard grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
2.  **Stylize your beard**: Consider a goatee or a soul patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.
3.  **Go clean-shaven**: This is considered the "golden way" or "Evergreen way" for a clean and tidy appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid growing a mustache, especially if you are a young guy, as it can make you look like a "child molester" and is considered "very historic" rather than contemporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>.

### Shaving Tips

For a clean-shaven look, a good quality razor is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. The Gillette Mark II Turbo razor is recommended for three reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>:
*   **Strong and durable blades**: This means less frequent replacement, saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   **Excellent grip**: A quality grip helps prevent cuts, especially when shaving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.
*   **Spring-mounted blades**: This feature allows for precision shaving, useful for stylizing or avoiding pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:27">[03:27:27]</a>.

## Secondary Facial Hair

Beyond primary beard and mustache areas, secondary facial hair also requires attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>:

*   **Ear Hair**: If hair grows out of the ears, it can be shaved off using a regular razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:03">[04:03:03]</a>.
*   **Nose Hair**: Use a super narrow, super sharp pair of small scissors to trim nose hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11">[04:11:11]</a>.
*   **Unibrow**: A unibrow can negatively impact one's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:43">[04:43:43]</a>.
    *   **Tweezing**: Every guy should own a pair of tweezers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:25">[04:25:25]</a>. A good quality pair, costing around 100-200 rupees, should have perfectly matching ends when joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:51">[04:51:51]</a>.
    *   **Technique**: Pluck only the super thick hairs between the eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>. Avoid entirely clean shaving the area, especially if you have a thick unibrow, as it can look unnatural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:09">[05:09:09]</a>. Leave a few strands of hair to maintain a natural appearance, ensuring the face looks like it has two eyebrows, not one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:18">[05:18:18]</a>.

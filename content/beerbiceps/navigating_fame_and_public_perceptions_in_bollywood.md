The Indian film industry is undergoing rapid changes in how films are made, financed, and received by audiences, particularly in the post-pandemic era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This shift presents unique [[challenges_and_struggles_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges]] for upcoming stars and artists who often struggle to express themselves authentically on public forums, as they are frequently asked the same questions in repetitive interview formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Podcasts, however, offer a platform for deeper, more personal conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Janhvi Kapoor: Beyond the Public Persona

Janhvi Kapoor, an emerging Bollywood star, has opened up on a podcast about her experiences, offering insights into her life and career. She notes that her "true vibe" is often not known until people meet her in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. She feels she has more depth than initially perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> and is genuinely interested in the world outside her own media bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Kapoor describes herself as a curious person who loves reading, traveling, and interacting with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. She sees humans as "walking talking Encyclopedias of their own experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> and enjoys listening to people discuss their passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. She identifies as an empath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, finding enjoyment in observing people's eyes light up when they speak about something they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Navigating Public Perception and Nepotism

Kapoor acknowledges the societal perception of her as "Janhvi Kapoor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, but also sees herself as "slightly under-confident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This under-confidence stems from early experiences with the "nepotism debate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Since childhood, she has faced remarks implying her successes (like good test scores or friendships) were due to her parents' fame, which made her "question what you have to offer in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

She admits there is some truth to the idea that people treat her differently because of her background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. However, she prefers to be under-confident rather than "delusional" or "arrogant" about the attention she receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. She believes arrogance leads to complacency in art and stagnation in personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Authenticity in a Commercialized World

Kapoor resists thinking of herself as a "brand," which she has been told is a shortcoming in her profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. She finds it challenging when audiences expect a simple, identifiable image from her, asking if she's the girl who wears saris to temples, skimpy gym clothes, says inappropriate things, or dislocates her shoulders for a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Her response is clear: "I'm all of these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

She is increasingly "giving less and less of a damn about what I'm putting out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, feeling it is "throwing people off a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This shift towards authenticity, she notes, gained momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic, which "sped up this process of like realigning your priorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. She desires to discover who she is for herself, rather than for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. She believes art helps with self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Family Influence and Artistic Lineage

Kapoor comes from an artistic family, attributing her internal drive for cinema and art partially to genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. She jokingly attributes this to "mitochondria" from her maternal lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Father's Influence
She describes her father as a "hustler" who is incredibly strong and resilient, "nothing gets him down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Her father and uncles are "huge believers in hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a> and approach everything with "purity of intent," being more process-driven than outcome-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>. He values honesty in work and dealings with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. Growing up as the "less affluent Kapoors" in Chembur made him feel the need to hustle more and value what he had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. The Kapoor brothers are "real with each other" and "show up for each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

### Mother's Influence
Kapoor acknowledges that her mother's influence is evident in many aspects of her life, including the way she walks, eats, her voice, her crying, and her sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Her eyes are said to have the same "endearing energy" as her mother's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. She feels that people do not truly know her mother, Sridevi Kapoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. What she wants the world to know about her mother is that she stood for "dignity and innocence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Despite years in the industry, her mother remained "a child," "naive at the ways of the world and innocent and sheltered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. This innocence made her art and her person "uncorrupted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

Growing up, Kapoor's education came primarily from being on her father's film sets or traveling with her mother, rather than formal schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This experience taught her invaluable lessons about "respecting people's time," "different cultures," and the "emotional intelligence that comes with understanding the sensitivity of an artist in artistic environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. After losing her mother, the family's love for films and cinema has been a driving force, almost "keeping me alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Personal Life and Loneliness

Kapoor is currently single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a> and, while happy, admits to feeling lonely at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. She observes that "intimacy has become so accessible" in their generation that it makes people "too scared to commit" to real equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Her loneliness is a "consequence of my past experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>, and she is now "guarding her energy" to protect her artistic growth, having "wasted too much of my energy on people that didn't deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

## Future Aspirations and Film

Kapoor expresses a desire for more films, more experiences, more growth, and more love from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. She hopes to do "dark, twisted" roles in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

Her latest film, "Good Luck Jerry," streaming on Disney+ Hotstar, is about a girl who appears innocent but has a dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. The film explores how she realizes she doesn't need to be apologetic or hide behind a facade of innocence, embracing that she is "so much more than that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization and its archaeological significance | Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, is predominantly located in Pakistan, with a significant portion also found in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Unfortunately, most of the sites within India remain undiscovered and underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The IVC is recognized as the first civilization of India to have had direct contact with the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization and its archaeological significance | Indus Valley Civilization]] was contemporary with Mesopotamia, and evidence suggests they engaged in trade, as indicated by the presence of Mesopotamian seals in India and IVC seals in Mesopotamia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:28">[08:43:28]</a>. A major challenge in understanding this civilization is the inability to read the Harappan script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:49">[02:10:49]</a>.

## Key Archaeological Sites

Several important sites offer insights into the IVC:

*   **Rakhigarhi**
    *   Located in Hissar, Haryana, Rakhigarhi is an active excavation site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>. The village is built on a mount, beneath which the ancient city lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Lothal**
    *   Identified as a port city in Gujarat, Lothal played a crucial role in receiving people from Mesopotamia and Central Asia, highlighting [[crosscultural_connections_between_ancient_civilizations | transcontinental human interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Dholavira**
    *   Situated on the India-Pakistan border in the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, Dholavira represents a remarkable feat of [[ancient_indian_temples_and_technology | human ingenuity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Despite being in a salt desert, inhabitants of Dholavira, around 2000-1500 BCE, built a citadel and an entire civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. They developed techniques to filter salty water and grow food, baffling modern archaeologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Archaeological Exploration and Challenges

Only about 10% of global archaeology has been discovered, meaning the true extent of [[human_migration_and_ancient_civilizations | human history]] is largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. India is considered a primary site for ancient discoveries due to its long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The climate of India, being tropical and subtropical, allowed for long-term settlement without constant migration, unlike other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

The **Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)**, founded by the British officer and treasure hunter Alexander Cunningham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, is the main archaeological institution in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Its mandate includes exploration, excavation, and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[preservation_and_exploration_of_archaeological_sites_in_india | Preservation and Exploration of Archaeological Sites in India]]
> The illegal trafficking of antiquities is a major global issue, on par with drug and ammunition trade, making countries like India, Egypt, and Italy significant victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>. Many [[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | Indian artifacts]] are currently housed in institutions like the British Museum, which are full of Indian "loot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

One innovative approach to archaeological exploration is satellite remote sensing, or space archaeology. This technique allows archaeologists to identify potential sites by analyzing satellite imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This method helps in the exploration of underwater heritage, which is a priority for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

The true history of human civilization is far older than what is often taught in textbooks, which simplify information for younger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The speaker stresses that only about 10% of the evidence needed to understand human origins has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Therefore, current understandings of [[human_migration_and_ancient_civilizations | human migration]] and [[historical_dating_of_ancient_indian_texts | early civilization]] are based on limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Geopolitics and Historical Revelation
> Geopolitics plays a role in what historical findings are revealed or hidden, potentially influencing how humans perceive themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. Historical research is still dictated by powerful individuals and nations, limiting public access to certain information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

> In India, funding for archaeology is significantly lacking, and there is a disconnect between talking about Indian culture and actively investing in its [[preservation_and_exploration_of_archaeological_sites_in_india | preservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Philanthropic grants, rather than return-on-investment models, are needed to support existing institutions like the ASI in their mission of exploration, excavation, and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Svarish Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success to his practice of [[celibacy_and_its_effects_on_personal_and_professional_life | celibacy]], specifically following a "no sex and no fap" rule for nine years [00:00:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He believes this practice has granted him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams [00:00:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores his journey, the principles he follows, and the profound benefits he has experienced.

## Svarish Shashi's Yogic Journey and Five Precepts

Svarish Shashi's journey began with yoga classes at age six, introduced by his parents to help him balance and focus for cricket [00:03:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His life took a significant turn at 17 when he attended a yoga class his father had paid for [00:04:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. He met a teacher who, rather than claiming to enlighten him, impressed him with honesty [00:04:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This led him to continue classes and engage in 'sadas' â€“ periods of intense discipline [00:05:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Examples include 40 days of silence and meditating nine hours a day [00:05:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. He found that completing these 'sadas' consistently led to personal advancements, such as becoming the captain of his college cricket team [00:06:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

His teacher then introduced five precepts, which Svarish committed to:
1.  **No intoxication:** This includes no alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food [00:07:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-violence (Ahimsa):** Practicing non-violence through actions, thoughts, and words. He claims he doesn't remember the last time he even killed a mosquito [00:07:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No stealing:** This encompasses both physical stealing and "mental stealing," such as coveting others' possessions [00:07:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **No lying (Satya):** Even white lies are avoided. If late, he states the true reason [00:07:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **[[celibacy_and_its_effects_on_personal_and_professional_life | Celibacy]] (Brahmacharya):** Defined as no sex, no getting physical, no fap, and no ejaculation at all [00:08:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Initially, he followed these to prove his teacher wrong, but after about 1.5 years (around age 19.5), it became a natural way of life for him [00:09:32]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. At 27, he has not broken any of these precepts [00:09:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. He believes his current success, including his wellness startup SVA (with investors like Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez), is built on trust, love, respect, ethics, and values [00:01:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> [00:11:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## [[intermittent_fasting_benefits | Benefits of NoFap]] and Semen Retention

The benefits Svarish Shashi discusses are a result of adhering to all five precepts, not just semen retention [00:11:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. He highlights several key advantages:

*   **Increased Stamina and Energy:** He reports higher stamina and a feeling of being more energetic [00:11:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Creative Thought and Focus:** Semen retention involves directing energy upwards to the brain, which he says "opens up a completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" [00:11:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This translates to improved [[improving_focus_for_success | focus levels]] and peak performance in professional and personal life [00:12:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> [00:13:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Increased Attractiveness and Magnetic Presence:** Svarish has been told that semen retention makes a person more attractive, perhaps due to an energetic shift rather than physical changes [00:20:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. He notes that women feel safe around him, attributing it to his internal energy and lack of physical desire for them [00:28:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Shift in Definition of Attraction:** Prolonged semen retention changes the perception of attraction from superficial physical attributes to a deeper understanding, such as seeing others as family [00:21:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. This encourages a shift from lust to compassion and love [00:28:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Unreal Life Experiences (Manifestation/Intuition):** Adherence to the precepts, particularly non-lying, has led to seemingly miraculous instances where his words manifested into reality, like a friend's visa arriving on the exact date he predicted [00:32:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. He believes these are not coincidences but manifestations of his beliefs and a result of the nature's response to his discipline [00:32:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a> [00:38:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. This aligns with the concept of the third eye (Ajna Chakra) in yoga, which is associated with [[Tantra and its Practices | intuition]] and can be activated through various practices like meditation and pranayama [00:38:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in NoFap

The initial period of NoFap can be difficult, as the body and mind are tested [00:16:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Svarish admits to still feeling horny and lustful at times, as he is not "enlightened" [00:27:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. However, the key is conscious control and rechanneling that energy.

### Yogic Practice to Control Sexual Energy

A simple yoga exercise derived from the world of yoga, including Osho's teachings, can help:
1.  When feeling lustful, sit in one place [00:15:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  Take a deep breath in, visualizing the energy flowing upwards from the sex organs, through the spine, into the brain [00:15:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
3.  Breathe out, imagining that energy spreading through the brain [00:15:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

This practice, taught in advanced meditation schools like Osho school, Isha Foundation, YSS, or Chinmaya Mission, helps rechannel sexual energy into creative energy [00:16:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> [00:16:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. The physical exercises, asanas, and breathing practices taught by Svarish's teacher also helped channelize this energy [00:18:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Meditation for Focus

Svarish practices Anapana of Vipassana, which involves focusing on the normal and natural breath [00:39:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to be an observer of thoughts as they come and go, not to get involved [00:40:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This practice increases [[improving_focus_for_success | focus levels]] in daily life [00:40:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>, with even 30 seconds of undistracted focus leading to significant internal shifts [00:40:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. He believes that one hour of yoga a day can provide energy for the remaining 23 hours, reducing the need for excessive sleep to 4-6 hours [00:40:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Life Learnings from a Yogic Path

Svarish Shashi shares three key life learnings:
1.  **Be true and authentic to yourself:** Don't let external environment or peer pressure push you away from your true path [00:41:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The first step is crucial for any race [00:41:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Self-care (physical and mental) is essential:** One must take care of themselves and love themselves first to be able to care for or love others [00:41:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This includes physical [[benefits_of_conditioning | conditioning]] like gym and yoga, as well as mindful practices [00:42:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a people person:** People management is critical for leadership and success. Employees often leave employers, not companies, emphasizing the importance of being a good leader and fostering positive relationships [00:43:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

These principles collectively lead to becoming a more compassionate person, inspiring others, and spreading a positive message, just as Svarish's own transformation led him to establish his yoga company [00:44:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. He concludes with the philosophy: "Love like there is no tomorrow and if Tomorrow Comes Love Again" [00:44:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

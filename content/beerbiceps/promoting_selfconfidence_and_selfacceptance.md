True attractiveness stems from positivity and [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | confidence]], not just external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Before focusing on grooming or fashion, it is crucial to cultivate self-love and learn to be comfortable in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Historical Context of Skin Color Bias
The perception that fair skin is superior to dark skin originated during the imperialistic age, when European countries conquered regions like Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This era led to the belief that white skin was better, a thought process that unfortunately persists in many Asian, African, and South American countries today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

This bias was further perpetuated through media, such as "Fair and Lovely" ads, which historically promoted the idea that fair skin was necessary for career success or finding love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Both individuals and their parents have been influenced by these imperialistic ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Embracing Your Natural Skin Tone
The truth about skin color lies in genetics; it is something you should not try to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Instead of chasing fairness, focus on making your natural skin the best version of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Dangers of Skin Whitening
Avoid using skin whitening creams, as they can harm your face in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These products often contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil the quality of your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Modern Perspective on Beauty
In contemporary society, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It is important to reject any notion that dark skin is unattractive or that you should try to alter your natural complexion, such as getting rid of a suntan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Promoting such ideas can be seen as promoting racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

[[developing_a_positive_mindset | Developing a positive mindset]] involves understanding that focusing too much on skin color distracts from other aspects that truly enhance appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. By accepting and appreciating your unique characteristics, you can foster [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | personal growth and self-discovery]] and cultivate genuine [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | self-confidence and happiness]].

Parental influence and support play a crucial role in shaping a child's career path, especially when venturing into unconventional fields. The Chanchlani family exemplifies this, with parents providing both foundational values and practical support for their children's chosen careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Core Family Values

The parents of Ashish and Muskan Chanchlani emphasize that their children's greatest strength is their humility and kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They treat everyone with respect, from their cook to their watchman, speaking to them with love and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This grounded approach to life ensures that despite their success, they remain "down to earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

A key value instilled from childhood is that [[importance_of_family_values_in_personal_and_professional_life | success is more important than money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This focus on achievement over wealth fosters a "hunger for success" that keeps them humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Fostering Independence and Hard Work

Unlike many "rich kids" who are often sheltered and have everything made easy for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, Ashish was encouraged to work from a young age. He started working with his father in their multiplex business from the age of 16-17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

His duties included:
*   Regularly working in the multiplexes alongside his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Suggesting high technology implementations like 3D and 7.1 Dolby sound for the multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Championing Hollywood movies and their market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Handling daily banking tasks like depositing cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This [[early_struggles_in_career | early exposure to work]] and responsibility was a "big part of his personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, teaching him the value of being self-made and independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Ashish learned from his father's example of not relying on inherited wealth but striving to become a "man on his own feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Supporting Unconventional Career Paths

When Ashish decided to pursue an acting career and start his vine channel, his parents provided significant support:
*   **Initial Review and Acceptance**: His mother initially questioned his videos ("what is he doing?"), but once she saw them and others' reactions, she became very happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Provision of Needs**: She consistently provided whatever he needed for his work at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Trust and Understanding**: Despite her concerns about the volume of content or certain themes, she trusted him to manage his work, saying, "Ashu, I am also an adult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Passion-Driven Approach**: His parents understood that he started his vine channel as a passion project, not primarily for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, and that this passion was a key to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Guidance on Education vs. Passion

When Ashish expressed difficulty with engineering and a desire to be an actor, his father advised him to pursue both side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. He emphasized the importance of finishing his studies and not quitting midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This highlights a balanced view that while passion is important, [[the_impact_of_grades_on_life_and_career | education provides a crucial foundation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Navigating Fame and Humility

The parents actively guide their children on handling fame and money:
*   **Humility Amidst Success**: They stress that true success is maintaining humility despite achieving fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Lessons from Film Stars**: Ashish's father shared experiences of meeting film stars, explaining that their fame is transient and tied to film success, instilling the lesson that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Advice for Parents of Children in Unconventional Careers

For mothers who are nervous about their children's unconventional careers, Ashish's mother offers valuable advice on [[dealing_with_parental_expectations_and_support_in_unconventional_careers | parental expectations and support in unconventional careers]]:
*   **Allow Exploration**: Let the child pursue what they want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Give Time**: Give them at least one year to see if they can succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Don't Restrict**: Do not stop or restrict them; allow them to "fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, as children are like birds who eventually want to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Confusion**: Over-restriction can lead to confusion in life about future paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

This approach allows children to develop self-reliance and clarity in their career trajectories, reducing the common confusion many young people face about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Muskan and Ashish summarize their learning from their parents:
*   **From Mother**: Acceptance of everyone and treating everyone equally, humility, and bonding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, as well as a positive and optimistic outlook, always believing something good comes out of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **From Father**: Business skills, the drive to create one's own identity rather than relying on inherited wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, and the value of never giving up and always treating everyone with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The parents' final advice to their children is to prioritize health, love what they do, and live a disciplined life, which helps in all aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

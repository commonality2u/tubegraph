## The Nature of Love and Marriage

Nora Fatehi expresses a strong belief in love, stating that "nothing is worse than getting married to someone that you don't even love and living with them for years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, she observes that many people in the entertainment industry engage in what she calls "nonsense," marrying for reasons other than love, such as [[marriage_and_relationships | clout]], networking, money, or to maintain relevancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This often leads to sacrificing personal life and [[psychology_in_relationships | mental health]], resulting in unhappiness and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. She believes that mixing work life with personal decisions driven by greed and bad intentions is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

While she believes in love and God, Nora states she does not believe in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

## Gender Dynamics and Societal Roles

The conversation delves into [[gender_and_societal_roles_in_modern_times | gender dynamics and societal roles]], with Nora Fatehi expressing strong opinions:

> [!WARNING] Views on Feminism
> Nora Fatehi explicitly states, "I don't believe in this at all. In fact, I think feminism up our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. She argues that radical feminism has destroyed the family unit and the feminine energy of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. While she supports women's rights and education, she believes feminism has become too extreme, causing societal chaos and mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.

She emphasizes that while men and women are "equal in more sentimental things," they are "not equal in societal things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. She advocates for traditional gender roles, where men serve as providers and breadwinners, and women as nurturers, mothers, and wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. She believes this balance is essential for societal equilibrium, leading to less depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

### Hormonal Cycles and Work-Life Balance

The discussion touches upon the idea that "female physiology was not designed for the 8 to 5 grind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. This is attributed to women operating on a 28-day hormonal cycle, unlike men's 24-hour cycle, making the traditional workday less suitable for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. Women naturally need more sleep, are more creative, and require variation in their schedules to accommodate hormonal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Trying to force women into male-centric corporate settings can lead to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

### The "Right Man" and Feminine Energy

Nora suggests that a "right man" can unlock a woman's true feminine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. For a man to be "right," he needs to embrace his masculine energy by being a provider, supporter, and protector, both physically and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. She notes a societal trend where many men no longer wish to take on these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58">[01:20:58]</a>, having been "brainwashed in the feminism era" to compete with women in all aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

She states that if a man provides money, food, and shelter, a woman should reciprocate by focusing on nurturing, motherhood, and household care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This "old school traditional way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a> is, in her view, what women will increasingly desire as they experience the challenges of the workforce and reconnect with their biological nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>.

### Perceptions of Men and Women

Nora challenges the perception that girls are inherently sweet, cautioning against naivety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. She states that "a lot of women are crazy" and can be conniving, manipulative, and great at portraying a certain image to achieve their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. This manipulation can include emotional manipulation, making partners feel guilty or changing their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>. She suggests that some women might even lie to enter [[expectations_in_relationships | relationships]] with men who initially declined them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.

Similarly, she notes that men are becoming more complex than previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>, facing pressures related to earning money and being a provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>. However, she believes the lack of a nurturing partner makes this struggle more difficult for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Personal Experience
> Nora Fatehi shares that a terrible past relationship experience led her to build a barrier around herself, protecting her aura and spirit. This experience was "deeper, darker, scarier" than generic issues like cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. This has made her wary of allowing people into her vicinity, especially given the calculative nature of some individuals who might exploit [[relationships_and_the_idea_of_marriage | relationships]] for gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. She filters everyone and prefers to stay alone to avoid such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

## Predatory Behavior in Relationships

Nora Fatehi describes predators in all industries, including entertainment, as individuals who "sniff out victims" and use their power to bait people into submissive situations in exchange for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. She states that these predators are calculative and target vulnerable or desperate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. She attributes her own avoidance of such situations to her "intimidating" and direct personality, as she never gives off "desperate vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

She also identifies "clout predators" who feign romantic interest to leverage another person's fame or networking connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. She notes that many in her industry marry for clout, relevancy, or money rather than genuine affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. She finds this predatory because the "other person doesn't even know you're doing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>, believing the relationship is based on love.

## The Role of Intuition in Relationships

Nora emphasizes the importance of intuition in navigating [[relationships and the idea of marriage | relationships]] and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>. She advises that one must be self-aware to connect with and understand one's intuition, learning from past experiences where initial feelings were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. She believes prayer and spiritual practices strengthen intuition and provide a "shield" against negative energies and intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

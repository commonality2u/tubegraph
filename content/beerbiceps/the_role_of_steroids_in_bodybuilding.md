Ronnie Coleman, an eight-time Mr. Olympia winner, discusses the [[bodybuilding_lifestyle_challenges_and_sacrifices | demanding nature of bodybuilding]], including the role of steroids, diet, and mental fortitude in achieving elite physique and strength. He emphasizes that bodybuilding is "probably the hardest sport in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a> due to its continuous, 24/7 commitment.

## Ronnie Coleman's Experience with Steroids

Ronnie Coleman began taking steroids around 1995 or 1996, at approximately 30 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. He was initially "so afraid to do all that stuff back then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. His decision was influenced by seeking information from experienced bodybuilders like Flex Wheeler, who was "quite honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a> and provided guidance that "worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### Health and Monitoring
Coleman stressed the importance of a monitored approach to steroid use:
*   **Doctor-Prescribed**: Everything he put into his body was "doctor prescribed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Regular Check-ups**: He had check-ups every four months to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were functioning correctly, stating, "I've never went six months without checking it, even now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. He never experienced problems with these organs due to his careful monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   **Controlled Dosage**: He confirms he took "normal dosage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a> and believes taking "massive massive amounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a> would have prevented him from being alive today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Healthy Appearance**: Despite his large muscularity, he maintained a healthy appearance, noting his clear skin unlike some others who developed "pimples and all this red marks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

### Perceived Effects and Mindset
Coleman's experience with steroids was not one of drastic, immediate transformation but rather a gradual progression. He didn't initially "see the changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a> in his body until he saw himself in magazines. His mindset was solely focused on competition, viewing steroid use as a necessary step to "compete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a> and win Mr. Olympia titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. He noted that he was already very strong before starting steroids, able to deadlift and squat 700-800 lbs and bench 400 lbs naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

## Steroids and Bodybuilding Culture

Coleman notes a cultural issue in both the US and India where "gym trainers actually give 18-year-old steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. He observes that many individuals pursue steroids unsafely due to a "lust for that kind of a body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>, without considering the necessary precautions or potential harm to their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>. He stresses the importance of extensive research before use, recalling how he "read books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a> to ensure the safest approach possible.

## Identifying Steroid Use

Ronnie Coleman states he can identify steroid use in individuals just by looking at their physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. He looks for specific indicators like shape, thickness, and clear definition, especially in areas like the shoulders, combined with a "lower fat percent than normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **Chris Hemsworth**: Coleman believes Hemsworth's physique is "not naturally achievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a> because he is primarily an actor, not an athlete. The shape and thickness of his shoulders are key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Cristiano Ronaldo**: Ronaldo's body at its peak is considered naturally achievable through "hard work, dedication, eating the right food, eating healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. His later loss of size is seen as a "natural progression of a guy in his 30s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a> and still natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.
*   **Brock Lesnar**: Coleman views Brock Lesnar's physique as "just natural progression of a guy who's worked hard and genetically gifted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. The "lack of definition on his shoulders," arms, and legs indicates a natural build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.
*   **The Rock (Dwayne Johnson)**: Ronnie suspects The Rock has "probably took a little a little bit of something here and there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a> due to his "all kind of cut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a> and defined physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>, considering it "very unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a> he's natural.
*   **Mike Tyson**: Mike Tyson's body is seen as completely natural, similar to Brock Lesnar, without any signs of steroid use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **John Cena**: Coleman believes John Cena has "somewhere long along the way took little little something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>, but possibly only for "short period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>, like "three four months at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Life
Coleman notes that steroids can impact sex drive, stating he was "less turned on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a> while using them, especially when preparing for a show, during which he abstained from sex and masturbation entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. This was because sex "wasn't going to help me win the Olympia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>, unlike food and supplements. He also clarifies that while the increased [[role_of_testosterone_in_mens_health_and_lifestyle_factors | testosterone]] from steroids might make someone seem more turned on, his body was not "used to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a> since he started later in life. He also states that having significant muscle mass did not affect his sex life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ronnie Coleman's perspective on steroids is that while they are a part of professional bodybuilding, they must be used responsibly and under strict medical supervision. His emphasis on continuous learning and finding knowledgeable coaches underscores his approach to mastering the sport, encompassing [[role_of_protein_intake_in_muscle_repair | diet]], training, and recovery to become a champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.

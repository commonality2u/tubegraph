Achieving a great look in a T-shirt hinges on [[importance_of_fit_slim_fit_versus_regular_fit_shirts | selecting the perfect fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Before diving into the specific rules for T-shirt fit, a foundational tip for looking excellent in a T-shirt is to be physically fit yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While you don't need to be a bodybuilder, having above-average arms, chest, and back is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Key Fit Rules

The following guidelines are essential when choosing a T-shirt:

### T-Shirt Length
The T-shirt should not be excessively long, covering your entire crotch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Conversely, it should not be too short; when you lift your arms, no skin should be exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Ideally, a T-shirt's length should end in the middle of your groin region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Sleeve Length and Fit
Opt for sleeves that are short and tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If you have a T-shirt with longer sleeves, consider tailoring them to achieve a tighter and shorter fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, avoid sleeves that are so short they appear attention-seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The ideal sleeve length should just cover your entire shoulder muscle, leaving a good portion of your tricep and bicep exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Torso Fit
A T-shirt should be tight in the upper torso region and looser in the mid-torso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This means everything below the line of your nipples should be slightly looser, and everything above the line of your nipples should be slightly tighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Nipple Visibility
```admonition
Never wear T-shirts so tight that your nipples can be seen through the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Janhvi Kapoor has openly discussed her perspectives on [[Relationships Love and Personal Life | love, relationships]], and personal well-being, reflecting on modern intimacy and her journey of self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of Modern Intimacy

Janhvi observes a contemporary paradox regarding intimacy: while it has become highly accessible and convenient, this accessibility also makes people "too scared to commit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. She feels that this ease of access can prevent individuals from forming "real equations" with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## On Being Single and Seeking a Partner

Kapoor confirms that she is currently single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. While she is generally happy being single, she admits to feeling lonely at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. She wonders why people do not approach her with the intention of asking her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

When asked about her ideal future boyfriend, Janhvi states she would want him to "be nice to me and make me laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. She promises to be good to him, be there for him, make him laugh, and assures a lot of fun, describing herself as "a little psycho but also cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Past Experiences

Kapoor reflects on her journey of self-discovery, stating that she has grown less concerned about catering to a specific image and is now focused on "find[ing] out who I am for myself more than for others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This shift in priority, where she stopped "giving a [expletive]" and started doing things for herself, notably happened after the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

She admits to being an empath, which she believes leads her to attract people who "need to be healed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. She expressed frustration with this pattern, stating, "I only attract things that need to be healed. I'm sick of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Her loneliness is a consequence of past experiences, rather than her current self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. She believes she has "wasted too much of my energy on people that didn't deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

Presently, Janhvi prioritizes her career growth and personal experiences over a romantic relationship, stating, "I don't want a man. I want like more films, more experiences, more growth, and more love from the audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

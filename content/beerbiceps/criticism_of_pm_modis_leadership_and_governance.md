Dr. Subramanian Swamy, a long-standing member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has voiced significant criticisms regarding [[Prime Minister Modis leadership style | Prime Minister Modi's leadership style]] and governance. Despite being part of the BJP, Swamy maintains a highly critical stance, arguing for specific changes in economic and foreign policy, and expressing concerns about democratic values within the party and the nation's future under the current leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

## Allegations of Dishonesty and Credit-Claiming

Swamy accuses PM Modi of telling lies and claiming credit for work he did not contribute to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **Chinese Incursions**: Modi is alleged to have lied about China not having entered Indian territory, specifically stating that nobody has come from China into Indian territory, which Swamy asserts is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Swamy claims that 4,065 square kilometers of undisputed territory in Ladakh has been occupied by China since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **Ram Mandir Project**: Swamy states that it was he who contributed to getting the Supreme Court to clear the Ram Mandir project, but Modi "brazenly" kept him out of functions and took all the credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Concerns over [[BJPs internal dynamics and election strategy | BJP's Internal Dynamics]]

Swamy highlights significant issues within the BJP's internal functioning under Modi's leadership:
*   **Dictatorial Tendencies**: Modi is seen as operating with a "dictatorship" mentality, starting as a democrat but potentially transforming into a "monster," drawing parallels to Hitler and Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.
*   **Submissive Cabinet**: The cabinet is largely composed of individuals "picked up because they would be a cat," lacking a spine, and unwilling to act without Modi's instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Only a couple of ministers like Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari are capable of speaking up frankly, though they are often not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Team Spirit**: There is "no healthy team spirit" within the BJP, described as a "Modi and then Sano Panza" (Man Friday) structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Disruption of Party Constitution**: The BJP's previously "wonderful party Constitution" has been "disrupted," with everything being nominated by Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. Before 2014, there were regular elections and changes in the presidency through voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   **Control over Media**: Swamy claims PM Modi's office has instructed Delhi's English newspapers not to publish anything about him, leading to a four-year absence of his news in most English papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

## [[Corruption and financial issues in Indian politics | Corruption and Economic Mismanagement]]

Swamy asserts that [[corruption and financial issues in Indian politics | corruption]] has become "plunder" in India over the last 10 years, and the BJP government has not adequately addressed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Electoral Bonds**: Swamy describes the electoral bond scheme as a "mighty scandal" which he believes Modi cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. He suggests that bankrupt individuals paid large amounts via bonds to get government contracts, when they should have been jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: There is "no transparency whatsoever" in the government's dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Bogus GDP Data**: Swamy contends that the official GDP growth rates of 8-9% are manipulated and "bogus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. He argues that growth is evaluated at current prices, including inflation, meaning the real growth rate is closer to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Economic Policies Leading to Depression**: If PM Modi remains in power, Swamy, as an economics professor, predicts India will face a "massive depression" by 2030, similar to the 1930s Great Depression in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Wrong Economic Decisions**:
    *   **High Income Tax**: Swamy advocates for abolishing income tax, stating it's primarily collected for the personal pockets of tax officials and ministers and does not go towards national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. He argues it disproportionately affects the middle and upper-middle classes, who are innovators and educated people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
    *   **Hiking Interest Rates**: This discourages investment and economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
    *   **Ignoring Demand Side**: The government focuses on supply without addressing the weak demand side of the economy, leading to inventories growing and poor overall demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
    *   **Unemployment**: Despite claims of progress, there is no decrease in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## [[Indias foreign policy | Foreign Policy]] and Geopolitical Issues

Swamy criticizes Modi's [[Indias foreign policy | foreign policy]] as lacking clarity and being influenced by external pressures:
*   **Lack of Non-Alignment**: India is not aligned with anyone, yet buys "junk" from Russia and trades in rupee-ruble without proper exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Weak Stance on China**: Modi is accused of being blackmailed by China, failing to take a firm stance against Chinese occupation of Indian territory in Ladakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Swamy asserts that India should tell China to "get out" instead of agreeing to "buffer zones" on Indian claimed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   **India's Global Standing**: Swamy believes India is currently "less than third" in global standing, with more respect for countries like France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. He believes India has the potential to be the "first factor" but lacks the necessary political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

## Recommendations for India's Future

To achieve India's potential, Swamy suggests:
*   **Economic Policy Changes**: Implementing [[economic_reforms_in_india | economic reforms]] to grow at 10% per year for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. This includes abolishing income tax to boost demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.
*   **Military Stance Against China**: Militarily defeating the Chinese to recover lost territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
*   **Leadership Change**: Swamy strongly believes that the BJP should fight the coming election without Mr. Modi, as his presence dilutes the party's core Hindutva issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. He considers Modi "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" due to his lack of values and potential for dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. He predicts that if Modi is reinstated, he might try to ensure there are no more elections for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.

## Swamy's Defiance and Future Outlook

Despite his criticisms of the current [[indian_political_landscape | Indian political landscape]] and specific leaders, Swamy remains within the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. He asserts that he is difficult to remove from the party due to his deep roots in the Hindu movement and his articulate promotion of Hindutva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. Swamy expresses unwavering faith in India's future, believing it will be a "great country" and can easily overtake China within five to six years with the right leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. His core philosophy revolves around uniting Hindus by helping them understand their true history and religion, free from outdated concepts and falsehoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

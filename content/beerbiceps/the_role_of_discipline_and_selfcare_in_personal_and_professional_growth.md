Sva Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his success to his practice of celibacy for nine years, believing it gave him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This commitment to self-discipline extends beyond celibacy to a holistic approach to [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | self-development]] and [[work_life_balance_and_self_care | self-care]].

## The Foundation: Yoga and Discipline

Sva's journey into [[the_role_of_discipline_and_the_5_am_club_in_spiritual_growth | discipline]] began at age six when his parents enrolled him in yoga to help him balance and focus for cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He noticed immediate improvements in his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. At 17, he deepened his practice, attending classes that went beyond the physical aspects of yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### The Practice of Sadas (Disciplines)

After initial yoga classes, Sva began practicing 'sadas' â€“ Sanskrit for discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These involve committing to specific practices for set periods, like 10, 11, 21, or 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Examples include:
*   Being silent for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   Meditating for nine hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   Practicing Vipassana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
*   Not touching people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
*   Being mindful of actions in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

Sva observed that each time he completed a sada, he advanced in various aspects of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, such as becoming the captain of his college cricket team when he expected to be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### The Five Precepts

Sva's teacher gave him five precepts, commitments in yoga that bring significant benefits if fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>:
1.  **No Intoxication** No alcohol, no smoking, no non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence** Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing** This includes both physical and mental stealing (coveting others' possessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
4.  **No Lying** Even white lies are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy** No sex, no masturbation, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Initially, Sva adopted these practices to prove his teacher wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. However, after about 1.5 years, they became a way of life, and he has maintained them for nine years without breaking any precept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Benefits of Discipline and Semen Retention

### Enhanced Performance and Creativity
Sva believes that semen retention is linked to performance, as the energy is channeled upwards to the brain, opening up a "different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This enhanced creative energy contributes to peak performance in any profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He suggests trying it for just 21 days to experience the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Increased Attractiveness and Trust
Sva has been told that semen retention makes one more attractive, possibly in an energetic rather than physical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Women are drawn to him because they feel safe and trust him, a feeling he believes comes from his internal energy and lack of physical desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. His definition of attraction has shifted beyond the physical, focusing on qualities like compassion and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### Developing Intuition and Manifestation
His disciplined lifestyle, particularly the practice of not lying, seems to have enhanced his intuition, allowing him to inadvertently manifest positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. He cites instances where his casual predictions for friends came true, suggesting a deeper connection to manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

Sva also shares personal stories of setting ambitious goals, like wanting to work with Christopher Nolan or having Jennifer Lopez invest in his company, and seeing them manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. He attributes this to genuine belief and manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. Intuition, which he calls the "sixth sense" or "third eye" (Ajna chakra), is present in everyone but can be activated and channeled through practices like yoga, pranayama, and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. It can be blocked by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Importance of Meditation
Sva emphasizes the value of breath meditation (anapana from Vipassana), where one focuses on the normal and natural breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. This practice helps bring oneself to the present, increasing focus levels in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. He states that one hour of yoga a day can energize you for the remaining 23 hours, reducing the need for excessive sleep to 4-6 hours of quality rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Success

Sva is the founder of Diva Yoga, described as India's biggest wellness startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Diva Yoga is an all-women, aspirational brand, with a mother brand called SVA (meaning "all complete"), which is unisex and transformational, aiming to connect seven billion breaths globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The company has attracted investments from notable figures like Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malika Arora, Shahid Kapoor, Meera Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Investors typically look at the founder, the business's purpose and scalability, and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Key Life Learnings

Sva shares three critical life lessons:
1.  **Be True and Authentic to Yourself** It's essential to stay authentic and not be overly influenced by external factors or peer pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. The first step towards any goal is to simply take it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **[[work_life_balance_and_self_care | Self-Care]] is Vital** This encompasses both physical and [[mental_discipline_and_the_challenges_of_selfcontrol | mental self-care]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Loving oneself is crucial to taking care of and loving others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. He advises a mix of physical activities (like gym or functional training) and mindful practices (like breathing) to foster [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | self-belief]] and present awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **Be a People Person** Effective [[studying_for_personal_growth_and_future_self | people management]] is crucial, especially for leaders like CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good employer and team member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

By balancing these three principles, Sva believes one can become a more compassionate individual and positively influence the world around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. His personal transformation inspired him to start his yoga company to spread this message of self-care and authentic living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

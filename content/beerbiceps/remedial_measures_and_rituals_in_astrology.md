Astrology, particularly the Hindu system of [[the_abcs_of_indian_astrology | Jotish]], offers various remedial measures and rituals to mitigate negative influences or enhance positive ones in an individual's life. These practices are deeply intertwined with the concept of [[karmic_lessons_and_spiritual_growth | karma]] and spiritual development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## Understanding Karma and its Malleability

In [[the_abcs_of_indian_astrology | Jotish]], there are three main types of karma that influence a person's life and chart:
*   **Drudha (Fixed) Karma**: This karma is considered fixed and unchangeable. Certain combinations in a horoscope indicate that these karmas must be experienced, and no ritual or practice can alter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. For example, if the chart indicates a short lifespan, it's believed that it cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:34">[02:35:34]</a>. Even dedicated spiritual practices may not change these fixed outcomes in the current lifetime, though they may prepare for future lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>.
*   **Drudha-Adrudha (Fixed-Unfixed) Karma**: These karmas can be influenced or lessened through specific remedies (*upaya* or *pariharam*), such as chanting specific [[influence_of_mantras_and_spiritual_practices | mantras]] or performing *pujas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The intensity of a negative outcome might be reduced significantly, for instance, from an intensity of 10 down to 2 or 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Adrudha (Unfixed) Karma**: These karmas represent mere tendencies and are very easy to change. They do not require complex rituals; a strong mind and willpower are sufficient to alter their course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. An example given is exercising and eating less to lose weight, which relies on willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Remedial Measures for Astrological Afflictions

Remedial measures in [[the_abcs_of_indian_astrology | astrology]] aim to make the *grahas* (planetary influences) more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. These can include:

*   **Specific Activities**: Performing actions related to the affected *graha* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Worship of Deities (Devatas)**: Seeking the help of higher forces, as *devatas* are considered more powerful than *grahas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Each *graha* can map to certain *devatas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Chanting Mantras**: Specific [[influence_of_mantras_and_spiritual_practices | mantras]] associated with *grahas* or *devatas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Wearing Gemstones**: Specific gemstones are associated with different *grahas* and can be worn to influence their effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

### Remedies for Specific Grahas (Planets)

*   **Mars (Mangal)**:
    *   **Mangalik Dosha**: Certain combinations of Mars in the 7th or 8th house can cause disturbances in married life, historically believed to cause death to the spouse, now more commonly associated with divorce or separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Remedies for Mangalik Dosha**: Rituals and *pujas* can pacify Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Horoscope matching with another individual who also has a similar *mangalik dosha* can partially cancel out the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. There are also *yoga* cancellations in the chart itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Deities**: [[Spiritual practices for protection against negative entities | Hanuman G]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Kandha (Murugan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Narasimha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Bagalamukhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, and Chamunda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> are associated with Mars and can be worshipped for its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sun**: To rectify an afflicted Sun, one can make donations to government agencies or engage in government-related work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Worship of Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, Lord Rama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, or specific Mahavidyas (like a Davi) can also be recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Moon**: Worship of the Divine Mother or various forms of Davi (Soma, Kali, Shamuna, Tara) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, or Lord Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> can help.
*   **Mercury (Buddha)**: Connected to Lord Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, Tripurasundari (a Mahavidya) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, and Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.# Remedial Measures and Rituals in Astrology

Some of the most fixed karmas are governed by specific positions of Saturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. Even dedicated spiritual practices may not change these fixed outcomes in the current lifetime, though they may prepare for future lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

*   **Worship of Deities (Devatas)**: Seeking the help of higher forces, as *devatas* are considered more powerful than the *grahas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Each *graha* can map to certain *devatas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

*   **Wearing Gemstones**: Specific gemstones are associated with different *grahas* and can be worn to influence their effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

### Remedies for Specific Grahas (Planets)

*   **Mars (Mangal)**:
    *   **Mangalik Dosha**: Certain combinations of Mars in the 7th or 8th house can cause disturbances in married life, historically believed to cause death to the spouse, now more commonly associated with divorce or separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Remedies for Mangalik Dosha**: Rituals and *pujas* can pacify Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Horoscope matching with another individual who also has a similar *mangalik dosha* can partially cancel out the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. There are also *yoga* cancellations in the chart itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Deities**: [[Spiritual practices for protection against negative entities | Hanuman G]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Kandha (Murugan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Narasimha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, Bagalamukhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, and Chamunda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> are associated with Mars and can be worshipped for its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sun**: To rectify an afflicted Sun, one can make donations to government agencies or engage in government-related work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Worship of Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, Lord Rama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, or specific Mahavidyas (like a Davi) can also be recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Moon**: Worship of the Divine Mother or various forms of Davi (Soma, Kali, Shamuna, Tara) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, or Lord Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> can help.
*   **Mercury (Buddha)**: Connected to Lord Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, Tripurasundari (a Mahavidya) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, and Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Venus (Shukra)**: Connected to Lakshmi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a> and Kamalika (a tantric form of Lakshmi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.
*   **Jupiter (Guru)**: Can connect to any deity, but depending on placement, may represent Shiva, a cosmic form of Vishnu, or a powerful form of Ganapati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Matangi is the Mahavidya that represents Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.
*   **Saturn (Shani)**:
    *   **Qualities**: Likes hard work, discipline, and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Dislikes ego, arrogance, and lack of discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.
    *   **Remedies**: To make Saturn more favorable, one can perform menial tasks that cultivate humility, such as cleaning toilets oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
    *   **Deities**: Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a> and Kali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a> are powerful deities for controlling Saturn. Chanting the [[spiritual_practices_for_protection_against_negative_entities | Hanuman Chalisa]] is also a very popular and effective remedy, provided it is done with significant dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.
*   **Rahu**:
    *   **Deities**: Madura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>, Bhairava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>, and Chinnamasta (a Mahavidya) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a> are powerful in controlling Rahu. Certain *sadhanas* related to [[spiritual_practices_for_protection_against_negative_entities | Hanuman G]] can also control Rahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
    *   **Eclipses (Grahan)**: While temples close and traditional observances are followed during eclipses due to disturbed Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>, these periods are also considered extremely potent for [[Karma and Meditation | spiritual practices]], allowing one to achieve in hours what might normally take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
*   **Ketu**:
    *   **Deities**: Ganapati (Ganesh) is considered the best deity to worship for controlling Ketu, as his head was replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:13">[02:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:27">[02:17:27]</a>. Feeding fishes is also associated with Ketu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>. Dhumavati (a Mahavidya) is used in [[role_of_mantras_and_their_placement_in_tantra | Tantra]] to control Ketu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

## Role of Gemstones and Crystals

Gemstones are a recognized remedial measure in [[the_abcs_of_indian_astrology | astrology]], where specific stones are recommended based on the astrological chart to balance planetary influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The effectiveness of a gemstone depends on the individual's horoscope and must be determined by a knowledgeable astrologer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Crystals are also believed to hold energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, though the speaker notes a lack of extensive personal experience with them. It's generally understood that using crystals will not negatively impact one's karma, especially if used with good intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. However, they are more likely to influence the "unfixed" (Adrudha) and "fixed-unfixed" (Drudha-Adrudha) karmas, rather than the "fixed" (Drudha) karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Astrology and Spiritual Progress

Astrology can also be used as a tool for [[karmic_lessons_and_spiritual_growth | spiritual growth]]. Strong *grahas* in the 12th house, for example, can indicate a strong meditative capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>. Astrologers themselves, in traditional times, would engage in [[spiritual_practices_for_protection_against_negative_entities | spiritual practices]] and seek connection with deities like Ganapati to enhance their intuition and predictive accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

True spiritual progress, which can help navigate challenging karmic periods, comes from developing a deep connection with one's *Ishta Devata* (chosen deity). This connection provides guidance and protection, helping one to bypass or lessen the impact of karmic momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>. It's akin to having a "bodyguard" that helps nullify karmic effects, turning a severe event (like a leg amputation) into a minor one (a pinprick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a>. This level of spiritual achievement, however, is not easy and typically comes at a very advanced stage of the spiritual journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:48">[02:01:48]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations in Astrology

Astrology is considered a powerful *Vidya* (knowledge) that should be respected and not misused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:11">[02:17:11]</a>. Frivolous use, such as checking one's horoscope daily, can weaken the mind and lead to inaccurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:45">[01:56:45]</a>. Astrology works best when approached with a serious question or difficulty, not for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>.

The art of prediction in [[the_abcs_of_indian_astrology | Jotish]] requires not only memorizing texts but also developing intuition and gaining inspiration from deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Misuse of astrological knowledge can lead to a decline in predictive accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Nature, acting as a "big boss," ensures that power is only given to those who deserve it and will not misuse it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

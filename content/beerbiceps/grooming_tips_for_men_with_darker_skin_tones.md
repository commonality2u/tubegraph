This article provides [[basic_male_grooming_for_indian_men | basic male grooming]] and [[fashion_tips_for_indian_men | fashion tips for Indian men]] and those with slightly darker skin tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Idea of "Fairness"

The concept that fair skin is superior to dark skin originated during the imperialistic age when European countries conquered other parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This thought process unfortunately persisted in Asian, African, and South American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Ads for products like "Fair and Lovely" reinforced the idea that fairness was necessary for better job prospects or finding love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. However, the secret behind "fairness" lies in imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

It's important to remember that skin color is genetic and should not be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Instead, focus on making your skin the best version of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. In 2018, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Promoting the idea that dark skin doesn't look good or that one should get rid of a suntan is promoting racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Skincare Tips for Glowing Skin

### Do Not Chase Skin Whitening

Avoid skin whitening and skin whitening creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. These products contain harmful substances such as hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil the quality of your skin in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Achieving a Natural Glow

To achieve healthy, glowing skin:

*   **For Dry Skin:** After washing your face, dry it with a towel and apply a mild moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Moisturizer is essential if you have dry skin that flakes off or very dry lips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **For Oily Skin:** Consider a home remedy using Multani Mitti (Fuller's earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    1.  Buy a block of Fuller's earth from an Indian grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    2.  Chip off a piece and pound it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    3.  Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric (haldi) into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
    4.  Squeeze a little lemon and add a few drops of water to create a smooth paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    5.  Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry for no longer than 20 minutes before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
    6.  Turmeric cleans the face as an antiseptic, lemon helps increase glow, and Fuller's earth absorbs oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
    *   >[!WARNING]
        Do not use this mixture more than once or twice a week (e.g., with a 3-day gap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Overdoing it can cause your skin to secrete more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. You may see a change in your face within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This specific home remedy could be considered part of a [[skincare_routine_for_men_with_oily_skin | skincare routine for men with oily skin]].

### Exfoliation

To get glowing, baby-like skin, use a face scrub, which is a face wash with small, hard particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

*   **Application:** Massage your face firmly in a circular direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Press hard enough to feel a slight tingling sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** The hard particles increase blood circulation to your face, promoting new skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   >[!WARNING]
    Do not use this method if you are very acne-prone or have active acne, as it can harm inflammations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** If not acne-prone, exfoliate no more than once a week, perhaps on Sundays or the same day you apply the Multani Mitti mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Diet for Clear, Glowing Skin

Focus on your diet for clear, glowing skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>:

*   **Hydration:** Stay hydrated throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Aim for clear urine for most of the day; if it's yellow, drink more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Prioritize vegetables, which are more nutritionally dense than fruits, providing more vitamins and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Incorporate a variety of vegetable colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Beyond skin color, focus on looking neater to appear more handsome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

*   **Beards:** If you choose to keep a beard, maintain it well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Use beard grooming products or at least trim it neatly to avoid looking like a "big bush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Patchy Beards:** If you have a patchy beard that grows in spots, it's generally best to avoid a beard entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. A patchy beard can make you look scruffy, which is not good for your appearance or corporate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Options:** Either go completely clean-shaven if your beard is patchy, or grow it out fully and meticulously take care of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Virat Kohli's neat beard is an example of a well-maintained beard that enhances looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Importance of Physique

Your skin color is less important than your physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. A good physique accounts for almost 90% of your ability to pull off any clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. You don't need to be a bodybuilder or ripped, but you should look healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This means having filled-out arms, chest, and working your legs and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. A good physique can be achieved even through home workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. If you have a good physique, you can wear almost any color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

### Color Choices Based on Physique

*   **For Very Skinny or Plus-Sized Individuals:** If you are very skinny or slightly on the fatter side, you need to be more mindful of bright colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Bright colors like white, red, orange, and bright blue highlight your physique and draw attention to your body, especially since your skin tone contrasts with the shirt color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. In these situations, avoid brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   **Ideal Colors for Darker Skin Tones:** Give priority to darker colors for your t-shirts and shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Colors like black, navy blue, brown, olive green, dark gray, and dark maroon match very well with a slightly dark, wheatish Indian skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

## Final Advice: Positivity and Confidence

More important than grooming and fashion tips is developing positivity and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. People are attracted to internal qualities more than external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. The most crucial action is to learn to love yourself and be comfortable in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Your natural skin color is how you are born and will remain for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

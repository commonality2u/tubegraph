Logos and branding on T-shirts can significantly impact how an outfit is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. A logo can draw attention and create a contrast in the viewer's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Societal Perception

In many societies, individuals are judged based on the clothes and brands they wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   Wearing and flaunting a budget-friendly brand might lead to certain perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, flaunting a high-end brand might cause others to view the wearer as a "show off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Aesthetic Considerations

Beyond societal judgment, T-shirts often look better without any logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This is because simplicity is considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Choosing simpler designs, including avoiding large or contrasting logos, aligns with dressing higher on the [[tshirt_maturity_scale_and_ageappropriate_dressing | t-shirt maturity scale]] to appear slightly older and more elegant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> It is generally advised to avoid wearing T-shirts with prominent logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

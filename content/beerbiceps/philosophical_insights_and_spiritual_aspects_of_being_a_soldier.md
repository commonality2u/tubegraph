Major Viv Jacob, a highly respected and battle-hardened veteran of the Indian Special Forces, offers profound philosophical and spiritual insights into the unique life experience of a soldier, particularly those in [[special_forces_mindset_and_training | Special Forces]]. His conversations delve into the nature of reality, consciousness, and the extreme situations that shape a person's understanding of self and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:02">[02:04:02]</a>.

## The Special Forces Mindset
The Special Forces, described as the highest efficiency part of the [[cultural_and_operational_dynamics_of_the_indian_army | Indian Armed Forces]], are composed of individuals who have lived a very different life, shaped by multiple [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. Major Jacob emphasizes that Special Forces embody a mindset that develops over time, acknowledging that every human being is uniquely special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The realization of one's own specialness forms a neural network, evolving through experiences towards self-realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:12">[08:10:12]</a>. This cultivated mindset allows for a directed energy, focused by the armed forces to address national security concerns and ensure a safer country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:20">[08:41:20]</a>.

Special Forces operations are akin to "creative destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. They have an open-ended mandate, prepared to execute anything, anywhere, anytime, with precise and concise energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

## Confronting Chaos and Achieving Flow State
Life in the [[military_training_and_life_in_the_indian_army | military]], especially in active combat, involves constant exposure to life-and-death situations, where the chances of survival can feel like 50/50 every time a soldier leaves base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. In such extreme circumstances, soldiers must forget about calculations of risk and exist purely in the now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>.

A crucial aspect of a soldier's ability to operate in chaos is entering a "flow state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This involves surrendering to the situation, which leads to acceptance, then awareness, and finally the ability to make the critical choice that can determine life or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Major Jacob recounts a personal experience during an operation where his teammate stepped on a mine and lost a leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Despite extreme anxiety and an instinctive desire to withdraw, he stayed put, lacking a logical reason to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This mental battle, where he believed his desire to retreat was due to laziness, ultimately led to him staying and engaging in repair mode, assessing the wound, and stemming blood loss to extend his teammate's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The extreme nature of [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat]] means that mistakes can lead to death or severe injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Unlike civilian life where one might lose money or reputation, in the Special Forces, a mistake means someone's life is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This constant proximity to death forces a dissolution of ego and a deep dive into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Near-Death Experiences and Expanded Consciousness
Exposure to consistent life-and-death situations can lead to profound spiritual awakenings. Soldiers in active combat frequently face a "barrier" where death is always a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. When crossing this psychological barrier, one must "cross your mind" and let go of duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

> "You don't exist in Duality all life all experiences happens in Duality there is black and then there is white and then there's all the shades in between that black and white and that's life... but when you go out of your base you have to you have to cross this you have to basically cross your mind you have to let go of your mind and and and when you you go out you focus completely in the now there is no past there is no future there is only the now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>

In this flow state, spirit and matter, black and white, become singular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This opens up the spiritual aspect of existence, allowing one to enter a dimension where chaos exists through surrender, acceptance, awareness, and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Major Jacob describes developing a "sixth sense" or intuition over time, enabling him to predict when something was about to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This ability arises from consciously connecting with something beyond the five senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. It is a process of expanding beyond gross reality, becoming "lighter and lighter" into a spiritual realm, where space, time, and energy are one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This allows for the download of information from a "higher place" â€“ ultimately from oneself, as the "eye" or ego dissolves, revealing the true self, or Supreme Consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

He recounts a near-death experience while stuck on a cliff, where he faced an enemy soldier with no escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. In that moment, he experienced a "life flash," seeing his entire life like a photo album with videos, but without emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This phenomenon, potentially a burst of DMT in the brain as science suggests, involved time dilation, allowing years of life to be observed in no time at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This experience transformed him, revealing that reality is an illusion where all possibilities exist simultaneously, like a matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. He attributes his survival to an "alternative form of reality" where the exact opposite of what should have happened, did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Karma and Perception
When asked about karma, Major Jacob offers a nuanced view: it exists for those whose neural networks are formed to perceive it as real, operating on cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. However, for "consciousnesses which have zoomed out," karma is an illusion, like everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. He suggests that the perception of reality, including karma, is subjective, like three different artists painting different pictures with the same colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Soldiers who carry regret and guilt do so based on their perspective, but by stepping back and zooming out beyond judgment, one can see the actual picture of what is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Connection with Nature and Instinct
[[Mindset and training of special forces soldiers | Special Forces soldiers]] often operate in raw nature, deep forests, and high-altitude mountains, away from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This environment fosters a unique connection, allowing them to merge with nature not only physically but also at a deeper consciousness level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Major Jacob shares two remarkable encounters with wild animals:
1.  **The Leopard:** While on Sentry duty at night, he heard a noise and, upon activating his night vision goggles, found a leopard sitting less than a meter away, staring in the same direction he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. He prepared to fire but the leopard calmly got up and walked away after several minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. He realized they were both in alignment and peace, observing the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Animals operate on instinct, which is seen as a "spiritual dimension," operating beyond judgment and solely in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This lack of fear or "thinking" from the soldier's side creates a peaceful co-existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Additionally, living in the wild for weeks without bathing causes soldiers to "smell like the forest," making them familiar to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
2.  **The Charging Bear:** While observing a target from a cliff edge, two large bears, whose cave he had unknowingly occupied earlier, approached his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. One bear charged, stopping within two meters, roaring in his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Despite having his weapon ready, he remained in a flow state, focused on its potential swipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. His teammate used a laser light to startle the bear, causing it to stumble back and leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Bears are incredibly dangerous, with immense strength and sharp claws capable of tearing a person apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. A mother bear with cubs is considered the most dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## The Illusion of Reality and the Cosmic Dream
Major Jacob shares profound [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | insights on life, death, and rebirth in spiritual philosophy]], proposing that all of reality is an illusion or a dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. He likens it to Vishnu dreaming the cosmos, with humans being characters in that dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Just as a dream feels real while experiencing it but dissolves upon waking, so too is our current reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Realizing this allows for the ability to "dream the dream you wish to dream," suggesting that reality is moldable by one's consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Soul of Steel: Realizing Human Potential
Major Jacob's post-military initiative, "Soul of Steel," aims to create "human ability biomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This program combines military, mountaineering, and [[combat_experience_and_mentality | combat experiences]] with adventure mountaineering skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It teaches unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, survival skills, and navigation, putting participants in real-world situations in the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The core belief is that everyone has a "god" within them â€“ a supreme consciousness with supreme ability and realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The program seeks to create circumstances and an environment that helps individuals realize this inner "godliness," unleashing their potential, and fostering more open human beings who spread love, joy, peace, and capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This program is for anyone, from those with disabilities to Olympic athletes, to help them understand who they are and realize their inner potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Major Jacob's insights highlight that the experiences of soldiers, particularly those in [[special_forces_mindset_and_training | Special Forces]], offer a concentrated version of universal human experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The constant confrontation with life and death accelerates the journey of self-discovery and spiritual realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. He emphasizes that ultimately, every human being, regardless of profession or nationality, is "Consciousness expressing itself in infinite number of forms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. By understanding that reality is a shared dream and letting go of judgment and ego, individuals can live more expansive and collaborative lives, fostering love and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Astrological charts are often seen as blueprints of an individual's life, predicting future events and personality traits. However, from a spiritual perspective, these charts are not fixed destinies but rather an "opening balance sheet" of the soul's past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karmas]] and sanskars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

## Astrological Charts: An Opening Balance Sheet
An astrological chart, typically prepared shortly after birth, details potential life events at various ages, including marriage and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This chart is based on the [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] and sanskars (emotional patterns or nature) that the soul carries from previous lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Just as a closing balance sheet from one financial year becomes the opening balance sheet for the next, a soul's past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] creates the astrological chart for its new birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The [[astrologys_role_in_predicting_personal_and_worldly_events | influence of planets]] in astrology is understood as their impact on these ingrained sanskars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

## Karma and the Experience of Success
The concept of [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] explains why some individuals achieve success with minimal effort, while others struggle despite working "extremely hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. What appears as unfairness is merely the manifestation of "visible [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]]" in the current life, combined with "very good [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karmas]]" performed by the soul in previous "costumes" (lifetimes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Success, therefore, is a consequence of the soul's accumulated work across lifetimes, not just the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This means nothing is based on "luck"; everything is "pred decided by the [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] I the soul choose to create" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## Sanskar: The Soul's Emotional Patterns
Sanskar refers to the inherent nature or emotional patterns of a soul, such as trust, doubt, criticism, or appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. These are deep-seated patterns carried from past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. For example, a newborn baby's distinct personality traits, like being smiling or grumpy, are attributed to the sanskars carried by the soul from a previous "costume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Every soul possesses all sanskars, and their expression in a lifetime can be influenced by social conditioning or personal choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

## Interplay between Free Will, Fate, and Karma
While an astrological chart reflects past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] and sanskars, it acts as a "probability manual" rather than a fixed "reality manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The current life's choices and actions (present [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]]) can alter these predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

> "So the [[astrologys_role_in_predicting_personal_and_worldly_events | astrological prediction]] is only a prediction so the word prediction needs to be underlined it's only a prediction which means it's a probability reality will be decided by the individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>

### Spiritual Practices and Their Influence
[[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | Meditation]] and other [[Spiritual practices and their influence on astrology | spiritual practices]] are crucial for transforming one's sanskars and raising one's vibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. This internal shift allows an individual to face the consequences of past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] without suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. It's akin to building "spiritual stamina," enabling a person to respond to challenging situations calmly instead of reacting with lower vibrational emotions like anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

### Impact on Relationships and Life Events
All close relationships are based on "karmic accounts" from previous interactions, not just from this lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Whether a relationship is harmonious or challenging, it reflects past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. [[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | Spiritual practice]] helps to create positive [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karmic accounts]] and resolve uncomfortable ones, allowing individuals to radiate positive energy even when not reciprocated, thus settling past [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karmic accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

Similarly, even events like marriage or divorce, which might appear "pred decided" in a chart, can be altered by conscious efforts to change one's present [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. The ability to shift one's approach to life stems from energized inner being cultivated through [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

In essence, while astrological charts provide insight into the soul's accumulated [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] and sanskars, they are not unchangeable decrees. Through conscious effort and [[Impact of spirituality and meditation on personal life | spiritual practices]], individuals can alter their present [[Karma and its impact on lifes success and outcomes | karma]] and reshape their reality, demonstrating the profound [[Interplay between free will fate and Karma | interplay between free will, fate, and Karma]].

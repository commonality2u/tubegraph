Major Vivek Jacob is widely regarded as one of the most legendary modern-day figures of the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Indian Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He is a veteran of the Indian Para Special Forces (SF), which is considered the most advanced part of the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Indian Army]] and one of the most respected regiments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His experiences include intense combat situations that leave a lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Path to the Indian Army and Special Forces

The journey to joining the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Indian Army]] often begins with the National Defence Academy (NDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Aspirants decide whether they wish to join the Air Force, Army, or Navy even before entering NDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. After clearing various merit-based stages, cadets are classified into their chosen service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Training is similar for all services until the fourth term of NDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. In the fifth and sixth terms, training becomes specialized; for example, Air Force cadets learn to fly gliders, Navy cadets focus on navigation, and Army cadets delve into weapon training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Upon completing NDA training, Army cadets proceed to the Indian Military Academy (IMA) for about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. During this final year at IMA, cadets opt for a specific regiment within the [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army | Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. This choice is based on a merit list, which is prepared based on performance in service subjects, physical performance, sports, and leadership qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The top-ranking cadets ("super block") get to choose their preferred regiment, given a vacancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:10]</a>. The overall objective of this grading system is to ensure a balanced distribution of personalities and talent across all regiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Volunteering for Special Forces

To join the Special Forces, individuals must volunteer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. They sign a volunteer form and provide three options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This act of volunteering itself is the first level of clearance, as it takes immense courage to opt for further intense training after years in the academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. In Major Jacob's batch, 33-34 people volunteered for Special Forces, an unusually high number attributed to inspiring Special Forces instructors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.

## The Special Forces Mindset

Major Jacob describes the Special Forces as a "state of mind" or a "state of consciousness level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>. It signifies being exploratory by nature and willing to commit everything, even one's life, to explore further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. While external perceptions might focus on who is "more badass," those within the Special Forces understand it's about a particular mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

Key aspects of the Special Forces mindset include:
*   **Exploratory Spirit**: A constant desire to know and explore more, pushing boundaries, even at the cost of personal safety and attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   **Instinct in Combat**: Possessing the instinct to handle what is encountered during exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Special Forces represent the highest form of efficiency a human can achieve in this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:04]</a>. They are a "surgical instrument" chosen for specific, high-stakes tasks in national security, both within and outside national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Unwavering Choice**: The ability to make a choice and stick by it, even in chaotic and life-threatening situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. This determines whether someone will act with clarity or confusion in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>.

## [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process | Indian Special Forces Selection and Training Process]]

The [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process | Indian Special Forces selection and training process]] is designed to be intensely challenging, breaking down an individual's ego and preconceived perceptions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. The energy expended during selection shatters existing beliefs, allowing instructors to see the true essence of a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. This process determines if a candidate can be trusted in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>.

Major Jacob describes a "dual process" where recruits are simultaneously broken down and trained efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. This includes training in:
*   Explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>
*   Unarmed combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>
*   Weapon training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>
*   Endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>
*   Navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>
*   Emergency medical first response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>
*   Survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>

Training often means days without sleep, starting as early as 4:00-4:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. Recruits, including officers and soldiers, live, eat, and train together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. Major Jacob recounted his experience as an officer in probation, where after a full day of rigorous training, he would have to attend dinner in the officer's mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>. There, he was expected to memorize vast amounts of information about unit history, trophies, and the stories of fallen comrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>. Failing to answer questions would lead to punishment, such as circling the entire Battalion every half hour through the night, followed by a demanding physical endurance test in the morning, where top performance was still expected despite lack of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:01]</a>.

This grueling process, which for Major Jacob lasted six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>, leads to significant self-realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. It teaches individuals what their body, mind, and heart are capable of, and reveals that "nothing is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>. This realization is the "chief weapon" of a Special Forces operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>.

A critical part of the training involves constant interaction with their assigned weapon. Major Jacob received an AK-47 on his first day in the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:37:00">[42:37:00]</a>. For six months, this weapon remained a literal part of his body, tied to him even during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. Losing the weapon or any of its crucial parts would mean immediate dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>. This intense bond fostered such muscle memory that the weapon became an extension of his body, leading to instinctive and accurate firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a>.

## Combat Experiences and Lessons

Combat, unlike training, is "Touch and Go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. It is a constant process of "Life Death Life Death Duality at its cutting edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>. Major Jacob believes that the more one experiences combat, the more one evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>. Combat refines instinct and can lead to a heightened sense of intuition, allowing operators to predict situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.

### First Combat Experience

Major Jacob recalls his first combat experience where he was initially assigned to observe from a mountain top with a radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>. However, driven by curiosity, he chose to follow the combat squads into a deep ravine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23:00">[40:23:00]</a>. Once bullets and bombs began to explode, it was "pure Instinct" that took over; his body simply knew what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:09]</a>. Special Forces aim for quick, decisive engagements: "go in hit smash out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[44:09:00]</a>. Unlike controlled sports shooting, combat is chaos, requiring instinctive, single-shot accuracy to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>.

### Most Challenging Mission

The most challenging experience for Major Jacob was when one of his men was severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:00">[47:35:00]</a>. Despite the dire situation, he experienced an unparalleled sense of calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>. His small, heavily-laden team was in a treacherous location when a team member's leg was blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:33:00">[48:33:00]</a>. Within five minutes, the team formed a protective circle, administered morphine and IVs, bandaged the spurting wound, and stabilized the casualty, despite the lack of a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:07]</a>.

The injured soldier, despite the horrific injury and facing imminent death, remained remarkably calm and even suggested chopping off his foot if it was necessary to save him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>. This resilience was matched by a young, relatively new team member who, despite his own injuries from a falling rock, carried the wounded man on his back up the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.

The most profound challenge for Major Jacob during this mission was a growing feeling of "dread" on the fifth day, a sensation he had never experienced in combat before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>. This dread, so intense it couldn't be suppressed, made him question his desire to remain in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a>. He resisted the urge to order extraction and remained, and shortly after, the incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>. His decision not to immediately react to the contact, but to wait five minutes for the team leader to report, demonstrated immense trust and leadership under chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:15:00">[59:15:00]</a>. The team successfully extracted the injured soldier by 3:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

Major Jacob has never been hit by a bullet in his nine and a half years of Special Forces combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. He attributes this to a conscious choice and the constant testing of that choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

## Leadership and Brotherhood in Special Forces

Leadership, for Major Jacob, is fundamentally about "responsibility" and the ability to take it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. In combat, hierarchy dissolves, and true leadership emerges from action and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

A crucial aspect of Special Forces dynamics is "love" and "trust" among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This love forms after trust, and it is this "love vibration" that enables the team to penetrate and overcome any obstacle with efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. Without it, failure and severe consequences are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.

Major Jacob recounted an ambush situation early in his career where his team was pinned down by machine gun fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. In that moment of chaos, he realized "the man who stands now and returns fire, he's the leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. He stood up and fired back, prompting others to follow, which allowed them to control the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. This act demonstrated that respect in combat is not earned by rank but by who you are and your ability to remain centered and efficient in chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

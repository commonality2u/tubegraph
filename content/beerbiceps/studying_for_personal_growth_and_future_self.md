Studying is a constant that you cannot change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While most students would prefer to relax or play games, rather than study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, it is a necessary part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The key lies in changing your [[changing_perspective_towards_studying | perspective towards studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Shifting Your Perspective

Instead of viewing studying as a tedious process, consider it a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers, famously stated he hated every minute of training, but endured by telling himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This mindset applies directly to studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The Internal Opponent
Unlike a boxer facing an external opponent, your biggest challenge in studying and in life is yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Students who perform well in exams dislike studying as much as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>; they are not inherently smarter or more talented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Their advantage is a greater hunger for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This internal hunger is what you should cultivate if you're seeking motivation for exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Studying for Your Future Self

Don't study to impress your parents, friends, or for future marks or pay packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The primary reason to study is for the future version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Your goal should be to train so rigorously that you reach a position where you don't have to worry about failing or receiving poor grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. You should know every answer and perform like a heavyweight champion, regardless of the exam questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Choosing the Harder Path
When faced with the option to skip a difficult paragraph or question, always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Ask yourself if you merely want to pass or if you want to place yourself in the best possible position for your future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## The Role of [[the_role_of_discipline_and_selfcare_in_personal_and_professional_growth | Discipline]]

[[selfdiscipline_and_studying | Discipline]] is the act of choosing what you want the most over what you want right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. In moments of laziness, when you could give less than your 100%, choose instead to give 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This effort and motivation should come from a deep internal place, not for external validation, but solely for your own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This contributes significantly to [[personal_growth_and_selfdiscovery | personal growth and self-discovery]].

### Championship Mindset
You have the choice: be remembered as just another boxer who lost battles against themselves, or as the greatest of all time when it comes to studying and achieving your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The ultimate rule in life is "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, reflecting a commitment to [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | personal growth and purpose]] and [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | building self-confidence]].

Save Shashi, a young Indian entrepreneur, attributes his significant success to his nine-year practice of [[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | celibacy]] and [[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | nofap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He believes this practice has granted him a "superpower" to achieve his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This discipline, combined with [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]], has been instrumental in building one of India's largest wellness startups, SVA, and its women-focused brand, Diva Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Notable investors in his wellness ecosystem include Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malika Arora, Shahid and Mira Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Sva Shashi's Journey into Celibacy

Shashi's life is divided into two periods: before and after age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Initially, he was super hyper, leading his parents to enroll him in a [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] class at age six to improve balance and focus for his cricket aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. His serious engagement with [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] began at 17, influenced by a teacher who emphasized self-enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

After physical [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] practices, he started performing "sadas" (disciplines), which are commitments for specific durations (e.g., 10, 11, 21, or 40 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Examples include remaining silent for 40 days or meditating for 9 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Each completed sada led to advancements in his life, both personally and professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

His teacher then introduced five precepts, which, in [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]], signify a commitment against which one should not go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:
1.  **No intoxicants**: No alcohol, smoking, or non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-violence**: Through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No mental or physical stealing**: Aspiring is fine, but not mentally stealing from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **No lying**: Even white lies are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **[[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | Celibacy]]**: Defined as no sex, no masturbation, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Initially, [[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | celibacy]] was committed for seven years, starting at age 18, when it's considered prime time for self-focus and inner growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. After about a year and a half, these five precepts, including [[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | semen retention]], became a way of life for Shashi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He has not broken any of them for nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## The Benefits of Semen Retention

### Enhanced Energy and Creativity
[[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | Semen retention]] involves channeling [[the_concept_of_sexual_energy_and_its_importance_in_ancient_texts | sexual energy]] upwards to the brain, rather than releasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This process reportedly unlocks a "completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Shashi describes feeling increased stamina and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Improved Performance and Confidence
The re-channelled energy significantly enhances performance in various aspects, from sports (like cricket) to professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. It can also lead to increased confidence in social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The physical tiredness often felt after ejaculation is notably absent with [[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | semen retention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### Increased Attraction and Trust
Shashi has been told that [[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | semen retention]] makes a person more attractive, perhaps due to an energetic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. People, especially women, are drawn to him and feel safe, seeing him as trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This stems from a conscious choice not to view others purely through a physical lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Shifted Perception of Attraction
Practicing [[Semen Retention and Its Benefits | semen retention]] alters the definition of attraction, moving beyond superficial physical traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Instead of lust, the individual cultivates compassion and love for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. When faced with lustful thoughts, Shashi consciously transforms that energy into compassion and love for himself and the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## The Role of Yoga and Meditation in Managing Sexual Energy

Specific [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] and [[importance_of_meditation | meditation]] techniques help manage and re-channel [[the_concept_of_sexual_energy and its importance in ancient texts | sexual energy]]. A simple exercise involves visualizing the energy flowing from the sexual organs up the spine into the brain with each deep breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This helps spread the energy throughout the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Advanced meditation schools like Osho, Isha Foundation, YSS, and Chinmaya Mission School teach these methods for controlling and transforming sexual energy into creative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Physical [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | asanas]], exercises, and breathing practices also aid in channeling this energy effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

Shashi's intensive [[importance_of_meditation | meditation]] practice is "Anapana of Vipassana," which involves focusing on the natural flow of breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. This practice helps to stay present and significantly increases focus levels in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. He states that an hour of [[role_of_meditation_and_yoga_in_managing_sexual_energy | yoga]] per day can provide energy for the remaining 23 hours, reducing the need for excessive sleep to 4-6 hours, as quality of sleep is more critical than quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Enhanced Intuition and Manifestation

A [[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | spiritual lifestyle]], including [[Impact of nofap on personal growth and entrepreneurship | nofap]], significantly enhances intuition, often referred to as the Sixth Sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. This means knowing things before they happen, understanding people's vibes, and making timely decisions at life's crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. While Shashi has never consciously used his intuition for career gain (as spirituality is about being in the present) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>, intuitive moments have naturally occurred.

He cites instances where his words manifested reality, like his friend's burnt dress or a visa approval on a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. He also shares a personal story of manifesting his dream of working with Christopher Nolan and having Jennifer Lopez invest in his company, despite initial ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. This highlights the power of belief and manifestation. Intuition, while innate in everyone, can be blocked by intoxicants and negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The Ajna chakra, or third eye, is associated with intuition and can be activated through practices like pranayama and [[importance_of_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## Key Learnings from a Yogic Life

Shashi offers three core life lessons from his [[Celibacy and Spiritual Growth | yogic life]]:
1.  **Authenticity**: Be true to yourself and don't be swayed by external pressures or peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The first step towards any goal is always the hardest but essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Self-care**: Prioritize both physical and mental self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. One must love and take care of themselves first to effectively care for or love others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. This includes a mix of physical activity (gym, functional training) and mindful practices (breathing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
3.  **People Person**: Being good at people management is crucial in all aspects of life, especially in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Employees often leave employers, not companies, highlighting the importance of being a good leader and fostering strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

These collective practices lead to becoming a more compassionate person, inspiring one to spread positive messages and contribute to a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Shashi concludes with the sentiment: "Love like there is no tomorrow, and if tomorrow comes, love again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

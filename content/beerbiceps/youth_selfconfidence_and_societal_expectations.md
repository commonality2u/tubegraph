The journey of youth, particularly for entrepreneurs navigating the burgeoning digital landscape, often involves a complex interplay between personal ambition, developing [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | self-confidence]], and the pervasive influence of [[cultural_changes_and_societal_expectations | societal expectations]]. This is exemplified by the experiences of Goami and Ab, the 21-year-old founders of Slayy Point, a prominent YouTube channel in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

## Balancing Academic and Entrepreneurial Pursuits

Goami and Ab, despite being "India's top YouTubers" at 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, faced the challenge of managing both their college studies and the demands of their growing YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. A strict 75% college attendance requirement meant they could not miss more than one day a week, necessitating intense work schedules to complete shoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Their [[role_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_character | upbringing]] instilled a strong emphasis on academics, making it non-negotiable to compromise on studies for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. They treated both studies and YouTube with equal importance, dedicating themselves fully to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This discipline, along with proper scheduling and prioritization, paradoxically led to an increase in their academic marks since starting YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This improvement was attributed to a greater efficiency in time management, allowing them to accomplish more in shorter periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## Parental Perspectives and Societal Doubts

Initially, Goami and Ab's parents struggled to comprehend their YouTube venture, viewing it simply as "posting memes on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Over time, as the channel grew, parents began to acknowledge the real-world skills their children were acquiring, such as speaking skills, business acumen, and brand interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

However, parents often expressed demotivating doubts, questioning the longevity and fruitfulness of a career in YouTube, suggesting that it "isn't going to last anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> and advising them to pursue traditional paths like a Master's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. They also expressed concerns about the youngsters' ability to run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Despite these open doubts, the parents secretly wished for their YouTube success and were proud, though they refrained from showing it openly to keep their children "grounded" and "humble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Self-Confidence Amidst Criticism

A significant challenge for young people, including Goami and Ab, is a pervasive lack of [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | self-confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This often stems from a perception that they are "too young" or "too small" to achieve significant success, hindering their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Additionally, external pressures from peers and online "haters" can damage [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Building Confidence
*   **Proving Through Action:** Goami and Ab combat demotivation by consistently proving their capabilities through tangible results, such as brand deals and growing fan bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Practical Experience:** YouTube provided them with invaluable practical skills not typically taught in college, including public speaking, brand negotiation, and handling criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Hosting events like the red carpet, initially daunting, became a catalyst for gaining significant [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | confidence]] in public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Negativity:** They learned the crucial skill of "pressure handling criticism and ignoring what other people are saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, recognizing that it's impossible to please everyone, especially in the public eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs:** They recently realized they were "limiting ourselves too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. By pushing past these perceived boundaries, they found tasks that seemed difficult were, in fact, "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This continuous process of "believing in ourselves" has been a recent and significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## Skills Over Degrees: A Shifting Paradigm

The [[cultural_changes_and_societal_expectations | cultural changes]] in 2019 indicate a shift away from the traditional emphasis on Master's degrees towards valuing practical skills and a "practical approach to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Goami and Ab confidently believe that the skills acquired through YouTube, such as digital marketing and negotiation, provide them with enough practical experience to thrive in the world, even without a Master's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Their experience has already equipped them for a minimum package in a digital marketing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

They acknowledge that while Slayy Point as a channel might not become a "100 crore company," expanding their ventures in the digital space could lead to such success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. They believe that anyone with genuine interest can learn the necessary skills for content creation and business in the digital realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_youth_in_shaping_india | role of youth in shaping India]]'s entrepreneurial landscape and influencing [[cultural_changes_and_societal_expectations | societal expectations]] around success.

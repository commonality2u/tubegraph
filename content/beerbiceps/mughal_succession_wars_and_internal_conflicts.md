The history of the Mughal Empire was frequently marked by brutal power struggles and internal conflicts, particularly concerning succession to the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Unlike some monarchies, there was no established rule that the first son would automatically become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This often led to a stark choice: "the throne or the grave" for those who claimed power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Cruelty and Succession Under Jahangir (Salim)

Salim, later known as Jahangir, was noted for his cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>. His first son, Khusrau, was handsome and a warrior, liked by Emperor Akbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:10">[03:05:10]</a>. However, when Khusrau went against Salim, Salim tortured him, took out his eyes, and imprisoned him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:35">[03:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:53">[03:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:57">[03:05:57]</a>. To inflict greater pain, salt water was put into the empty eye sockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:45">[03:06:45]</a>. Khusrau, who was blinded and unable to speak due to torture, was later killed by his half-brother, Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:12">[03:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:15">[03:06:15]</a>.

## Shah Jahan's Ascent to Power

Shah Jahan himself ascended to power by eliminating 36 individuals, including Khusrau, who could claim the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:16">[03:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:22">[03:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:22">[03:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:22">[03:06:22]</a>.

## The Succession War of Shah Jahan's Sons

The "War of Succession" among Shah Jahan's four sons – Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Murad, and [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] – was a defining period of internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

*   **Dara Shikoh**: Shah Jahan's favored son, "the darling," was given control over fertile provinces like Punjab and the Ganges belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:55">[03:30:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:08">[03:31:08]</a>. He was known for his secular interests and discussions with Hindu, Christian, and Muslim scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:18">[03:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:21">[03:31:21]</a>. Dara Shikoh also wrote a book called "Mingling of Two Oceans," which was considered his biggest crime by Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:47">[03:30:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:54">[03:30:54]</a>. He eventually fled to Afghanistan and Iran before being caught by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, brought back to Delhi, put on trial under Sharia law, and beheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:39">[03:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:42">[03:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:02">[03:30:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:05">[03:30:05]</a>.
*   **Shah Shuja**: He was sent to Bengal and was described as a womanizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:25">[03:30:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:28">[03:30:28]</a>. One hypothesis suggests he was driven into Bengal by Aurangzeb's forces and eventually caught and eaten by cannibals in Arakan (modern-day Bangladesh/Burma) along with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Murad**: The youngest and "drunken" son, he was sent to Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:33">[03:30:33]</a>. Aurangzeb used Murad's ambition, feigning disinterest in the throne and claiming to be religious, to convince Murad to join him against Dara Shikoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:08">[03:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:08">[03:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:08">[03:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:38">[03:32:38]</a>. Murad had also committed crimes in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:21">[03:34:21]</a>. He eventually died from an opium overdose, or was hung after a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:57">[03:54:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:23">[03:55:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:28">[03:55:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:30">[03:55:30]</a>.
*   **[[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]**: Initially seen as a threat by Shah Jahan, [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] was sent to less fertile provinces like Deccan and the Kabul borders, limiting his financial and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:37">[03:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:42">[03:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:48">[03:30:48]</a>. Despite this, he strengthened his army by extracting money from the rich Deccan sultanates (Qutb Shahi and Adil Shahi), who had not paid tribute to the Mughal Empire for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:46">[03:31:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:49">[03:31:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:53">[03:31:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:56">[03:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He used religion as a tool to empower himself and rally support, often portraying Dara Shikoh as an "idolator" or "non-believer" due to his interfaith discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:54">[03:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:22">[03:32:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:25">[03:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:29">[03:32:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:34">[03:32:34]</a>.

### The Battle of Succession

[[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] and Murad's forces marched towards Agra, defeating Jaswant Singh Rathore, the powerful king of a Rajput kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:15">[03:35:15]</a>. Dara Shikoh, hesitant on the battlefield, wasted three days, allowing [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]'s army to rest and strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:38">[03:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:48">[03:35:48]</a>. [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] used religious rhetoric to inspire his soldiers, leading many orthodox Mansabdars to join his side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:11">[03:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:15">[03:36:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:23">[03:36:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>.

After a major battle where Dara Shikoh's army was massacred, he fled, eventually being caught and beheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:57">[03:35:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:05">[03:36:05]</a>. [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] himself was a skilled warrior and politician, earning his right to the throne through military prowess and strategic ruthlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:12">[03:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:19">[03:37:19]</a>.

## [[the_mughal_empires_rulers_and_their_cruel_tactics | Aurangzeb]]'s Consolidation of Power

Once on the throne, [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:52">[03:54:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:54">[03:54:54]</a>. He also imprisoned his own son, Muhammad Sultan, who had joined Shah Shuja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:05">[03:55:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>. Muhammad Sultan later died of depression at the age of 36 in Gwalior Fort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:14">[03:55:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:36">[03:55:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:40">[03:55:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:43">[03:55:43]</a>.

> "I don't blame [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] because Dara Shikoh, we praise him, we know him like because he was secular, he was so he was very good-looking and he was the darling of Shah Jahan." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:40">[03:30:40]</a>
> "I don't blame [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] because it was the legacy of the Mughal. It was the history that they have to kill whoever is claiming the throne." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:45">[03:28:45]</a>

Jahanara, [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]'s sister, who was very secular and loved Dara Shikoh, tried to persuade [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] to spare their brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:30">[03:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:32">[03:31:32]</a>. However, [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] rationalized his actions by citing Shah Jahan's own killings, including Khusrau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:07">[03:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:18">[03:32:18]</a>.

### The Mughal Army and Its Tactics

The Mughal army at its peak under [[the_relationship_between_aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] was incredibly powerful, consisting of 200,000 heavy-duty cavalrymen, 40,000 artillery men, and 100,000 foot soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:23">[03:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:23">[03:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:29">[03:56:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:31">[03:56:31]</a>. Their artillery men were trained by the Portuguese and used lightweight cannons that could be moved quickly on horseback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:33">[03:56:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:36">[03:56:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:39">[03:56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:43">[03:56:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:47">[03:56:47]</a>. They also used elephants given opium to become wild, with spiked iron balls tied to their trunks, to wreak havoc in enemy ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:29">[03:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:02">[03:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:06">[03:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:29">[03:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:49">[03:11:49]</a>.

The Mansabdars, who were military men granted land, maintained cavalry forces for the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. They were powerful, acting as "mini kings" in their areas, collecting taxes from cultivators, and instilling fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. Eighty percent of the Mughal Empire was under the rule of these military men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

The Mughal army was also very diverse, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkistanis, along with Indian Hindus and Marathas, though racial discrimination was present, with darker-skinned Indians often paid less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

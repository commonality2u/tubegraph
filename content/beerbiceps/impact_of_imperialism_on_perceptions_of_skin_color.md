The historical era of imperialism significantly shaped the perception of skin color, particularly the belief that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Context
During the imperialistic age, European countries expanded their territories, conquering regions across Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This period gave rise to the notion that white skin was superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This thought process has regrettably persisted in many Asian, African, and South American countries to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Societal Influence
The influence of imperialism on [[Public perception and polarization in India | public perception]] regarding skin color is evident in various aspects of life:
*   **Advertising** Companies historically promoted skin whitening with ads suggesting that fairness was necessary for better job opportunities or to find love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Beliefs** Even parents of today's generation grew up watching such ads and were influenced by imperialistic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Modern Perspective
It is crucial to understand that skin color is genetic and should not be altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The notion that fair skin is better than dark skin is unfounded and promotes racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In contemporary society, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It is important to foster self-love and confidence in one's natural skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

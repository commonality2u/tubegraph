The societal desire for "fair" skin, particularly among individuals with darker complexions, has its roots in imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon is often discussed in relation to regions like Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific, which were historically victims of the imperialistic age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Origins of the Perception
During the imperialistic era, European countries expanded their territories by conquering other parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It was during this period that the mentality emerged, suggesting "fair skin is better than dark skin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The imperial powers convinced the conquered populations that white skin was superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This thought process has unfortunately persisted in many Asian, African, and South American countries to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Lasting Societal Influence
This historical influence has manifested in various ways, including through advertising. Many individuals grew up seeing advertisements, such as those for "Fair & Lovely," which propagated the idea that fair skin was necessary for better job prospects or finding love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Even previous generations were influenced by these messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Challenging the Narrative
It is crucial to understand that skin color is genetic and individuals should not attempt to change it, but rather aim to make their natural skin color the best version of itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Practices like skin whitening using creams are discouraged due to their harmful long-term effects. These creams can contain substances such as hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil the quality of one's skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The notion that fair skin is superior to dark skin is a harmful and outdated belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In contemporary society, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Promoting the idea that dark skin is unattractive or that one should remove a suntan is akin to promoting racism, reflecting [[cultural_and_historical_misinformation_and_its_implications | cultural and historical misinformation and its implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Ultimately, self-acceptance and confidence are key to attractiveness, not external appearance dictated by historical prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

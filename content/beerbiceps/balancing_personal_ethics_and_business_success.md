Sva Shashi, recognized as one of India's prominent young entrepreneurs, attributes his significant success to a unique blend of personal ethical practices, particularly a nine-year commitment to celibacy and a disciplined yogic lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His journey highlights how deeply held personal values and spiritual practices can influence and even drive professional achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## An Entrepreneur Rooted in Yoga

Sva Shashi is the sole founder of a major wellness startup, which he prefers to call a "wellness ecosystem" rather than just a yoga startup, though yoga forms its authentic foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His company, which includes the aspirational women-focused brand Diva Yoga and the unisex, transformational mother brand SVA (meaning "all complete"), has attracted significant investment from high-profile individuals like Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Malika Arora, Shahid and Mira Kapoor, and Aishwarya Dhanush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Investors in his venture look not only at the business model but also at the founder himself, recognizing something unique about Sva Shashi as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. He believes that trust, love, respect, and strong ethics and values have been fundamental in building his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## The Five Precepts: A Foundation for Life and Business

Sva Shashi's life transformed at age 17 when he began an intensive yoga journey under a guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. After engaging in various *sadas* (disciplines) like prolonged silence and meditation, his teacher presented him with five core precepts to follow for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These precepts were commitments that, when adhered to, consistently led to personal and professional advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The five precepts are:
1.  **No Intoxication**: Abstinence from alcohol, smoking, and non-vegetarian food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Non-Violence**: Practicing non-violence through actions, thoughts, and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **No Stealing**: Avoiding both physical and mental theft, focusing on personal aspiration rather than coveting others' possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **No Lying**: Refraining from all forms of lying, even white lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  **Celibacy**: This was the most challenging precept, requiring no physical intimacy, no masturbation, and no ejaculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Initially, Sva Shashi followed these rules to prove his guru wrong, but after about 1.5 years (around age 19.5), they became a way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He continues to uphold them, seeing significant positive differences in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He emphasizes that one can operate a successful business without compromising on truthfulness, questioning why lying should be a necessity in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### The Power of Semen Retention and Intuition

A core benefit Sva Shashi attributes to semen retention is the channeling of energy upwards to the brain, which he believes opens up a "completely different dimension of creative thought process" and "right brain activation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This enhanced creative energy, he states, contributes to peak performance in any profession, whether corporate or creative, and even increases confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. He suggests that even a 21-day practice can yield noticeable benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

> "What does semen retention mean is largely taking that energy to your brain, taking it upwards instead of having it being released, you're taking it upwards to your head and which opens up a completely different dimension of creative thought process, right brain activation so on and so forth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>

Sva Shashi also notes a shift in his perception of attraction, moving beyond the physical to a deeper sense of connection and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. He acknowledges still feeling lust but is conscious of how to transmute it into compassion and love for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. He believes this practice makes one more magnetic, though he is unsure if it's a physical or energetic attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

His adherence to honesty, particularly "no lying," has led to what he describes as "manifestation" in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. He recounts instances where his truthful statements seemed to align with external events, leading his teacher to advise him not to speak predictions but instead to affirm that "whatever needs to happen for you will happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This demonstrates a strong link between his [[leadership_and_impact_of_spiritual_values_in_business | spiritual values]] and perceived influence on his reality.

Sva Shashi views intuition, or "Sixth Sense," as an innate human quality, accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. He believes his clean and [[Spirituality and Personal Relationships | spiritual lifestyle]], including adhering to the five precepts, enhances his intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. He does not consciously use his intuition for career gain, as true spirituality means "being in the present" and actively trying to be intuitive would break that principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. However, he notes that when intuition happens automatically, it guides him towards positive interactions and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. He shares personal anecdotes of manifesting significant goals, such as meeting Jennifer Lopez and having her invest in his company, after initially facing skepticism from his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

1.  **Be Authentic and True to Yourself**: It's crucial to stay authentic and not be overly influenced by external pressures or peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The first step towards any great achievement is taking that initial action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize Self-Care**: Both physical and mental self-care are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. He stresses the importance of loving oneself first to effectively care for and love others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. He suggests a mix of physical activities like gym and yoga, alongside mindful practices like breathing exercises, to foster self-belief and presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

Cultivating compassion through these practices naturally leads to a desire to spread positive messages and help others, as was the impetus for his yoga company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

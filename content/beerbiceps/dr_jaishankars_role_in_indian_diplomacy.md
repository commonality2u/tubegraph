Dr. S. Jaishankar serves as India's Minister of External Affairs, a role in which he has become a prominent figure, particularly in [[Geopolitical discussions related to India | geopolitical discussions related to India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. His tenure has been noted for "rewriting the country's branding on a global stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Public interest in [[Indias Foreign Policy | foreign policy]] has significantly grown, with Dr. Jaishankar often seen as the face of India's geopolitical stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Background and Diplomatic Approach

Dr. Jaishankar is a trained diplomat, having served for 45 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He is the second foreign minister in India's history to have previously been a career diplomat, the other being P.V. Narasimha Rao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. His initial diplomatic standard operating procedure (SOP) was to "keep it play it cool" and "don't make too many waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. However, he has transitioned into a "political face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, becoming popular for his "aggressive comebacks and responses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

He asserts a competitive nature, stating that while he is "very nice to people who are nice to me," it is "natural to push back" when he gets pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This "pushing back" is not personal; rather, it's a response when "the collective eye [of India] in some way is demeaned or attacked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. An example cited was the incident at the Indian High Commission in London where an individual attempted to pull down a flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

His long experience in diplomacy has honed his "pattern recognition," which he describes as an "instinct" rather than a spiritual sixth sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This allows him to anticipate diplomatic moves from other countries and foreign ministries, much like athletes study their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Influence of Prime Minister Modi

Dr. Jaishankar notes that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is "living in a different era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. He highlights PM Modi's "singular quality" of combining grand strategic ideas with meticulous attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This approach makes working with PM Modi both interesting and challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Navigating Geopolitical Challenges

The current global landscape presents significant challenges for India, including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and its consequences (energy, food, inflation, fertilizer shortages), border issues with China, and persistent terrorism from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Dr. Jaishankar emphasizes that foreign policy directly affects every Indian citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. His objective is to "get this foreign policy for you personally," which includes securing citizens abroad, assisting those in trouble, ensuring students can work, and facilitating visa processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Economic and Technological Dimensions of Foreign Policy

Dr. Jaishankar believes that economic strength is crucial in geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He advises youth and entrepreneurs to focus on creating employment, increasing exports, and helping the country become richer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. He states that competitiveness against other nations, not just China, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Initiatives like "Make in India," "Startup India," and "Gati Shakti" are essential for building infrastructure and attracting manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

He views foreign policy as a tool to "market India," "brand India," and "make India a magnet" for global business, ensuring investors perceive India as responsible and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

On the technological front, Dr. Jaishankar highlights the significance of the AI revolution and quantum computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. He sees technology, particularly semiconductors, as the "new oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, leading to discussions about trusted collaboration and supply chains among "like-minded" market economies and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

He also emphasizes the concept of a "global workplace," where Indian talent can find opportunities worldwide without necessarily leaving India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Mobility agreements, such as those signed with Australia, Austria, Germany, and the US, aim to facilitate these flows of skilled and talented Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. He reframes the "brain drain" discussion, suggesting that the world is a "membrane" where people can move in and out, recognizing that opportunities in India are increasingly competitive with those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

## Message to Youth and Thought Leaders

Dr. Jaishankar encourages young Indians to have "self-belief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>, stressing that the current era offers unparalleled opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. He links personal choices with national choices, asserting that "a good sound National Choice actually widens your personal choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

For YouTubers and early thought leaders, he states that leadership is not exclusive to the experienced or older generation, noting that "leadership can come from a young person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. He cites Prime Minister Modi as an example of a "Youth Icon" despite his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. He believes that different mediums are needed to engage diverse audiences in understanding the government's role and the global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

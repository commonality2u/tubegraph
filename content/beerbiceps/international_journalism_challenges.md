Payal Sharma, recognized as a leading voice in [[Journalism and media bias | Indian journalism]] and the face of India's geopolitical narrative, frequently navigates the complex landscape of international reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Her work, characterized by directness and bravery, involves addressing various challenges inherent in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Navigating Geopolitical Narratives and Bias

One significant challenge highlighted by Sharma is the prevailing bias in international media and academic settings. She recounts an experience at Oxford University where the atmosphere was "borderline hostile," with an audience holding strong preconceived notions about India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This hostility was exacerbated by "fellow Indians" who maligned the country on a global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

> "The people maligning India are your fellow Indians. You are negatively affecting the [[Media and soft power | soft power]] of your own motherland when you diss India on a global stage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>

Sharma notes a prevailing sentiment in such Western academic settings that to be considered a "true journalist," one must adopt an anti-India stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. She contrasts the perception of protests in India versus the West, pointing out double standards where cracking down on protests in Europe or America is deemed acceptable for "Law and Order," but similar actions in India would draw criticism as "Draconian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. This, she argues, stems from a mental dependence on Western validation by some Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

## Challenges of Reporting in Conflict Zones

Reporting from [[Middle East conflicts and perspectives | conflict zones]] presents unique [[Challenges and success in international career | challenges and success in international career]]. Sharma's experience in Israel during the Hamas attack highlighted the stark reality of war journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

> "There are two sets of people who enter a country: journalists and soldiers. Everyone else is leaving." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>

Unlike soldiers, journalists are not formally trained or equipped for combat zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. Sharma recalls the emotional toll, managing personal fears, and the intense, constantly updated environment of a newsroom during a developing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. She observed "raw human emotion" in the affected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>, and experienced firsthand the volatile nature of the situation, including sirens and the need to seek shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

### Resource Disparity
Sharma also points out the disparity in resources available to Indian journalists compared to their Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. She mentions instances where Indian reporters lacked basic funds for transportation, resorting to hitchhiking, driven solely by their passion for the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

## Media and Soft Power

A critical aspect of international journalism is its role in a nation's [[Media and soft power | soft power]]. Sharma emphasizes the need for India to build a "credible and impactful Global media presence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. She highlights the lack of an "Indian press presence index" in the global space, unlike major players such as Al Jazeera, BBC, RT, CNN, France 24, and Channel News Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

> "The American media has worked overtime to tell the world that this is for the global good. That is what soft power, that is what media presence gives a country." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>

Without such a presence, a country's intentions will be questioned, and its global reach limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. She argues that media narratives are crucial in shaping human viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a> and perceptions of a country, influencing everything from investor confidence to international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### Individual Content Creators vs. Institutions
Sharma acknowledges the rising influence of individual content creators in shaping narratives, due to their ability to build credibility and cut through the "paradox of plenty" in information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. However, she asserts that individuals with vision should aim to create institutions that "outlast them," to ensure a lasting impact on how their country is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

## Audience Engagement Challenges

Sharma also highlights the challenge of engaging diverse audiences, particularly women, in international news. She notes that globally, approximately 80% of the news audience is male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Despite covering topics like pay parity and abortion rights, which she feels strongly about, viewership drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. She encourages women to actively follow the news, as their engagement influences whether the industry takes their voice seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

The field of international journalism, as described by Payal Sharma, is fraught with [[challenges_and_struggles_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges and struggles in the entertainment industry]]. From navigating geopolitical biases and resource disparities in conflict zones to leveraging [[Media and soft power | soft power]] and engaging diverse audiences, it demands grit, strategic vision, and a deep understanding of global complexities.

The [[future_of_us_geopolitics_and_societal_issues | American political landscape]] is characterized by its influence on global narratives and internal challenges, particularly concerning upcoming presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

## Presidential Elections

The United States is projected to have an "old white man as their president" in the upcoming elections, a choice described as "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. The current candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, are both old and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. There is a perceived lack of diversity and youth representation among the candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.

### Political Calculations and Voter Support
Political calculations are heavily at play, particularly concerning voter demographics. For Joe Biden's party, Muslim American voters and the liberal youth are significant supporters. However, support from these groups is reportedly "shrinking because of this support to Israel in the Gaza War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

## Internal Challenges

The US faces several significant internal challenges:
*   **Immigration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>
*   **Abortion rights**: When half the population is not given rights over their own body to choose, it poses a problem for a country that calls itself "first world" or "developed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>.
*   **Gun violence**: This remains a major concern, with the strong gun lobby and the narrative that people need to be armed to be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.

## Global Influence and Soft Power

The US has successfully wielded [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | soft power]], with its value system and society still being seen as an ideal way of life globally, despite not being ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. However, expenditure on military vastly outweighs that on soft power initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

American media has historically influenced global perception. For example, when the US entered Iraq, it was termed a "global war on terrorism," unlike Russia's actions in Ukraine which were called an "invasion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This highlights how media presence allows a country to frame its intentions positively, ensuring its actions are not questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

Despite its current global standing, there's a view that the US is "sitting on the side lines" in the global "battle of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

### Conduct in Conflicts
The US approach to conflicts has been questioned, such as dropping aid packets on Gaza while simultaneously supplying weapons to Israelis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Economic and Technological Standing
The US maintains a lead in technology, particularly in chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>. Companies like Nvidia are described as "very big" and "very powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>.

## Future Leadership
From a broader perspective, there is a desire for a woman leader in the US, as female leaders are seen as governing their countries more effectively and less akin to "grown men fighting like kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>.

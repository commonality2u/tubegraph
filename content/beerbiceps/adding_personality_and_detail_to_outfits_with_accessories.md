Adding subtle details and well-chosen accessories can significantly elevate an outfit, separating a well-dressed man from an extremely well-dressed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This attention to detail applies to various elements of an ensemble, from shirts and shoes to smaller personal items.

## Shirt Details

Specific styling techniques for shirts can add significant personality and fun to an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

*   **Sleeve Rolling**
    An "awesome bicep sleeve roll" can add a unique flair to your shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Instead of simply rolling up in layers, try this method: grab the cuff, pull the sleeve up, and use the rest of the sleeve material to hold the cuff in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Many shirts, especially those manufactured around 2017, are designed to be rolled this way, often featuring a different inner pattern on the sleeve cuff that pops when rolled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Collar Styling**
    The collar is a crucial element as it's noticed in the face and neck region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   **Button-Down Collars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>: These shirts have buttons that keep the collar stiff and upright, adding personality, especially if the buttons contrast with the shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They ensure a neat appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When buying shirts, look for button-down options or those with an "extremely stiff and strong looking collar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For more information on shirt collars, see [[proper_shirt_collar_styling | Proper Shirt Collar Styling]].
    *   **Collar Stays**: For shirts with weaker collars, double-sided sticky tapes, known as collar stays, can be used to hold the collar upright and in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Tucking and Untucking**: The manufacturer's design indicates whether a shirt should be tucked in or left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Untucked**: If the side of the shirt has a curved, U-shape, it's designed to be left untucked outside your pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This is common with slim-fit shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Tucked In**: If the side of the shirt is straight, it should be tucked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Leaving straight-sided shirts untucked can look untidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Overall Neatness and Fit

Creases can ruin an otherwise gorgeous shirt, highlighting the importance of ironing clothes for a neat look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Ensure clothes are properly ironed and allowed to hang in the air for about 5 minutes after ironing to prevent new creases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Footwear and Belts

*   **Belt and Shoe Matching**: Always wear a belt with an outfit that requires one, and match its color to the color of your shoes for a neater appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. For more on choosing formal accessories, see [[choosing_formal_accessories_like_belts_shoes_and_watches | Choosing Formal Accessories Like Belts, Shoes, and Watches]].
*   **Shoe Cleanliness**: Dirty shoes, especially sneakers with white trims, draw negative attention and can ruin an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   **New Sneakers**: Avoid wearing new sneakers outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Reserve them for indoor occasions like parties, dates, or restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **White Sneakers**: Be particularly careful with white sneakers, wiping the white portions immediately after returning home, even from indoor wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **Suede Shoes**: For suede loafers, use a specialized suede spray (black for black shoes, plain for other colors) to maintain them and increase their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Shoe Selection for Occasions**:
    *   Casual: Loafers and sneakers are fashionable for casual outings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Everyday Wear: Boots and flip-flops are suitable for daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Important Occasions: Reserve new shoes for significant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Once a shoe is worn out or dirty, it should not be worn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Detailed Shoe Features**:
    *   **Tassels**: Tassels on shoes add personality, particularly suitable in India, pairing well with a white shirt and blue jeans to elevate the outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. However, they might limit versatility, as they are not typically worn with blazers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Suede Material**: A velvety suede material adds an elegant look to footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
    *   **Two-Tone Sneakers**: Sneakers with two colors offer more personality than monochrome options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   **White Laces**: For monochrome sneakers, such as a blue pair, adding white laces can elevate the outfit, making it look more casual and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Watches and Other Personal Accessories

*   **Watch Versatility**: Watches vary in versatility based on their strap, dial, and metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   **Least Versatile**: A very casual strap or a watch with limited color coordination (e.g., blue/white elements only) is less versatile, especially for nighttime wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   **Limited Versatility**: A black watch with a black dial and golden metal will suit darker-toned outfits and is barely suitable for daytime wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. A silver dial would improve its versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   **Moderate Versatility**: A white dial with a golden metal finish can be worn day or night, but it limits outfits to brighter tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   **Most Versatile**: The most versatile watches are those that can be worn with a wide range of outfits and at any time of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For more information, see [[watches_and_accessories_for_men | Watches and Accessories for Men]].
*   **Wallets and Card Holders**: These seemingly small items are noticed, especially in professional or dating scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Invest in a quality, stylish card holder for business cards and a new, stylish wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A wallet that balances formal and fun elements (e.g., a formal look with a slight, playful design) offers versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

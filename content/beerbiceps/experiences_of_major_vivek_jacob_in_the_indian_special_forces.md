[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Vivek Jacob]] is introduced as one of the most respected and battle-hardened Special Forces veterans India has produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This podcast marks a return to military-focused discussions for TRS, a niche that began with [[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. The conversation was a four-hour long recording, edited down to protect sensitive military information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Defining Special Forces

[[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process|Special Forces]] are described as the Commandos, or the highest efficiency part of the Indian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. These individuals live a very different life, engaging in multiple [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies|combat situations]] and transforming their human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. They are considered psychologically and physically a cut above the rest due to their extra supplemental training and the nature of their missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] emphasizes that [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process|Special Forces]] embody a unique [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality|mindset]] that develops over time through various physical, emotional, and psychological experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. The core idea is that everyone is uniquely special, and the [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality|Special Forces mindset]] is the realization of this inherent specialness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

In a military context, [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process|Special Forces]] represent a directed energy focused on national security, ensuring the country remains a safe place for people to live freely and creatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Their mandate is open-ended, meaning they can be tasked to do "anything, anywhere, anytime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This involves "creative destruction," where operations are unique masterpieces requiring an open-ended approach to situations as they unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations|Challenging Experiences]] in Combat

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] shares deeply personal [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies|combat experiences and survival strategies]]. He recalls a specific operation where he experienced extreme discomfort and anxiety for the first time in over a decade of service, an internal struggle that preceded a critical incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. During this operation, a teammate stepped on a mine and lost his leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. This catastrophic event in a hostile environment, far from base, tested his ability to maintain composure and make life-saving decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. In such moments of ultimate chaos, going into a "Flow State" — surrendering to the situation, accepting it, gaining awareness, and making critical choices — is essential for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

Another harrowing experience involved a young, highly capable soldier who suffered a head-on contact with an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. The enemy fired first, and the bullet hit the soldier's bulletproof helmet, causing it to collapse and crack his skull with such impact that his eye popped out and was hanging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>. Despite this horrific injury, the soldier instinctively killed the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>. Afterward, he spent months in a military hospital, losing all memory of his family and who he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. Eventually, some memories returned, but his face was disfigured, his engagement broke off, and he was reassigned to a simple administrative role, leaving him heartbroken and heavy-hearted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. Years later, he had recovered much of his former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.

### Life in Siachen Glacier
Siachen Glacier is described as an "extremely difficult place to survive and work in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The temperatures are so extreme that vegetables become "rock solids" and water thrown in the air freezes instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. Exposed skin burns, then loses sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. Beyond the cold, the environment is fraught with dangers like enemy raids and artillery shelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. [[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] recounts being very close to an artillery shell that hit a tree, turning the metal into "razor blades flying around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>. The sound of incoming shells is an "indescribable terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>.

## [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army|Encounters with Wildlife]]

In the course of their [[life_and_training_in_the_indian_army|work in the Army]], Special Forces personnel are constantly immersed in raw nature, where they physically and consciously merge with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

### The Leopard Encounter
[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] recounts an incident where he was on Sentry duty in complete darkness in a dangerous forested mountain area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. After about an hour and a half of waiting, he heard a noise very close by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. Switching on his night vision goggles, he found a leopard sitting less than a meter away, staring in the same direction he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. He aimed his weapon at the leopard, ready to fire if it attacked, but after four or five minutes, the leopard calmly walked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. He reflects that both he and the leopard were in alignment, peaceful, and in the "now of the moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. He suggests that because Special Forces soldiers often don't bathe for weeks, they smell like the forest, becoming a familiar scent to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

### The Bear Encounter
Bears, though they can look cute, are "extremely terrifying" and dangerous, capable of tearing a person apart with their strength, speed, and long, sharp claws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. A mother bear with cubs is considered the most dangerous animal in Indian forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] describes an incident where his team was deep in a forested mountain, approaching a target area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. He had earlier discovered a cave with a makeshift bed and animal droppings, which he later realized was a bear's den <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. His team settled on a narrow cliff ledge for surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Later that night, two large bears appeared below them, climbing directly towards their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. One bear stood up, smelt them, and then tried to find a way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. After failing to find an alternative path, one bear charged straight towards them, stopping just two meters away, roaring into [[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob's]] face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. With his weapon aimed, he was ready to fire, knowing a small bullet might not stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. His local SF teammate, behind him, flashed a red laser light into the bear's eyes, startling it and causing it to stumble backward and move off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. In such moments, all fear vanishes, and one operates purely in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.

## [[the_spiritual_and_psychological_aspects_of_military_life|Spiritual and Psychological Aspects of Military Life]]

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] believes that ultimately, "everything is spiritual" as all experiences originate from a higher consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:43">[01:36:43]</a>. Soldiers in combat are constantly at a barrier between life and death, where the chances of losing life or limb are always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>. To operate effectively, they must "cross their mind," letting go of duality (life/death, past/future) and focusing completely on the "now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. This Flow State merges spirit and matter, leading to a singular focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>.

### Intuition and Sixth Sense
Through prolonged exposure to intense situations, [[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] developed an intuition or "sixth sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>. He could feel when something was going to happen before it occurred, even hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>. This happens when one surrenders, letting go of past and future, and completely focuses on the present, allowing the "spiritual realm" to open up and information to pour into consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.

### The Concept of Karma
Regarding karma, [[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob's]] opinion is that it is real for those whose neural networks are formed to perceive cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. However, for "consciousnesses which have zoomed out" of that perception, karma is an illusion, like everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>. He highlights that perceptions of hero and villain are subjective, making karma a matter of perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.

### Near-Death Experience
[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] recounts a specific "impossible situation" where he was trapped on a cliff, holding onto grass, with a deep drop below, and an enemy looking at him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. In this moment, he had a "flash," a near-death experience where he saw his entire life in a flash, like a photo album with videos, experiencing time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This observation was entirely detached, without emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. He survived this situation, though the exact circumstances remain undisclosed, suggesting it was an instance where the "exact opposite of what should have happened is what happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. He believes this survival stemmed from an "alternative form of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>.

## Post-Military Endeavors: Soul of Steel

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Jacob]] is involved with "Soul of Steel," a program designed based on past military, mountaineering, and combat experiences, merging the best skill sets and mindsets from these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. Soul of Steel teaches mountain climbing, unarmed combat, emergency medical first response, survival skills, and navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>. Participants face real-world situations in the wild and high altitudes, which aims to unleash their self-realization and help them become better, more secure human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>. This initiative is focused on creating "human ability biomes" where individuals, from those with disabilities to Olympic athletes, can realize their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[major_vivek_jacobs_journey_in_the_indian_army|Major Vivek Jacob's]] journey provides profound insights into the extreme [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations|challenges and experiences of military operations]] and the deep [[the_spiritual_and_psychological_aspects_of_military_life|spiritual and psychological aspects of military life]]. His reflections emphasize surrendering to the moment, letting go of duality, and trusting intuition to navigate life-or-death situations. He believes his experiences can help others understand complex mental struggles and "snap out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>.

The historical period of imperialism significantly influenced global perceptions of skin color, particularly establishing the idea that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34">[00:34]</a>.

## Roots of the Perception
The imperialistic age saw European countries conquering vast regions, including Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16">[00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19">[00:19]</a>. During this time, the conquering European nations convinced the populations of these regions that white skin was superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57">[00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00">[01:00]</a>. This thought process, unfortunately, has persisted in many Asian, African, and South American countries to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08">[01:08]</a>. The notion that "fairness" is desirable is deeply rooted in this imperialistic legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>.

## Modern Manifestations
The enduring impact of this historical bias can be observed in media and societal attitudes. Many individuals grew up watching advertisements, such as those for "Fair & Lovely," which promoted the idea that fair skin was necessary for better job opportunities or to find love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43">[00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45">[00:45]</a>. Even previous generations were influenced by these messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53">[00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a>.

## Challenging the Narrative
Despite historical and ongoing societal pressures, it is important to understand that skin color is genetic and should not be altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>. Anyone promoting the idea that dark skin does not look good, or that suntans should be removed, is essentially promoting racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>.

Today, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53">[08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>. Confidence and self-acceptance are key to attractiveness, not external appearance or skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17">[08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19">[08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20">[08:20]</a>. Learning to be comfortable in one's own skin is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">[08:36]</a>.

Robert Kiyosaki, widely known for his book *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, has significantly influenced many individuals' personal finance journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Despite flunking out of school and struggling with writing, he became a global best-selling author, humbling him and instilling a sense of responsibility to continue his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His core philosophy revolves around money and challenging conventional wisdom about wealth.

## Understanding Money: Real vs. Fake

Kiyosaki asserts that traditional education fails to teach anything about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. He questions the notion that "the love of money is the root of all evil," arguing that the problem isn't money itself, but a lack of education and spirit regarding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He emphasizes a critical distinction:
*   **Fake Money**: This refers to fiat currency like the US dollar, rupee, or peso, which he calls "toilet paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. He states that governments print this money, causing poverty while making "crooks richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **Real Money**: This includes physical commodities like silver and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Key Investment Recommendations

Kiyosaki's primary investment advice is to shift away from working for fake money and instead acquire assets that generate income or hold inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

### Silver
Kiyosaki strongly recommends silver, calling it the "best investment in the world today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He notes that a silver round costs about $35 US, making it affordable for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He advises buying silver as an early warning signal before fiat currencies decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### Gold
Alongside silver, gold is considered "real money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. He stresses the importance of owning physical commodities, a practice common among the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Bitcoin
Kiyosaki invests in Bitcoin because of its "integrity," deriving from its blockchain technology, which he sees as holding its "shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. He views Bitcoin as having integrity, unlike the "fake" nature of national currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### Other Assets
He owns various assets, including real estate, cattle, and oil wells, highlighting that he does not work for "fake money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Prosperity, he argues, depends on jobs and the movement of industries, citing his own move to Arizona when Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) relocated there due to job creation and economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Education and Economic Systems

Kiyosaki's [[the_educational_systems_failure_to_teach_financial_literacy|criticism of the educational system]] is central to his financial philosophy. He believes schools are "the biggest criminals in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> for not teaching financial literacy, instead promoting a socialist or communist mindset that emphasizes equality and handouts over capitalism and wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He even wrote a book stating, "if you want to be rich, don't go to school" because they teach you to work for fake money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

He argues that the US is bankrupt and the biggest debtor nation, and that its leaders, whom he perceives as communists, are destroying the middle class to create a two-tier society of rich and poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This perspective informs his urgent advice to invest in real assets.

## Personal Philosophy and Discipline

Kiyosaki states that the goal of life is personal, and he measures his own life by "how much good" he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. His military background as a pilot in Vietnam taught him discipline, allowing him to "do what I have to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. He now fights with education with the same intensity he fought in war, for the "freedom of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. He emphasizes integrity, where one's words, heart, and actions are one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, and making money legally, ethically, and morally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

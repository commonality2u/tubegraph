Robert Kiyosaki, author of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, shares his perspective on the state of global [[geopolitics_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical tensions]] and their economic ramifications, drawing from his military background and financial expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## America's Economic Condition and Political Policies

Kiyosaki asserts that America is currently "bankrupt" and is the "biggest debtor nation in the world," with only Japan being more indebted per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. He characterizes President Joe Biden as a "criminal" and a "communist" due to his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

A key example cited is President Biden's decision to cut off the pipeline running from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which Kiyosaki, as an "oil guy," observes led to oil prices skyrocketing from $30 to $130 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. He views this as a deliberate act to "destroy the middle class" and create a society of only two classes: the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. In contrast, he considers Donald Trump a "capitalist" and a "good man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The "Fake Money" Problem
Kiyosaki warns against what he calls "fake money," referring to fiat currencies like the US dollar or Indian rupee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He argues that this fake money, which he likens to "toilet paper," is the root cause of poverty, making "crooks richer but the poor poorer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. He emphasizes that schools do not educate people about real money, deliberately keeping them ignorant of this truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. His main advice for financial security is to invest in real assets like silver and gold, and especially Bitcoin, which he values for its "integrity" through blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

## Geopolitical Landscape and Future Conflicts

Kiyosaki believes the world is currently "breaking in half," with major powers like Russia, [[chinas_geopolitical_challenges | China]], America, and Europe positioning themselves against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. He highlights India's critical position "in the middle" of these shifting alliances, especially with the recent BRICS meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

He strongly predicts that a "Third World War" is imminent, driven by conflicts in regions like Taiwan and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. The pursuit of semiconductors is identified as a key driver for [[current_geopolitical_scenarios_in_israel_and_china | China's interest in Taiwan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. He emphasizes the necessity for countries to "have strong people" and "defend this part of the world," citing India's own efforts in building warships as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Military Background

Kiyosaki's perspective is deeply influenced by his service as a pilot in Vietnam, where he was "trained to kill people" and lost many friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. He describes the bitterness of returning home to be "spitting on" and "hitting us with eggs" by hippies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This experience instilled in him discipline and a commitment to fighting for freedom, now through "education" rather than physical combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. He advocates for the freedom of speech and religion, rejecting racism and judging people by their actions rather than their words or race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Kiyosaki concludes by emphasizing the importance of "legal, ethical, moral" practices in acquiring wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

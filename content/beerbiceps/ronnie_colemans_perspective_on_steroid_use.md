[[Ronnie Colemans perspective on steroid use | Ronnie Coleman]] has always been transparent about his use of steroids, emphasizing that his approach prioritized health and was medically supervised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

## Medical Supervision and Health
Coleman states that everything he put into his body was doctor-prescribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. He received regular check-ups every four months to ensure his liver, kidneys, and heart were functioning correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. He never experienced problems with these organs because he was guided by a doctor throughout the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

Coleman stresses the importance of medical guidance for anyone considering steroid use:
> "This is what most people don't understand about using steroids that you need a doctor to write you a whole plan... You need to have your body checked out at least... at least six months, you know, don't go six months without checking it. I've never went six months without checking it, even now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>

He points out that amateur gym trainers may not have the necessary knowledge to safely guide someone using steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. Coleman himself conducted extensive research, including reading books, to ensure his usage was as safe as possible due to initial fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

## First Introduction to Steroids
Coleman first began using steroids around 1995 or 1996, at the age of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. He was initially "so afraid" to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. He received a lot of information and guidance from fellow bodybuilder Flex Wheeler, whom he approached directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

## Dosage and Appearance
Coleman asserts that he never took "massive amounts" of steroids, believing that doing so would have prevented him from being able to sit and discuss it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. He emphasizes that his body appeared healthy on stage, despite being large and muscular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. He specifically mentions his skin, noting that unlike some bodybuilders who developed pimples or red marks, his skin remained clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. This healthy appearance was a direct result of prioritizing his health and working with a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

Coleman confirmed that some other bodybuilders took larger dosages than he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. He also acknowledges that in both the US and India, it's a "culture" for gym trainers to provide steroids, even to teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. However, he generally maintains a non-judgmental stance, believing "to each his own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. His main concern is that these individuals often lack knowledge about the necessary accompanying treatments to protect organs like the liver, kidneys, and even hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Effects and Mindset
When he first started, Coleman's primary motivation for using steroids was to be competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. He did not immediately notice changes in his physique until he saw himself in magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

Coleman notes that the increase in testosterone did not lead to increased sexual activity; in fact, he was less sexually active when using steroids, especially during contest preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. His body wasn't used to the foreign substances, and his focus was entirely on winning the Olympia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. Sex was not perceived as something that would help him win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

## Steroid Detection in Others
Coleman claims he can identify if someone has used steroids by observing their physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. He points to certain characteristics, such as the shape and thickness of the shoulders, and overall muscle definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **Chris Hemsworth:** Coleman believes his physique, particularly the shoulders and thickness, is "not naturally achievable" and "not naturally attainable" for an actor who is not an athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cristiano Ronaldo:** His peak physique is considered achievable through hard work, dedication, and proper diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. His later physique, showing loss of size in his 30s, is seen as a natural progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Brock Lesnar:** Coleman perceives him as natural, noting a "lack of definition" in his shoulders, arms, and legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.
*   [[The Role of Aggression in Sports Success | Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]]: Coleman suspects he took "a little bit of something here and there" due to his defined and "cut up" physique, suggesting it's "very unlikely" to be natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.
*   **Mike Tyson:** Seen as a natural athlete, similar to Brock Lesnar, without evidence of steroid use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **John Cena:** Coleman believes he likely took "a little something" for short periods, perhaps two or three months out of the year, as he only needs to appear a certain way when taking off his clothes on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

The key indicators for Coleman are significant muscle definition around the shoulders and a lower body fat percentage than is typically natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

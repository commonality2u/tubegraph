The human soul is understood as the true identity of a being, separate from the physical body and its acquired characteristics like gender, profession, or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. The soul is seen as undergoing a journey through various "costumes" or bodies across lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Every soul has experienced both male and female bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.

## Karma and Sanskars
The concept of the soul is intrinsically linked to karma and sanskars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Karma:** All actions performed by a soul, visible or invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Success or ease in life is not solely due to "visible karma" (hard work in the current life) but also from "good karmas" done in previous lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Nothing is unfair in this world; everything is a consequence of karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Sanskars:** These are emotional patterns, habits, or inherent natures that the soul carries from past karmas into a new birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Examples include trust, doubt, criticism, or appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Even newborn twins can exhibit different sanskars on their first day, reflecting their past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The soul possesses all types of sanskars; it's the social conditioning of the current body that influences which ones become active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

## Destiny and Willpower
Destiny is pre-decided by one's own past karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. An astrological chart, prepared shortly after birth, acts as an "opening balance sheet" of the soul's accumulated karmas and sanskars from its journey through lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. It is a "probability manual," not a "reality manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

While destiny is influenced by past actions, individuals have the power to create their present karma and alter their future. By changing one's way of doing things and cultivating positive sanskars, the predicted outcomes can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This requires genuine effort and a shift in one's inner being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | Spiritual Progress]]
Meditation plays a crucial role in [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | spiritual progress]] by cleansing the mind and changing sanskars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. It helps souls to face the consequences of past karma without suffering, by changing their present response to situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. [[Spiritual Progress and Transformation | Spiritual progress]] is gauged not just by deep meditation experiences, but by how one's feelings and reactions change in day-to-day life and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

When a soul raises its vibration through practices like meditation, it radiates that energy into the collective consciousness of the planet, contributing to a broader energetic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This collective shift, driven by a "tipping point" of individuals, has the potential to overpower lower vibrational energy and transform the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## [[Intersection of spirituality and human experience | Spirituality and Human Experience]]
[[Intersection of spirituality and human experience | Spirituality]] is not a separate life but "the way to be in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. It means performing one's roles and responsibilities—whether in relationships or work—with a different, higher frame of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. The aim is to cultivate a "meditative way of doing your karma" (Karam Yogi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This involves being able to radiate good energy even when not receiving it from others, demonstrating spiritual stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.

All close relationships are karmic accounts from previous interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Souls continue to meet until karmic accounts are settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. [[Spirituality and Personal Relationships | Spirituality]] helps in cleaning uncomfortable karmic accounts and creating positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

## The World Cycle and The Soul's Home
The world undergoes a cyclical process, similar to daily cycles or seasons, with ages such as Golden Age, Silver Age, Copper Age, and Iron Age (Satyug, Treta Yug, Dwapar Yug, Kali Yug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The current period is described as the "peak of Iron Age" and a time of transition, where some souls are in deep sleep while others are beginning their [[exploring_personal_spiritual_journeys | awakening]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

The soul's ultimate home is the "soul world," a realm beyond the physical universe, where souls go to recharge and rest between lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. This is the place of origin, and souls have a faint memory of it, which is why people often express a desire to "go home" or achieve Muti (liberation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

The Divine Feminine, often depicted with multiple arms, symbolizes the "soul power" or Shakti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>, which every soul possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. It is meant to teach us to embody this power, rather than just worship it externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

## The Purpose of the Human Soul
The fundamental purpose of the human soul is to return to its original qualities, referred to as its 'dham' or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. These inherent qualities are:
*   Purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>
*   Peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>
*   Love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>
*   Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>
*   Wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>
*   Bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>

Teachers and prophets throughout history aimed to guide humanity back to these core qualities, emphasizing unity and shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. The goal is to bring these qualities into every action (karma) and become united with other souls by recognizing the shared essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

The purpose also involves the soul's transformation and contribution to the world's shift from the Iron Age back to the Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. By working on their sanskars and raising their vibration, individuals become instrumental in constructing this "new house," contributing to a collective shift rather than just a personal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Dandruff is a common scalp condition that can often be managed effectively at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding its types and causes is the first step towards successful treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[types_of_dandruff_and_their_symptoms | Types of Dandruff]]

There are two primary types of dandruff:
*   **Common Dandruff** This type is characterized by white flakes falling off your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While not physically harmful, it can be an embarrassing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Soric Dermatitis** This is a more severe form where white flakes are accompanied by intense itching in the scalp, hairline, and around the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It can also lead to boils, rashes, and significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If you suffer from soric dermatitis, it is crucial to consult a dermatologist instead of attempting home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

For most individuals, common dandruff can be cured by following four key secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How Dandruff Forms
Dandruff occurs because the scalp is a highly active environment, constantly producing and shedding skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If the scalp is also very oily, these dead skin cells can collect, mix with oil, and form the visible white flakes associated with dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Dandruff can be triggered by imbalances in hair care practices, specifically too little or too much oiling, shampooing, or conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Secret 1: [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | Hair Care Routine]] Management

Proper [[importance_of_hair_care_routine_for_dandruff | hair care]] is fundamental in managing dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **[[benefits_and_methods_of_hair_oiling | Oiling]]** If your scalp becomes too dry, it contributes to dead skin cell buildup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Oil acts like a fertilizer for your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Aim to oil your hair two to three times a week, but no more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Shampooing** For dandruff, shampoo your hair two or three times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. If you have dandruff, use an anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Avoid daily shampooing, as it strips the hair of its natural protective layer of oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **[[conditioner_use_and_pairing_with_shampoo | Conditioning]]** Conditioners are oil-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Overuse can make your scalp oily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Use a conditioner every time you use a mild shampoo, but maintain a balance â€“ neither overdo nor underdo it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Hair Product Usage** Excessive use of hair products like waxes, gels, clays, [[post_shower_hair_care_tips_including_serums_and_combing | serums]], or creams can cause dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When applying these products, ensure they do not come into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. They should only be applied to the body of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Secret 2: [[role_of_environment_in_managing_dandruff | Environment Care]]

Dandruff is an infection, so keeping your environment clean is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Pillowcases** Regularly clean your pillowcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. To eliminate dandruff-causing elements, soak your pillowcase in an antiseptic solution (antiseptic soap mixed with water) for at least 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Combs and Brushes** Apply the same cleaning method to your [[post_shower_hair_care_tips_including_serums_and_combing | combs]] and brushes that you regularly use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Headgear and Accessories** Clean all forms of headgear, such as caps, hats, and helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Any hair bands or hair clips that touch your scalp should also be cleaned thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Essentially, wash anything that comes into contact with your scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Secret 3: [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | Home Remedies]] and Skin pH

Understanding skin pH is key to effective home remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The skin's ideal pH is 5.5, meaning it is slightly acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This acidity creates a protective layer that helps kill harmful bacteria and infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For people with dandruff, the scalp's pH may be off, becoming less acidic than it should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Many anti-dandruff products work by correcting this pH balance, making the scalp more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This is where [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | natural home remedies]] come in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Any natural product that is slightly acidic can help cure dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Curd** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Lemon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar** For best results, use organic apple cider vinegar with "the mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Dilute it slightly with water and apply it to your scalp to cleanse it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Secret 4: [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos]]

If you suffer from dandruff, you should use an anti-dandruff shampoo at least once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, many anti-dandruff shampoos contain harmful chemicals like sulfates and parabens, which can damage hair quality long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Consider opting for [[natural_and_organic_solutions_for_dandruff_removal | organic anti-dandruff shampoos]] that are sulfate and paraben-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These shampoos help set the pH of your scalp correctly to cure dandruff while also maintaining the overall quality of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. An example mentioned is Wow Apple Cider Shampoos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. When [[choosing_the_right_shampoo_for_hair_health | choosing a shampoo]], look for those that are gentle and effective for both scalp health and hair quality.

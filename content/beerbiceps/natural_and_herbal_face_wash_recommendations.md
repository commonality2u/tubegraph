A proper skincare routine, applicable to all skin types including [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | oily skin]], dry skin, or regular skin, is crucial for maintaining skin health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Following a consistent routine can help prevent issues such as acne, blemishes, skin bumps, and irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Importance of Herbal Face Wash

While mild face washes were previously recommended due to limited options, the ideal choice is now a 100% herbal face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It is important to be cautious of big brands that claim to be ayurvedic, as many only contain ayurvedic ingredients rather than being entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. A truly herbal product should be derived from pure, natural sources.

Herbal face washes offer significant benefits beyond mere cleansing:
*   They provide substantial nutrition to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   The skin is capable of absorbing beneficial ingredients from these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Recommended Brands

For those seeking genuinely natural, ayurvedic, and herbal face washes, specific brands are recommended based on budget:

*   **Budget-Friendly:** Khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
*   **Premium Options:** K Aura and Forest Essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
    *   These three brands are known for producing 100% natural, ayurvedic, and herbal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The speaker personally uses a rose water face wash and an ayurvedic aloe vera face massage cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

The general face washing routine applies to all types of face washes, whether herbal, normal, or chemical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Preparation
It is preferable to wash your face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened, allowing for better cleaning and pore closure by the face wash routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Application
1.  Take a coin-sized portion of the face wash or gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
2.  Rub it between your hands before applying to the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
3.  Apply to the three main regions of the face using a circular motion:
    *   **Cheeks:** Rub for approximately 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck:** Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   **T-area (forehead, nose, and chin):** Rub in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

    *   **Circular Motion Benefits:** Increases blood flow, rejuvenates and rebuilds skin, promotes skin growth, and cleans dirt more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Technique:** Be gentle but firm with your strokes; avoid pressing too hard or too lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Post-Application
*   **Herbal Face Washes:** Allow the face wash to sit on your face for about one minute to let it work its "magic" before washing off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Water Temperature:** Wash your face with room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature, but not hot) water to avoid skin damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

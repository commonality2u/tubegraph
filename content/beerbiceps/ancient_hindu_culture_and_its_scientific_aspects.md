The term "mythology" can be a point of contention for many when discussing [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | Indian culture]] and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historically, imperialist Europeans labelled Indian culture and history as "myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While texts like the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana, and Shiv Purana are often categorized as mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, it is preferred to refer to them as [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_hindu_texts | Indian history and culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. There is a need for the youth and even older generations to learn more about this subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Loss of Historical Knowledge

Historically, many of India's historical records were lost, burned, or destroyed due to invasions over the last 1,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It is believed that India was even more knowledgeable 1,000 to 2,000 years ago than it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This loss of knowledge has created a significant disconnect between the rich civilizational knowledge of the past and contemporary behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For instance, while modern Indian cities struggle with planning, ancient cities of the Indus Saraswati civilization were among the most well-planned in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Approaching Ancient Texts with an Open Mind

When exploring ancient texts, it is crucial to maintain an open mind regarding the historicity of epics and legends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The focus should be on the lessons and scientific knowledge that can be gleaned from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Approaching these texts with political bias or a preconceived notion that such events were impossible in previous eras hinders a scientific outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. [[Hindu philosophy and deities | Indian religion]] has always encouraged curiosity, seeking to understand the world, oneself, and the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The Rig Veda and Upanishads encourage a spiritual journey and scientific inquiry, asking fundamental questions about existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Cosmology and the Multiverse

[[Hindu philosophy and deities | Hindu]] scriptures, particularly the Puranas, offer detailed cosmological descriptions, including the concept of a Multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Earth is not the only inhabited world; millions of inhabited worlds exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### The Cosmic Hierarchy
The Puranas present different versions of the supreme deity, often reflecting different "kalpas" (cosmic ages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Adi Purush**: According to the Purush Sukta in the Rig Veda, the entire creation emerges from the Adi Purush (First Person) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh**: These three form the Holy Trinity (Trimurti) of Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. In some Puranas, Vishnu is the Adi Purush, from whom Brahma emerges to create the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. In others, like the Shiv Purana, Shiva is supreme, emerging as a "lingam of fire" from which Brahma and Vishnu are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The stories differ because they refer to different kalpas, where creation might have unfolded differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Universal Cycle**: The universe's lifespan is tied to the breath of the Karoda Shai Vishnu, with millions of universes popping out every time he exhales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Brahma's lifespan for our universe is close to 311 trillion human years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Each day of Brahma is a "kalpa," during which creation and dissolution occur, with Brahma recreating everything daily with inputs from past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Aliens and Advanced Civilizations

The concept of "aliens" is explored through the depiction of "locas" (planes) and their inhabitants in ancient texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **14 Locas**: The Shrimat Bhagwat Purana describes 14 locas, with Earth being the middle level (Madhya Loka), seven below, and six above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The inhabitants of these different planets or galaxies are, by definition, aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Devas and Asuras**: These divine beings are depicted with advanced technology, such as "outer world technology," scientifically advanced civilizations, divine weapons (WMDs), and spaceships to travel between locas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Floating Cities**: The story of Tripurasura mentions three floating cities of asuras, which could be interpreted as spaceships or satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. These cities could only be destroyed when perfectly aligned, a scientific principle that required Lord Shiva to destroy them at a precise moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This event is celebrated as the "Da Deepavali" in Shiva temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The raids conducted by asuras from these floating cities on the devas' spaceships suggest "intergalactic wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Scientific Insights from Ancient Texts

### Vimanas and Advanced Technology
The ancient texts mention various types of "vimanas" (flying machines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.
*   **Pushpak Viman**: The Pushpak Viman, famously associated with Ravana (though he usurped it from his step-brother Kubera) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>, was one such machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **Other Flying Machines**: The Valmiki Ramayana mentions two other flying machines used to help Kubera escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. The Mahabharata also describes a flying machine used by King Shalva to attack Dwarka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   **Alien/Advanced Civilization Knowledge**: These vimanas were not created by humans but by advanced civilizations, such as Vishwakarma (architect of the devas) and Mayadanav (architect of the asuras), suggesting knowledge transfer from advanced beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Mercury Vortex**: Some vimanas were supposedly run on a "Mercury Vortex," indicating an advanced understanding of materials and propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. The *Vaimanika Shastra* describes different types and shapes of planes, some of which have been found to be aerodynamically stable when tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

### [[The role of Soma and other ancient substances in Indian culture | Soma]]
Soma is a crucial but often misunderstood substance in [[indian_temples_and_their_philosophical_and_cultural_meanings | Indian culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   **Not a Psychedelic**: While some theories suggest Soma was a psychedelic mushroom, descriptions in the Rig Veda imply it was an "invigorator" that provided an adrenaline rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: The ninth mandala of the Rig Veda is dedicated to Soma, describing its extraction from stalks of a creeper or shrub, its filtering through sheep's cloth, and its slightly bitter taste, often mixed with milk or curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Indra, a deity, drank large quantities of Soma before going to war, suggesting it was used for energy and focus rather than intoxication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. This invigorating property aligns with the "fight or flight" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Lost Identification**: The plant itself is believed to still exist, found in mountain regions like the Himalayas, Afghanistan, and Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Its exact identification has been lost over time, partly due to historical events like the partition of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Persian Parallels**: The Parsi community in Mumbai still practices a "Haoma ceremony" that is similar to the ancient Vedic Soma ceremony, involving juice extraction from a plant stock using a specific apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

### Geological and Climate Events
[[Historical and cultural evolution according to Hindu texts | Ancient Indian texts]] also reflect knowledge of significant geological and climatic events.
*   **Ice Ages and Migrations**: Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a scholar, argued in "The Arctic Home of The Vedas" that descriptions in Vedic verses, such as nights being six months long, indicate that the Vedic people or Rishis might have lived in the Arctic Zone when it had a more temperate climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Migrations would have occurred southwards as the ice age progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. This aligns with the "Out of Africa" theory of human origins, where populations moved into tropical zones like India and then further migrated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **Global Deluge**: The story of Manu and the Matsya Avatar (fish incarnation of Vishnu) is a direct parallel to worldwide flood mythologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. Vishnu warns Manu of a global deluge and instructs him to gather relevant plant and animal species and the Saptarishis (seven sages) to preserve knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This reflects the scientific reality of ice age melt downs causing rising sea levels and flooding coastal civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   **Submarine Volcanoes**: Scriptures mention a "mare-shaped fire under the water" (Badvamukha), which is stored to prevent destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This can be interpreted as a scientific description of submarine volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, which could cause catastrophic volcanic events, tsunamis, and earthquakes, leading to loss of sunlight and mass extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

### Dinosaurs
The concept of the "Sharab," a chimeric creature described as the ultimate predator in the food chain that could even eat lions and tigers, scientifically points towards dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. Furthermore, [[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | a clear carving of a Stegosaurus]] has been found on a temple wall at Angkor Wat (an 11th-century Hindu temple complex in Cambodia), predating the modern scientific discovery of dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## The Kali Yuga and the Messiah Concept (Kalki Avatar)

Many world mythologies share common features, including the great deluge and the concept of a returning messiah or savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.
*   **Kalki Avatar**: [[Hindu philosophy and deities | Hindu]] scriptures mention the return of Kalki as the last and final Avatar at the end of the Kali Yuga, ushering in a Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   **Cross-Cultural Parallels**: This concept is paralleled in Tibetan Buddhism with the "Kika Kings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>, Christianity with the coming back of the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, and Buddhism with the future Buddha, Maitreya Buddha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. Islam also has a concept of a returning prophet to guide civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:08:06]</a>. These shared concepts suggest either an ancient prophecy known to early humanity or a universal hope for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Indian Temples and their philosophical and cultural meanings | Indian culture]] and its so-called "mythology" offer a vast reservoir of knowledge, theories, and historical aspects that extend far beyond the well-known epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This includes profound insights into astrophysics (e.g., infinite universes), ancient human history, and spiritual studies about human purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>. The ancient scriptures encourage continuous inquiry and questioning, embodying a scientific outlook where true knowledge often lies in recognizing what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. Much of this deep history remains lost, either due to destruction by invasions (e.g., Nalanda University burning for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>) or because [[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | archaeological evidence]] has yet to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. Rediscovering and sharing this knowledge is crucial for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

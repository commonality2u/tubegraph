Dermatology, while sometimes trivialized, is a field that offers numerous procedures to address skin concerns and enhance appearance, ranging from basic skincare to advanced treatments [00:00:04]. Many individuals, including actors and influencers, seek dermatological help for both short-term fixes and long-term [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | skin health]] [00:50:05].

## Procedures and Their Effects

### Aesthetic Injections and Fillers

Actors and other individuals often seek treatments to maintain a youthful appearance and perfect facial contours, ensuring they look good for promotional events and public appearances [01:55:53].

*   **Biosimulatory Injections**
    *   **Description:** These injections, often containing [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | hyaluronic acid]], are injected under the skin [01:58:10].
    *   **Effects:** They do not change the face's contour but provide a dewy, stretched, and alabaster skin look [01:58:16]. They also stimulate the body's own collagen and elastin production, giving ground substance [01:58:28]. These are beneficial for [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] scars, providing a dewy look and improving stretched skin [01:58:21].
    *   **Pain:** Generally, these injections are not considered painful, especially when performed by an experienced practitioner using extra-fine needles [01:58:35].
*   **Lip and Chin Enhancements**
    *   **Description:** Fillers can be used to create a beautiful jawline or chin, offering an alternative to surgical implants [01:57:01].
    *   **Effects:** When done well, the results can last for approximately five years before needing further treatment [01:57:24].
    *   **Precautions:** It is crucial to have these procedures done by a qualified and trained dermatologist, as improper technique can lead to serious complications, including tissue death [02:04:46]. Young individuals sometimes undergo "lip jobs" in unregulated places, leading to poor aesthetic outcomes and severe health risks [02:04:32].

### Chemical Peels (Exfoliation)

Peels are a form of chemical [[the_importance_of_exfoliation_and_skincare_routines | exfoliation]] that gently loosen and remove the top dead layer of skin [01:07:17, 01:47:55]. They are common office procedures [01:54:01].

*   **Types and Effects:**
    *   **Very Superficial Peel:** This type removes the top dead layer of skin, making the skin appear brighter [01:48:13]. The patient can leave the clinic glowing within 20 minutes [01:48:54].
    *   **Superficial Peel:** May cause slight redness or irritation for a short period [01:48:26].
    *   **Medium-Depth Peel:** Can result in rougher or slower-shedding skin [01:48:37].
    *   **Deep Peel:** These peels literally shrink and remove a portion of the skin [01:48:43]. They require strict aftercare, such as being bandaged and staying indoors for about seven days [01:49:19]. Deep peels are generally not recommended for brown skin due to a high risk of severe pigmentation or scarring [01:49:50]. An example for brown skin is the TCA cross, applied only to [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] scars to flatten them by peeling the affected cone of skin [01:52:02].
*   **Application and Ingredients:** Peels are applied using techniques like paintbrushes or Q-tips, with some requiring sequential layering or segmental application for different skin areas [01:52:55]. Ingredients can include [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | vitamin C]], ferulic acid, kojic acid, azelaic acid, phytic acid, AHA (alpha hydroxy acid), BHA (beta hydroxy acid), salicylic acid, mandelic acid, or even [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | retinol]] [01:52:36].
*   **Overall Benefits:** Peels generally improve complexion, make skin brighter and cleaner, fade [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] scars, and blend out uneven tones [01:53:46].

### Isotretinoin (Accutane)

Isotretinoin, often known by brand names like Accutane or Roaccutane, is a popular and highly effective oral medication for [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] [01:39:23].

*   **Mechanism:** It is a derivative of [[use_of_skincare_products_such_as_retinol_and_hyaluronic_acid | vitamin A]] (a retinoid) that works by significantly drying out all glands in the body, including oil glands (sebaceous glands), tear glands, and mucous membranes [01:39:59]. This reduction in oil production is why it is so effective against [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] [01:41:00].
*   **Effectiveness:** It is highly effective for almost anyone with [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] [01:43:43].
*   **Side Effects and Precautions:**
    *   **Widespread Dryness:** Common side effects include dry lips, dry eyes, dry skin, and hair fall [01:40:40, 01:42:41].
    *   **Teratogenicity:** It is teratogenic, meaning it can cause severe birth defects if taken by a pregnant woman. Women must avoid conception while on this medication [01:40:24]. Recent studies suggest it is not teratogenic in men [01:40:29].
    *   **Internal Organ Effects:** It can be hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver) and derange lipid profiles [01:42:04]. Regular monitoring (e.g., blood tests for liver function and lipid profile) by a doctor is essential [01:46:37].
    *   **Long-term Use:** While short-term usage is generally accepted for severe cases, long-term perpetual use (e.g., 5mg daily) is a nascent area of study for its potential anti-aging effects [01:41:17, 01:46:15]. However, the doctor prefers to avoid prolonged use to prevent excessive drying and other side effects [01:40:47].
*   **Doctor's Perspective:** Isotretinoin is primarily used for severe, hereditary, or otherwise untreatable [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | cystic acne]] [01:41:01]. The aim is to achieve control and then potentially switch to other treatments like microneedling radiofrequency [01:41:35].

### Microneedling Radiofrequency (MNRF)

*   **Description:** This procedure uses tiny needles that penetrate the skin to deliver radiofrequency energy at specific depths, directly targeting and shrinking oil glands [01:41:36].
*   **Effects:** It permanently shrinks oil glands and, as a side effect, significantly treats [[causes_and_treatments_for_adult_acne | acne]] scars by stimulating collagen production [01:41:51, 01:41:59].
*   **Cost:** The cost varies significantly based on the clinic, city, doctor's expertise, and the quality of the machine used (e.g., Indian, Korean, Chinese, or US FDA-approved) [01:43:19]. A single session can range from ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, with a typical course involving at least four sessions [01:43:46].
*   **Precautions:** It is crucial to choose a qualified doctor and reputable clinic, as improper technique or reuse of disposable components can lead to complications like skin holes [01:45:12, 01:45:21, 01:45:34].

### Ultherapy (Highly Focused Ultrasound - HIFU)

*   **Description:** Ultherapy is a highly focused ultrasound treatment, considered the "gold standard" for skin tightening and lifting [01:59:00, 01:59:16].
*   **Effectiveness:** It is an amazing machine that provides significant skin tightening and lifting [01:59:18].
*   **Pain:** While patients continue to undergo the treatment, it is described as very painful [02:00:02].
*   **Frequency:** The doctor personally undergoes this treatment annually to maintain a tight jawline and healthy skin, suggesting that consistent application over years shows noticeable differences in aging compared to those who don't [02:00:19, 02:00:51].

## General Considerations for Dermatology Procedures

*   **Professional Expertise:** Given the trivialization and dilution of the dermatology field, it is paramount to seek a legitimate, qualified, and board-certified dermatologist for any skin concerns [00:05:05, 00:05:33]. Avoid "skin experts" or aesthetic physicians without proper credentials [00:05:11].
*   **Holistic Approach:** A great dermatologist will focus on understanding the underlying diagnosis first, starting with the simplest solutions like [[diet_and_lifestyle_factors_affecting_skin_health | diet and lifestyle changes]] (e.g., sleep, scalp hygiene) [00:06:08, 00:06:17, 00:06:21]. The goal is to make the patient independent of the dermatologist [00:06:38].
*   **Personalized Treatment:** Every individual's body and skin are different, meaning a treatment or food that suits one person may not suit another [00:09:59, 00:10:17]. Factors like genetics, regional background, gut microbiome, and age influence how the body reacts [00:11:00, 00:11:51, 01:31:16]. A detailed consultation is essential to understand individual history, parental skin conditions, travel history, and lifestyle [00:13:29, 01:14:06].
*   **Cost vs. Quality:** Do not compromise on quality for cost in medical procedures [01:44:00, 01:45:04]. Beware of "Diwali sales" or discounts in dermatology clinics, as quality and safety should be prioritized over bargains [01:44:38]. Reusing disposable components or using blunt needles can lead to severe complications [01:45:23, 01:45:34].
*   **Impact of Treatments:** Cosmetic treatments, when done well, can significantly boost confidence, improve quality of life, and even impact social interactions and career success [02:05:36, 02:06:03]. It's not about vanity but about addressing real psychological issues caused by skin concerns [02:06:03, 02:12:20].

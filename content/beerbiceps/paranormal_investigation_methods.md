Dr. Savio Fado, a demonologist and psychic, is part of a team that conducts [[paranormal_investigations_and_haunted_locations_in_india | paranormal investigations]] with a distinctly scientific approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:07">[06:04:07]</a>. The intention of these investigations is to help understand darkness to move towards light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. Fado, who initially began as a [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | skeptic]] himself, questions everything and does not readily believe claims of possession or haunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>.

## Approach to Paranormal Investigations

The team emphasizes a [[scientific_investigation_of_haunted_locations | scientific method]] for their investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:07">[06:04:07]</a>. They use devices that measure electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) and radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:34">[06:24:34]</a>. Their work aims to advance humanity's understanding of these phenomena, which currently exist in a "gray shaded area" with believers and [[skepticism_and_belief_in_spiritual_phenomena | skeptics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:06">[07:34:06]</a>.

### Initial Assessment: Scouting and Peripheral Audit
Before any full investigation, a rigorous initial assessment is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>:
*   **Scouting** involves physically visiting the location to check for any anomalies, whether spiritual or due to human interference (e.g., goons, drunkards, druggists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Audit** is a spiritual assessment to determine if a place is genuinely [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | haunted]] and worthy of investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Not every abandoned place or location where deaths occurred is necessarily [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | haunted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Psychic Abilities and Data Collection
Dr. Savio Fado utilizes his psychic abilities, developed over time, in his investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. He is particularly adept at [[telepathic_communication_and_psychometry | psychometry]], which involves touching objects and surfaces to read their history through nerve endings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. He interacts with elements like rocks and trees to gain answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. These psychic readings are then corroborated with factual evidence and the historical context of the place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

He documents his experiences, noting flashes of light, colors, faces, or voices he perceives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. The hope is to eventually translate this into technology, such as a laser that could read the history of a wall, potentially aiding in crime investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This belief stems from the idea that "spirituality is the science of the paranormal," suggesting deeper scientific principles within human physiology yet to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

### Personal Background and Skills
Savio's abilities stem from a developmental process, starting with handwriting analysis (graphology), face reading, and behavior analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. He also has expertise in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and hypnotherapy, which helped him realize "there is something more" beyond conventional understanding, leading him to extend his skills to non-living objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. NLP, for him, involves understanding how to program one's own brain or others', facilitating [[telepathic_communication_and_psychometry | telepathic communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

### Spiritual Hygiene and Protection
Investigators like Savio maintain a state of "spiritual hygiene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He remains in a meditative state 24/7, which increases the density of his aura, preventing entities from attaching to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He shuns off any sensed entities at the location itself, not allowing them to follow him home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The only physical cleanliness required after an investigation is personal hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Understanding Entities and Phenomena

### Demonic Possession and Exorcism
[[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | Demonic possession]] is defined as an "unwanted sickness" affecting the body, soul, or spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Demons are everywhere, and they latch onto vulnerability, feeding off negative emotions like fear, anger, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

[[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | Exorcism]] is a procedure to help with [[exorcism_and_spiritual_beings | demonic possession]], similar to mental health therapy but "one step beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The key is to diagnose and identify the specific demon, as each has its own weakness and requires a tailored approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Exorcisms do not have to be dramatic; they can be calm and relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. A person is vulnerable to attachment if there's a "gap in their aura" or if they project negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Types of Entities
*   **Demons**: These are described as "free radicals of energy" that gain a "spiritual memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. They have never "walked Earth" in a human form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. If this memory is negative, they form demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. More potent demons can manipulate memory, rendering a person's conscience "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Ghosts / Invisible Entities**: These are often human spirits who do not know they are dead, or they do know but choose not to cross over due to unresolved desires like concern for family, attachment to property, or a desire for revenge from an unnatural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. They need to gather energy (from EMF, light, air, water) to interact with the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. They are not always scary-looking; they can appear as normal humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. They are considered pests when they disturb humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.
*   **Poltergeists**: These are entities that can manipulate the physical medium (air, vibrations) to cause phenomena like throwing objects or shattering glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. They are not necessarily former humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

### Portals
Mirrors, especially those facing each other, can potentially act as "portals" or "doorways" to other dimensions by creating endless loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Savio possesses a large mirror that is kept covered because it can open a portal for "multiple entities" to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Natural formations (e.g., interacting elements like water bodies or trees) can also create portals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. Man-made arrangements of objects emitting high EMF (like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, refrigerators) in specific configurations can also form portals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### [[role_of_rituals_and_objects_in_paranormal_activities | Haunted Objects]]
Charged objects or those collected from [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | haunted]] locations can contain entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. These can be kept by investigators for study, almost like "demonic pets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

### Ouija Boards
Ouija boards primarily work on the "otor effect," where unconscious micro-muscle twitches of participants move the planchette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. Information often comes from the participants' own memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. However, they can also invite entities if the intention is present, making it "playing blind dates with evil entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>.

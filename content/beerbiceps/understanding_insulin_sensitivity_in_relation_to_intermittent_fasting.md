[[intermittent_fasting | Intermittent fasting]] (IF) is a dietary approach that emphasizes meal timings and significantly impacts the body's hormonal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. One of the key hormones affected by IF is insulin, specifically its sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## Insulin: An Anabolic Hormone
Insulin, alongside human growth hormone (HGH), is considered an anabolic hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. It plays a crucial role in increasing muscle mass and aiding in fat burning, leading to overall improvements in fitness levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Explaining Insulin Sensitivity
Insulin sensitivity refers to how efficiently your body uses insulin to produce changes, such as building muscle. To illustrate:
*   **Person A (More Insulin Sensitive)**: To gain 10 grams of muscle, Person A might require only 10 ml of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Person B (Less Insulin Sensitive)**: To achieve the same 10 grams of muscle, Person B would need 20 ml of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

Being less insulin sensitive means your body requires more insulin to create the same amount of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Conversely, a higher insulin sensitivity means your body works more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Generally, younger individuals tend to have higher insulin sensitivity, which naturally decreases with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Impact of Intermittent Fasting on Insulin Sensitivity
[[intermittent_fasting | Intermittent fasting]] has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. By adopting the [[intermittent_fasting | IF]] diet, you can improve your body's insulin sensitivity, thereby transforming it into a "fat burning machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

## Nutrient Repartitioning
The combined effect of increased HGH and improved insulin sensitivity helps with "nutrient repartitioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This means your body becomes more efficient at utilizing the food you consume, directing it towards building muscle mass rather than storing it as fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This enhanced efficiency makes your body operate in a "superhuman" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

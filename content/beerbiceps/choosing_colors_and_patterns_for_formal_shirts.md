When it comes to [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | formal dressing]] or office attire, your shirt choices significantly impact how you are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Choosing the right colors and patterns for shirts is a crucial aspect of presenting a well-dressed appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Types of Formal Dressing

It's important to understand that there are two main types of formal dressing, each with different [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:

*   **[[traditional_vs_modern_formal_wear | Traditional Formal Dressing]]**: This style has very strict [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules]] and is typical for old-school offices that offer little liberty in fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **[[traditional_vs_modern_formal_wear | Modern Formal]] / Business Casual**: This style allows for more flexibility and options, permitting slight deviations from traditional [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Modern formal [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules]] are generally applicable to newer offices or formal parties, but should only be followed if the specific environment allows it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Shirt Choices for Formal Dressing

### General Shirt Rules

Regardless of the formal style, some general guidelines apply to shirts:
*   Avoid half-sleeve shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Do not wear colors that are super saturated or have very high intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   For daytime situations, prioritize lighter colors, while darker colors are typically worn for nighttime events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Traditional Formal Shirts

For offices requiring strict adherence to traditional [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | rules]]:
*   **Colors**: Only white, shades of pink, or shades of blue are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In all cases, wear lighter shades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Patterns**: Avoid anything with too loud a pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. [[formal_dressing_rules_for_men | Traditional formal dressing]] emphasizes subtlety and sobriety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Modern Formal (Business Casual) Shirts

For environments that allow for more flexibility:
*   **Colors**: Lighter shades should still be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, for business casual, you can occasionally wear darker shades such as black, navy blue, brown, or shades of gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These are considered modern formal shirt colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Patterns**: While very loud [[rules_for_wearing_and_choosing_pattern_shirts | patterns]] are still not suitable, very subtle [[rules_for_wearing_and_choosing_pattern_shirts | patterns]] can be worn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The goal is to avoid anything too eye-catching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

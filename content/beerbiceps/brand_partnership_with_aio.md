The growth of the podcast is attributed to the enjoyment of the learning process and the ability to share new information with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## AIO Presents TRS
The partnership signifies TRS as the first self-produced Indian podcast to secure a brand partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While the name has changed to "AIO Presents TRS", the core elements of the podcast remain consistent:

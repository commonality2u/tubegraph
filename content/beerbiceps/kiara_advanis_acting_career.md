Kiara Advani, known for her acting career, also possesses a strong foundation in psychology, which she believes has profoundly influenced her approach to life and work.

## Educational Background and Career Choice

In her 11th and 12th grades, Kiara Advani opted for psychology and humanities, subjects that deeply interested her [00:05:06]. She excelled in psychology, topping her school in 12th grade with a 92% score [00:05:23], [00:05:27]. While she briefly considered pursuing further studies in psychology abroad as a "Plan B" [00:05:32], her overriding passion for acting meant "Plan A" was always her priority [00:05:43], [00:05:46].

Advani emphasizes the importance of subjects like life skills, people skills, and psychology being taught more extensively in school, believing they are relevant life skills [00:08:21], [00:08:27], [00:07:45]. Her spontaneous decision-making and tendency to follow her gut instincts have been crucial to her journey, even when decisions weren't immediately successful, as they served as valuable learning experiences [00:09:25], [00:09:41].

## Acting Style and Process

Kiara Advani describes herself as a very transparent person whose emotions are openly visible [00:02:37], [00:02:45]. She maintains that she is the same person in professional and personal settings [00:03:18], [00:03:34]. Her profession as an actor makes her a keen observer of life [00:01:13], [00:01:15].

She noted that portraying Preeti from *Kabir Singh* was an internalized process that made it difficult to "snap out of it" [00:06:10], [00:06:13]. Consequently, while filming *Good Newwz*, which was the "complete opposite" of Preeti, she had to consciously "up her energy and up her self" and learn the art of detachment [00:06:15], [00:06:28].

Advani believes that connecting with emotions on screen is crucial for audience connection, contrasting it with instances where she felt she merely "acted" rather than truly "felt" a scene [00:23:56], [00:24:27]. Her high emotional quotient means she can deeply empathize with others' feelings [00:11:48].

## Filmography and Industry Observations

Many people mistakenly believe Kiara Advani's debut Hindi film was *Dhoni*, but it was actually *Fugly* [00:16:44], [00:16:55]. She acknowledges that her performance in *Dhoni* was impactful, stating she "lit up the screen" [00:17:03], [00:17:06]. Her upcoming film, *Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2*, is set to release on May 20th [00:01:33], [00:01:37], [00:46:35].

Advani describes the career of content creation as challenging in the long term, stressing the importance of choosing a sustainable and enjoyable form [00:00:48], [00:00:56]. She notes that the audience has "lost interest in interviews which are just questions" and that podcasts, which allow for deeper conversations, are "here to stay" [00:16:24], [00:16:29].

### Working with Sushant Singh Rajput

Kiara Advani worked with Sushant Singh Rajput on the film *Dhoni* and describes their equation as "wonderful" [00:17:41], [00:17:46]. She remembers him as someone with a "very curious mind" and deeply passionate about his work [00:17:49], [00:18:59]. Sushant shared his extensive research for *Dhoni* with her to aid in her own preparation [00:19:11], [00:19:19]. She found him "so natural and so effortless" as an actor, highlighting his performances in *Dhoni* and *Kai Po Che* [00:20:08], [00:20:25]. Advani also noted that Sushant was a "bit of an insomniac," believing that the human body only truly needs two hours of sleep [00:19:21], [00:19:50].

## Personal Philosophy and Professional Outlook

Kiara Advani believes her humility stems from her upbringing, crediting her parents [00:21:16], [00:21:18]. She acknowledges that she is often very critical of herself as an actor [00:20:35], [00:20:44], but values her loyalty and strong foundation as a person [00:20:47].

Advani sees herself as a non-judgmental person, preferring to make observations rather than form rigid opinions, particularly about individuals upon first meeting them [00:33:07], [00:33:41]. This approach fosters an environment of curiosity and openness in conversations [00:34:03], [00:34:07].

She acknowledges that managing personal life alongside the demands of the acting profession can be challenging, particularly given the emotional depth required for her roles [00:11:05], [00:11:13], [00:22:34], [00:22:39]. Despite potential difficulties, she sees her emotional nature as a strength that ultimately enhances her performances [00:24:38], [00:24:42]. She also views the anxiety experienced before film releases as a form of excitement, a perspective that helps her to "refuel" and manage stress [00:14:37], [00:15:36].

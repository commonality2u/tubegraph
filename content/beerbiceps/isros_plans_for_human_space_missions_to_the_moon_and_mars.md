ISRO, under the leadership of Dr. S. Somnat, the chairperson, harbors ambitious plans for future human space missions, extending from the Moon to Mars, and even envisioning colonization of distant planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These plans are deeply intertwined with technological advancements, strategic investments, and a long-term vision for India's role in space exploration.

## Human Missions to the Moon

India aims to send human beings to the Moon by 2047 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This long-term vision includes setting up permanent lunar bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Phased Approach for Lunar Presence
The journey to the Moon is planned incrementally:
1.  **Gaganyaan Program**: The initial phase involves sending Indian astronauts to space, keeping them in orbit, and safely bringing them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
2.  **Bharatiya Space Station (Pariyan Station)**: Following Gaganyaan's success, ISRO plans to build a space station. This station would be a vast space where multiple individuals could live and work for months, conducting scientific, technical, or commercial experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This station will serve as a base for future Moon missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
3.  **Moon Bases**: The ultimate goal is to establish moon bases, potentially underground, to provide protection from radiation and micrometeor impacts in the absence of an atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. These bases would serve as critical launchpads for further deep-space exploration, allowing for the synthesis of fuels and construction of spacecraft at a much lower cost than launching from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

The motivation behind lunar colonization isn't a lack of space on Earth but to create a secondary base for deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Human Missions to Mars

Beyond the Moon, ISRO is actively discussing and planning for human missions to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Long-term Vision**: The current vision is to send humans to the Moon by 2047, with the next generation potentially taking on the challenge of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Strategic Importance**: India sees it as crucial to establish a presence on Mars, akin to setting up bases in Antarctica, to maintain its reputation and avoid being left behind in global space endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Challenges**:
    *   **Rocket Capability**: Current rockets are not massive enough for manned Mars missions, requiring significant scaling up of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
    *   **Travel Duration**: While current unmanned missions to Mars took around six months due to frugal approaches, more powerful rockets could reduce this to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. However, faster travel requires more fuel for deceleration, necessitating optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.
    *   **Cost**: A manned mission to the Moon alone could cost at least two lakh crores (approx. $24 billion USD) over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. Mars missions would require similar investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>. Dr. Somnat advocates for India, as an emerging economic power, to make these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
    *   **[[the_role_of_ai_and_robotics_in_space_exploration | Role of AI and Robotics]]**: While sending humans is currently more beneficial, there will come a point (potentially by the 2040s) when robots will become superior to humans for exploration in terms of functional capability, dexterity, and ability to do things in various situations, making robotic exploration potentially safer and more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

## Enabling Technologies and Frugality
ISRO emphasizes developing core technologies in-house and then transferring them to private industries for commercial exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:29">[02:43:29]</a>.

*   **Reusable Rockets**: Reusability is a key focus, significantly reducing launch costs and making large-scale operations feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. ISRO is developing rockets with methane fuel, similar to those used by Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Propulsion**: For long-term human exploration to distant planets, nuclear-fueled rockets are considered necessary. While development was halted after the Cold War, it has restarted in America, and ISRO acknowledges their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.
*   **Frugality**: ISRO maintains a culture of frugality and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that public money is used responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. This approach allows ISRO to achieve ambitious missions like [[the_chandrayaan_3_mission_and_its_scientific_findings | Chandrayaan 3]] at a fraction of the cost of other space agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

## Collaboration and Vision

ISRO is open to [[collaboration_opportunities_between_isro_and_entities_like_elon_musks_spacex | teaming up with Elon Musk]] and other space agencies, particularly on efforts that benefit all of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. This includes working with NASA on projects like the NISAR satellite, which involves sharing competence rather than direct technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.

The vision is for India to become an economically prosperous nation, which will naturally lead to greater investments in space exploration and contribute significantly to the global space economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. This includes fostering a thriving ecosystem of Indian space tech startups working on rockets, satellites, and various space-based services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>.

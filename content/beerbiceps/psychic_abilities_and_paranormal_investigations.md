Dr. Savio Fado is a demonologist and psychic who is part of the same crew as Sarjit Mohanty and Puja Vijay [01:07:07]. The intention behind their [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal]] work is to help people understand darkness so they can move towards the light [01:24:00]. Fado notes that engaging in [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal]] conversations or investigations can feel heavy [02:52:00].

## Dr. Savio Fado's Background and Approach

Savio Fado primarily functions as an exorcist within his team [03:11:00]. He developed his [[psychic abilities and paranormal investigations | psychic abilities]] over time, describing the process as developmental rather than magical [03:20:00]. He considers himself a skeptic, questioning everything that occurs during hauntings or exorcisms [03:30:00]. He does not readily believe claims of possession [03:38:00].

Fado employs various analytical skills in his work:
*   Handwriting analysis (graphology) [03:47:00]
*   Face reading [03:57:00]
*   Behavior analysis [03:57:00]
*   NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) [03:52:00]
*   Hypnotherapy [03:55:00]

These skills help him identify phenomena that are "beyond this" world [04:02:00]. He describes his approach as understanding human science rather than solely relying on gadgetry [11:05:00], stating, "spirituality is the science of the [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | Paranormal]]" [05:45:00].

### Development of Psychic Abilities
Fado's [[psychic abilities and paranormal investigations | psychic abilities]] developed slowly and steadily, rooted in keen observation [11:53:00]. He spent time observing people in parks, noting their attire, walk, and expressions to infer their state or recent activities [13:34:00]. This keen observation, combined with his knowledge of hypnosis and NLP, led him to sense a "something more" to human interaction and eventually to non-living objects [14:15:00].

His understanding of NLP involves programming the brain for [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | telepathic communication]], which he sees as a "soft telepathy" not yet covered by mainstream science [16:18:00]. He believes this non-verbal communication is about reading between the lines and using techniques like mirroring and anchoring [16:36:00].

### Role in Paranormal Investigations
Fado's specific role in [[paranormal_investigation_techniques | paranormal investigations]] involves:
*   **Scouting**: Physically visiting a location to check for anomalies, including spiritual disturbances, human interference, or dangerous elements like beasts or criminals [04:25:00].
*   **Peripheral Audit**: A spiritual assessment to determine if a place is truly haunted and worthy of investigation [04:56:00]. He notes that not every abandoned place is haunted, nor is every house where a death occurred [05:06:00].
*   **Psychometry**: The ability to touch objects or surfaces and "read" their history or information through nerve endings [08:18:00]. This information is then corroborated with facts and the history of the place [08:39:00]. For instance, during an investigation in Alibag, he and Puja Vijay both sensed a tunnel system by psychometry, which was later confirmed by a local [08:50:00]. Fado envisions future technology, like a laser, that could run along a wall and read its history to solve crime cases [09:34:00].

## Exorcism and Demonic Possession

Fado defines a "demon" as any unwanted sickness in the body, soul, or spirit [19:23:00]. He equates exorcising a demon to curing a cold with paracetamol [19:33:00]. He believes that diseases on a mental or spiritual level are also "demons" [19:50:00], a term rooted in ancient descriptions of afflictions like leprosy or convulsions [19:56:00].

### The Nature of Demons
Fado states that demons are "everywhere" [03:00:00] and are programmed similar to angels, each with a specific function [21:36:00]. Just as a demon of pancreatic cancer won't cause paralysis, a demon performing one brain function won't do something else [21:49:00]. The first step in exorcism is to diagnose or identify the specific demon, as each demon has its own weakness that can be targeted [22:09:00].

He emphasizes that exorcism is not always a dramatic, movie-like event [20:00:00]. It involves intricate spiritual procedures tailored to the individual, as every person and their mental illness are different [22:52:00]. An exorcist must first understand the person's history and symptoms before performing the exorcism [23:37:00]. During a manic phase, an exorcist would wait for the person to calm down before trying to help them find answers [25:48:00].

Demons feed off negative emotions like fear, anger, anxiety, depression, sadness, lust, greed, and gluttony [23:55:00]. If a demon spots one of these vulnerabilities, it will latch onto the individual [24:13:00]. Possessions occur when there is a "gap" in a person's aura, making them vulnerable to attachment [26:58:00]. Fado advises getting a demon exorcised as soon as possible [24:29:00].

### Fado's First Exorcism Experience
Fado's first firsthand experience with the [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | paranormal]] was witnessing his eldest brother perform a religious exorcism on a dear friend [17:58:00]. The possessed friend, a frail young man, could lift a sofa with one hand, vomited, and used filthy language, manifesting demonically [18:15:00]. This event convinced Fado that such things could really happen [18:40:00]. During the exorcism, the brother used scriptures from the Bible to minister to the spirit and exorcise the demon [24:35:00]. The process can take several hours, especially if the possessed person is unwilling to cooperate [24:55:00]. Fado himself is not afraid of demons, as fear is a negative emotion they feed upon [23:50:00].

### Challenging Exorcism Case
Fado recounted his most challenging exorcism case, which involved two boys who were acting "manically demonically possessed" [31:02:00]. They behaved synchronously: one would bang his head while the other pulled someone's hair; one tried to stab himself while the other attempted to stab someone else [34:39:00]. Both boys would enter a trance-like state and not remember their actions [32:50:00].

Through investigation, Fado discovered that the boys were half-brothers, sharing the same father but different mothers [37:02:00]. The father was having extramarital affairs and engaging in pedophilia [37:02:00]. The boys' manic phases synchronized with the father's indulgence in his illicit activities [38:20:00]. Fado found himself in a dilemma: treat the boys or address the environmental cause. The situation resolved when the father committed suicide, leading to the cessation of the boys' demonic manifestations [38:52:00]. Fado is unsure whether to credit his exorcism, the universe, the father's act, or the demon itself for the resolution [39:05:00].

## Types of Entities and Their Interaction

According to Fado, [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | weaker entities]] can attach to people, causing misfortune, accidents, or family discord without physical manifestation [41:30:00]. Many people don't realize they are afflicted [41:35:00].

*   **Ghosts**: Generally, [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | ghosts]] are departed human spirits [50:00:00]. Often, they do not realize they are dead and believe they are still normal humans, seeing living people as other normal individuals [01:00:05]. They only interact when their presence is acknowledged, as it requires energy [01:13:00]. Some [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | entities]] know they are [[paranormal_activities_and_notsupernatural_entities | ghosts]] but refuse to cross over due to unresolved desires, such as concern for living kin, attachment to property, or desire for revenge for an unnatural death [01:01:40]. They gather energy from sources like EMF, light, air, or plants [01:00:54].
*   **Demons**: Unlike [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | ghosts]], [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | demons]] are entities that have never "walked Earth" [01:18:00]. They are described as "free radicals of energy" that gain spiritual memory [01:19:36]. If this memory is positive, they form angels or spirit guides; if negative, they form [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | demons]] [01:19:47]. Some [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | demons]] are more powerful, causing illusions, hallucinations, or manipulating a sense of pride [01:51:00]. These more potent [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | demons]] can kill a person's conscience and manipulate their mind to believe evil is right, influencing actions like serial killings [01:54:00]. However, Fado stresses that individuals are ultimately responsible for their actions; it's easy to blame a demon, but the person committed the act [01:27:00].
*   **Poltergeists**: These entities can manipulate the physical medium, causing objects to move, shatter glass, or create other disturbances [01:26:00]. Not all [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | poltergeists]] were human; some are different kinds of beings from other realms [01:53:00].

### Portals and Haunted Objects
Fado states that all mirrors can potentially be portals or doorways to other dimensions [00:26:00]. Mirrors facing each other can create an endless loop, forming a passageway for out-worldly entities to enter this world [00:26:00]. This phenomenon is also recognized in Vastu and Feng Shui, which advise against placing mirrors opposite each other [00:26:00]. Fado keeps a large mirror at home that acts as a portal, which he keeps covered due to its ability to allow multiple entities to enter and exit [44:00:00].

Besides mirrors, natural occurrences can also create portals where three or four elements interact, such as water bodies or certain tree formations [01:03:00]. A house can also become a portal if objects emitting high EMF (like inverter batteries, Wi-Fi routers, or refrigerators) are placed in certain configurations, such as a triangle [01:03:00]. In such cases, people may visually see entities walking in and out of walls and doors [01:03:00].

Fado collects "haunted objects" or "charged objects" from cases or haunted locations, which he keeps at his home [00:33:00]. These objects can contain [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | entities]] [43:17:00].

### Ouija Boards
Ouija boards, while appearing occult, primarily operate on the "ideomotor effect," where subconscious micro-muscle movements of the users manipulate the planchette [01:21:40]. The information often comes from the users' own memories [01:22:25]. However, Fado cautions that a Ouija board can potentially invite an entity if the user's mind is manipulated by a demon or another entity that can access their memory [01:21:40]. It's like "playing blind dates with evil entities" [01:23:48]. Any form of spirit communication, be it a Ouija board, gadgets, or EVP (electronic voice phenomena), is valid if it provides a response to a given stimulus [01:27:48].

## Interacting with Entities
When approaching an entity, Fado emphasizes that empathy is not always the direct method, akin to how one might not show overt sympathy to an accused criminal to get them to break down [01:14:03]. However, acknowledging their presence is key, as they will only expend energy on those who recognize them [01:13:00].

He describes [[interaction_with_spirits_and_entities | interacting with entities]] as a form of telepathy [01:33:00]. Since [[paranormal_activities_and_supernatural_entities | ghosts]] lack physical bodies, they cannot see or hear verbally, so communication occurs through vibrations and telepathic projection [01:33:00]. This involves thinking thoughts out loud and manipulating mediums like light, air, water, or fire [01:33:00].

Fado protects himself from entities by performing a "cleansing" at the location immediately after a case, shunning off entities and not allowing them to follow him home [01:28:38]. He maintains a constant meditative state to increase the density of his aura, which helps drive off other entities [01:29:31]. No entity has ever come home with him, apart from the collected haunted objects [01:29:58].

His most difficult entity encounter involved a spirit that had murdered a whole family and was physically able to restrain him by causing tree branches to block his path [01:11:00]. He stated that had he shown fear, the entity could have tried to possess him [01:14:49]. This spirit was powerful due to years of staying put and accumulating energy [01:16:11], possibly feeding off rituals performed in the area [01:17:17].

He recalled an instance where an entity manipulated his perception of sound during an investigation, making him hear voices that weren't there to deter him from going to a certain location [01:20:05].

Fado confirms that the police have consulted him to solve cases [01:06:05], including one where he helped a police officer solve his own son's murder [01:06:23].

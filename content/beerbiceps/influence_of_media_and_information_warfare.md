Modern security and [[geopolitical_strategies_and_narratives | geopolitical strategies and narratives]] are deeply intertwined with the influence of media and information warfare. The scope of "security" has expanded beyond traditional military and political aspects to include factors like demography, migrations, and water shortages, all of which can be influenced by narratives [00:14:38].

## Intelligence Gathering and Open Sources

Intelligence is defined as gathering information about an adversary, including their plans, intentions, abilities, and likely moves [00:05:32]. While "hard intelligence" is based on documented proof, audio, imagery, or direct evidence [00:10:35], a significant portion of information (around 90%) comes from "open sources" [00:17:41]. This includes publicly available information, even from platforms like Google Maps [00:18:07] and social media [00:18:15]. The "art" lies in combining this publicly available information with additional intelligence to gain a strategic advantage [00:17:51].

## Media as a Weapon of Influence

Social media is viewed not only as a tool for information collection but also as a "weapon of influence" [00:18:26]. It can be used to "psychologically impact" and "twist the story around" [00:18:31]. The widespread nature of platforms like WhatsApp means it is difficult to discern true from false information [00:18:40]. It is expected that intelligence agencies from countries like China and Pakistan are actively involved in [[media_representation_and_geopolitical_tensions_between_india_and_china | twisting narratives on social media]] against India [00:18:54].

### Building and Countering Narratives

States actively build narratives, which can be long-term (e.g., promoting a sense of superiority or depicting others as inferior) [00:44:00] or short-term for specific purposes [00:45:19].

Examples of narrative building:
*   **Portrayal of India:** Historically, India was often portrayed by Western narratives as a "land of snake charmers," suggesting inferiority and a lack of cultural or intellectual heritage [00:44:29].
*   **The Iraq War:** The narrative that Saddam Hussein possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) and harbored Al-Qaeda was used to justify the invasion of Iraq [00:45:25]. This was described as "manufactured intelligence" used to "manufacture a story" and spread it globally before an attack [00:45:49]. The underlying intention, however, was attributed to control over oil resources and preventing financial shifts away from the dollar [00:46:10].
*   **Portrayal of Dictators:** Shows like "How to Be a Dictator" on Netflix are seen as part of a "long-term narrative" designed to portray certain leaders in an "evil light" to serve Western interests [00:50:01]. This constant feeding of a "certain narrative" can become the public's "truth" [00:50:52].
*   **Controlling Population:** Discussions since 1974 have revolved around controlling global population growth, with a potential outcome being the control of resources like food [00:55:03]. This can involve "genetically modified food" and seeds, which are supplied by American companies, granting them control over global agriculture [00:57:17].

### Critiques of Mainstream Media

There is a suggestion that general audiences should "stop watching the news" [00:48:49], as mainstream media often presents a partial truth or narratives driven by specific agendas [00:48:24]. Podcasts are offered as an alternative source of information [00:48:59].

### Geopolitical Narratives and International Relations

Western media narratives often depict countries like China and Russia as being on the brink of collapse or civil war [00:39:39]. However, this perspective may underestimate the "resilience" of these nations, citing Russia's historical strength against invaders like Hitler in St. Petersburg [00:42:36] and China's historical acceptance of autocratic rule [00:41:40]. These narratives, when originating from the West, are often seen as a form of [[role_of_media_and_public_perception_in_politics | propaganda]] [00:43:20].

In the context of the Ukraine conflict, the world has largely remained "neutral" outside of Western lobbies, indicating a struggle for global consensus on who the "hero or the villain" is [00:52:34]. This has led to shifts in global trade away from the dollar, demonstrating a decline in a superpower's "super power abilities" [00:53:24].

## Influence on National Security

The ability to build and counter narratives is crucial for national security. India's current government has been perceived as giving India a "tiger's branding on the world stage," making other countries "think twice or thrice" before acting against it [01:00:15]. This is attributed to visible efforts in delivering on promises for common citizens, strengthening international relations [01:02:22], and taking strong actions like the Balakot airstrike, which served as a "message" rather than just a military operation [01:03:00]. This assertiveness in reaction, unlike the response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, instills "self pride" and "confidence" nationally and internationally [01:03:57]. This improved security is a combination of both a strong government and well-equipped intelligence agencies and military [01:05:30].

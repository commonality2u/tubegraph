Priyanka Chopra's journey and persona have been significantly shaped by her upbringing and the values instilled by her family, particularly her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Her background as someone from a "very small town" in Bareli and Jamshedpur, with her father from Punjab, underscores her rise in the entertainment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Foundations of Confidence and Dreams

Chopra attributes her "magnetism" and confidence to lessons learned from her mother and other strong family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They taught her that circumstances don't matter as much as the size of one's dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. She admits to having "really large dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and her ambition continues to give her purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. She pursues excellence in everything she does, not liking to do anything "less than perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Discipline and Preparation

Both of Chopra's parents were physicians in the Army, a background that instilled a strong sense of discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This discipline, to her, means being prepared, training, and learning, and giving "120%" to any job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. She learned that in the military, even one mistake can have a significant "butterfly effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, which translated into her meticulous approach to her career. This commitment to preparation was evident early in her career when a choreographer's criticism led her to intensively study Kathak dance for six hours a day before returning to a film set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Lessons in Relationships and Equality

Chopra highlights the importance of honesty in all [[lessons_from_priyanka_chopras_personal_and_professional_relationships | relationships]], whether with friends, family, or romantic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. She believes in being real about one's feelings and having the courage to express them, rather than pretending to maintain a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Her parents' relationship served as a powerful model, characterized by "equality" and mutual respect for each other's opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. She was raised in an environment where her mother's opinion was as important as her father's, and decisions were made together, fostering an "extremely healthy marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Parental Support

Chopra's father taught her to "smile through everything" and not to be afraid of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. He emphasized that what defines a person is their response to failure, urging her to find the courage to do things differently after making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Her parents consistently supported her [[priyanka_chopras_career_journey_and_ambitions | career journey]] and aspirations, ensuring she never experienced "what if" moments in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. They encouraged her to always have the "courage of conviction," even joking that if she "killed someone," they would help, but would also take her to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This unique perspective fostered a strong sense of trust and accountability.

During personal challenges, including a period where she struggled with what she felt was depression after her father's passing and moving to a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, she learned the importance of seeking support. She initially tried to keep herself busy with work, which she later realized was a way of "running away" from her issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Instead, she chose to rely on friends and actively sought out people who cared about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. She advises others struggling with [[priyanka_chopras_approach_to_mental_health | mental health issues]] not to keep it to themselves and to find someone to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Her mother's fiercely protective nature and dedication to fulfilling her daughter's dreams also mirrored a central theme in her film, *The Sky Is Pink*, where a mother protects her daughter's unique perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, reflecting the idea of "don't let anyone define to you what your sky should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Chopra's approach to facing challenges is to maintain "Grace Under Fire," finding her own solutions rather than playing the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

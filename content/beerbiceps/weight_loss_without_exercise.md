Losing weight can primarily be achieved through dietary adjustments, with diet accounting for about 70-80% of your overall [[exercise_diet_and_lifestyle_advice_for_weight_loss_and_general_health | weight loss journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This guide focuses on the [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | diet side of weight loss]], offering an ultimate guide to understanding how food choices impact your weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Core Principles of Weight Loss Dieting

Weight loss is less about rigid, fixed meal plans and more about understanding food science and making consistently better food decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For long-term success, a diet plan must be enjoyable and incorporate aspects of fun, especially given the prevalence of delicious and junk food in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The fundamental key to losing weight is adhering to the [[caloric_deficit_and_weight_loss | caloric theory]]: your calories consumed must be less than your calories expended daily until you reach your target weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The Weight Loss Scale: Levels of Diet Protocols

The speed of your [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] is determined by the intensity of your dietary approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This "weight loss scale" presents different levels, from easier, slower methods to more challenging, rapid ones. Each higher level incorporates the rules of the preceding levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Level 1: Minimizing Desserts

The initial step in your [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | weight loss journey]] is to cut out or minimize desserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Desserts are problematic because they contain:
*   **Sugar:** An addictive substance that triggers similar brain reactions to cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Refined Carbohydrates:** Such as *maida*, which are not beneficial for your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **High Fat Content:** Fat is often added for flavor, making desserts highly palatable and calorie-dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Level 2: Eliminating Vegetarian Junk Food

Beyond desserts, the next step is to cut out vegetarian junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Unlike non-vegetarian junk food, which might offer some protein, vegetarian junk food (like *chira*, *farsan*, *bhaji*, *sev puri*, *pani puri*) primarily consists of refined, simple carbohydrates and unhealthy fats, offering minimal protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. If you are vegetarian and eat out, opt for paneer-based dishes, which provide some protein and are a better alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Level 3: Making Better Carbohydrate Choices

This level involves replacing simple (high Glycemic Index/GI) carbohydrates with complex (low GI) carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Complex carbs are harder for your body to digest, keeping you feeling fuller (satiated) for longer periods and leading to fewer overall calorie consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

*   **Replace:** White rice, *maida* (white flour), white bread, potatoes.
*   **With:** Brown rice, oats, whole wheat products, sweet potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

By making these changes, you'll experience higher energy levels, prolonged satiety, and positive changes in body composition due to reduced calorie intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Levels 1-3 form a protocol that can be followed for life to maintain a healthy weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Level 4: Indian Paleo Diet

This level introduces specific diet protocols, starting with Indian Paleo. It's a low-carb diet that avoids all standard carbohydrate sources like rice, potatoes, wheat, and other grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It includes meat, vegetables, fruits, and, uniquely for Indian Paleo, legumes like *dals* (which typically contain some carbohydrates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. A typical day on Indian Paleo might involve fruit for breakfast, followed by veggies and other non-carb foods for the rest of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Level 5: The [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]]

The [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]] (Keto) is a highly effective, very low-carb diet for [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. In a keto diet, net carbohydrates are restricted to no more than 20 grams per day, including carbs from vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Strict keto often limits vegetable choices to green leafy vegetables, excluding higher-carb options like carrots or beetroot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Following a keto diet can lead to very rapid [[tanmay_bhats_weight_loss_journey | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Level 6: Intermittent Fasting

For those who prefer not to follow a low-carb diet, Intermittent Fasting (IF) is another effective protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting.

### Level 7: Combining Intermittent Fasting and [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]]

This advanced level combines Intermittent Fasting with the [[ketogenic_diet_and_exercise | Ketogenic Diet]] to significantly increase the speed of [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It is a completely safe combination that can result in rapid weight loss, potentially up to 5 kgs in one week, provided the rules of both protocols are strictly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, it is a very difficult protocol to adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Level 8: Saltless Protocol (Unhealthy)

>[!CAUTION]
> This protocol is considered unhealthy and is *not* recommended for general [[diet_and_exercise_for_overall_body_health | health]] or long-term [[diet_strategies_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. It is primarily used by individuals for temporary aesthetic purposes, such as photo shoots or specific functions, to achieve an extremely lean appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

This extreme method involves going saltless for one or two days, often combined with a diuretic pill and a potassium supplement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. The lack of salt and the diuretic drain the body of all water, including "water weight," resulting in "paper-thin skin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This process leads to partial dehydration and is considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

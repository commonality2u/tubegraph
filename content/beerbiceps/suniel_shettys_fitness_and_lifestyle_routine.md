Suniel Shetty has undergone a period of reinvention, focusing on his health and wellness. He aims to make his current work meaningful and enjoyable, especially as he embarks on what he calls a "launch as a senior citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. He believes that the only way to connect with the youth is by discussing health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. For him, health has been a consistent factor throughout his life, regardless of success, failure, or movie projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. The pandemic further emphasized the importance of focusing on one's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Daily Routine and Training

Suniel Shetty's fitness routine is deeply integrated into his lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. He emphasizes consistency and specific habits:
*   **Sleep Schedule**: He adheres to an "early to bed, early to rise" philosophy, ensuring he is up by 4-6 AM and asleep by 10-10:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. He prioritizes this routine, catching up on sleep during the week if he's late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Exercise**: He trains early in the morning for 45 minutes to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Focus**: He uses his gym time or gardening time for "me time," where he forgets everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.

He attributes his current appearance and fitness to these consistent habits, noting that age is just a number and that anyone can achieve similar results through simple practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Dietary Habits

Suniel Shetty highlights that diet accounts for 80% of his fitness, with training and habits making up the remaining 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. His key dietary principles include:
*   **Clean and Home-Cooked Food**: He primarily eats simple, home-cooked food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. He avoids ordering from outside because he is unaware of the ingredients and preservatives used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **Calorie and Oil Control**: He counts his calories and monitors his oil intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "White" Foods**: He stays away from white foods such as milk, white rice, salt, and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **Supplements**: He does not generally use supplements or protein counts, preferring natural supplementation based on individual body requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. He consults a nutritionist to address any deficiencies found through blood routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Food as Life**: His most important health tip is "food is life" and "what you eat is what you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:48]</a>.

## Views on Aging and Physicality

Suniel Shetty believes that every stage of life is beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. While growing older means slowing down as an action hero, it also brings wisdom and smarter ways to present oneself on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. He views his aging as being "at the right time" due to increased knowledge about skin wellness, gut health, and the resurgence of traditional practices like Ayurveda and Yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

He sets specific fitness goals for himself at different ages:
*   **At 50**: He aimed to be the "fittest 50 ever" and achieved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **At 60**: He set a goal to have a "six-pack at 60," which he managed decently through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

He encourages young people to focus on health and wellness, using his own appearance as an example to inspire them to encourage their fathers to be active and healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## The Power of Manifestation and Early Struggles

The concept of "the power of manifestation" involves thinking about a particular goal and then working towards its achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. An early experience with this power involved a personal challenge: upon arriving in Bombay (Mumbai), the individual vowed not to see any beach until they secured an audition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For a week, this discipline was maintained, even hiding in an auto-rickshaw to avoid glimpsing the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Only after receiving the first contract as a radio presenter did they go to the beach, opening their arms in a symbolic declaration of "I have arrived, I have conquered this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This highlights the importance of combining mental discipline with action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

During their early twenties, a period characterized by intense "hustle," the individual experienced personal suffering, including not talking to parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This period involved an extreme work schedule, simultaneously doing a radio show, a reality TV serial, and MTV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Sleep was often limited to three hours a day, taken in the car while a driver navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This reflects the intense dedication and sacrifice required in their [[vikrams_personal_and_professional_journey | personal and professional journey]] during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Transformative Role of Failure

[[Personal Journeys and Overcoming Failure | Confidence comes from success]], but questioning oneself often occurs during failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Failures are considered the best and worst parts of life, serving as the "best teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Failure as a Guide
> While success is a "very loud teacher," failure is described as a friend, philosopher, and guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Nothing significant can happen until one experiences failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It is considered better to encounter failure early in life, as experiencing it after the age of 50 or 60 can be unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The experience of three unsuccessful films after a successful debut was a "great learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

This perspective cultivates practicality, reminding one that luck can change "every Friday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The audience is recognized as knowing the most, underscoring the need to avoid overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Self-Motivation and Support Systems

Self-motivation is paramount, as "no one, not even your partner, motivates you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A personal anecdote illustrates this, recalling how his girlfriend (now wife) laughed when he expressed his ambition to become an actor, especially given his appearance at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This reinforces the idea that an individual must ultimately support themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

> [!TIP] Tips for Regaining Confidence
> For someone who has lost confidence, key advice includes:
> *   Being close to family and friends who genuinely motivate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
> *   Surrounding yourself with people who "show you the real picture" and encourage you, rather than just "yes men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The company you keep significantly impacts your [[role_of_teamwork_and_community_in_personal_growth | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
> *   Making conscious choices that promote sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
> *   Reading a lot of books daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
> *   Continuously evolving and learning new things, as knowledge never goes to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Preparation and Opportunity

Success is defined as the point where "preparation meets opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. While opportunities abound, especially in a place like Mumbai, being well-prepared is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Life also hinges on correct timing, similar to hitting a six or a four in batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The present era is considered the "best era to be an artist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, with increased opportunities open to everyone with talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. There is no longer a lack of opportunities for those with talent and who are willing to audition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

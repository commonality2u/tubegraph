The journey of [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | personal growth]] and self-discovery often involves overcoming significant challenges and redefining one's understanding of self-worth and happiness. For Tanmay Bhat, a prominent figure in the Indian media industry, this journey has been marked by periods of immense productivity, severe setbacks, and profound introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Journey from Rock Bottom

After a year of lacking motivation, Tanmay found himself "neck deep in productivity," creating 15 videos in 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This return to a structured routine brought him immense happiness, noting that a routine is "amazing to have" and provides clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He describes this period as the "happiest I've been because once you hit rock bottom and then you rediscover enthusiasm for life again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Surviving the lowest point led to the realization that "happiness is not about things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Redefining Self-Worth

A significant part of Tanmay's [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | self-discovery]] involved questioning the conventional definition of success. He observed that society often equates self-worth and success solely with career achievements, financial gain, and fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, he now recognizes that self-worth is "not in work but it's beyond that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He challenges the idea that "success equals to career success only," suggesting that success should also be measured by being a good friend or a loyal family member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This shift in perspective came from experiencing a period of intense struggle, including the disintegration of his company, AIB, which led to a time when he didn't have an office to go to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This forced him to confront the question, "If I don't have an office to go to, what am I even a person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## The Power of Routine and Flow

Tanmay emphasizes the importance of routine for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. His daily schedule, from waking up at 2 PM to performing stand-up and streaming, provides a framework for his productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He believes that the meaning of life is "whatever you want the meaning to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, and that life's purpose is to create goals that help one attain a state of "flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Flow occurs when a challenge matches one's skills, avoiding anxiety (if too difficult) or boredom (if too easy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Learning from Failure and Public Scrutiny

Tanmay's [[personal_growth_and_overcoming_failure | personal growth and overcoming failure]] is deeply intertwined with the public controversies and ultimate closure of AIB. The experience of letting go of all AIB employees was one of the "pretty terrible" moments of his life, causing him to break down and cry in front of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This period, though "extremely dark," was also "extremely enlightening," forcing him to realize his identity beyond his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

On public perception, Tanmay learned that "everything you read in the news not necessarily the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He cautions against judging people based on incomplete information, as "the truth is extremely complicated and nuanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. He suggests that those who are "least accepting of other people's flaws are unaware of their own flaws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, linking harsh judgment to a lack of self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## Leadership and Self-Awareness

Reflecting on his time leading AIB, Tanmay admitted that he was "extremely insecure" as a leader, which affected his ability to bring out the best in his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. He believes that "most bad bosses are bosses who are insecure themselves" and that managers who are cruel are often "compensating for their own insecurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data= "00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. His growth has led him to be "a lot more secure now" and more accepting of his own imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.

## The Impact of Physical Transformation

Tanmay's [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | personal growth]] also involved a significant physical transformation. He recalled a period where he was 245 kilograms and suffered from acute sleep apnea, which caused him to stop breathing and nearly die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This terrifying experience, occurring just after the "roast" (a comedy show), made him realize it was "time to pack my and get my in order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

He highlights that losing weight is "equally a painful mental exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>. His past struggles with diet were due to a mindset of "binge cheating" once he deviated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. Now, his mindset has shifted to making better choices even when "cheating," focusing on sustainable, small changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. He believes that losing weight drastically changes one's thought process, leading to increased [[building_selfconfidence_and_happiness | self-confidence and happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.

## Processing Childhood Trauma

Tanmay candidly shares the deep-seated trauma from being bullied as a child due to his weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. He realized that many adults who were overweight as children "haven't done is process the just the level of trauma that you went through as as a kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. This unprocessed trauma can lead to a belief that one doesn't "deserve happiness," unconsciously driving behaviors like overeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. He encourages bullied kids to "sit down and cried out" instead of shutting down, highlighting how men often lack the "skills to handle their own emotional vent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

## Patience and Long-Term Games

A key lesson learned during his period of low motivation is the importance of patience. Tanmay realized that "life is extremely long and life is what you make of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. He advises playing "long-term games" and not being in a hurry, contrasting this with the instant gratification often sought in the social media era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. His experiences, with their many ups and downs, have instilled in him a deep gratitude and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

## The Role of Therapy and Environment

After being diagnosed with clinical depression, Tanmay moved to Bangalore, recognizing the need to "get out this city" (Mumbai) where everyone was from the media world, which made it hard to feel better about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Bangalore, with its focus on wealth games and collaboration rather than status games, offered a refreshing change of environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This shift helped him turn sadness into "fuel for growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

He also found immense value in therapy, describing it as "going to the gym for your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. Therapy provides a detached space to process thoughts and gain self-awareness, something difficult to achieve with friends who are inherently part of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. Alongside therapy, he has embraced meditation, finding "no stimulation time" crucial for observing thoughts and gaining clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. This increased [[spiritual_growth_and_purpose | self-awareness]] helped him recognize his dependence on "external validation," an "illness that gets to all social media influencers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Reflections on Growth

Tanmay's journey underscores the continuous nature of [[personal_growth_and_purpose_in_life | personal growth]]. He now seeks to empower others by fostering an environment where young talents are encouraged to develop their potential and eventually "go do your own thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. He values "lazy geniuses" who find efficient ways to achieve goals, and "fearless" individuals who are willing to adapt and learn, emphasizing that a "brain is a sponge" is preferable to a "rock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. His current perspective is one of acceptance and continued evolution, understanding that "there's more to life than just productivity of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

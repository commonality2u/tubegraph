The right footwear and accessories can significantly enhance a t-shirt outfit, helping to refine your overall look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Footwear Selection

When choosing footwear to pair with t-shirts, it's important to match the casual nature of the garment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **Formal Shoes**: Absolutely no formal shoes should be worn with t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. T-shirts are the most casual piece of dressing, while formal shoes are the most formal, creating a mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Semi-Formal Shoes**: Avoid semi-formal footwear like boots and loafers when wearing t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Recommended Footwear

The best types of footwear to pair with t-shirts are casual options that complement the relaxed style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>:

*   **Sneakers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
*   **Flip-flops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>

These two casual footwear options can look beautiful when colors are matched perfectly with the outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Watch Selection (Accessories)

Watches are key accessories that can elevate or define the tone of a t-shirt outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **Metallic Watches**: Do not wear metallic watches with t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. These watches are intended for formal occasions and are best paired with at least a shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Recommended Watches

*   **Leather-Strapped Watches**: These watches offer a semi-formal touch that can elevate a t-shirt look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Ensure the watch color matches the overall outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Elegant leather-strapped watches can make your look more refined, aligning with the [[tshirt_maturity_scale_and_ageappropriate_dressing|t-shirt maturity scale]] for a slightly older appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Casual Watches**: Watches can set the tone for an outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A more casual watch can create a fun tone for the rest of the outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

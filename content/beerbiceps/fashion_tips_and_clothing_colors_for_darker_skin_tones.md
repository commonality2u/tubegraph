## Understanding Skin Color and Imperialism

The idea that fair skin is superior to dark skin originated during the imperialistic age, when European countries conquered other parts of the world and promoted white skin as better. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> This thought process has unfortunately persisted in many Asian, African, and South American countries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> Your skin color is genetic and should not be changed; instead, focus on making it the best version of itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## Grooming for Glowing, Healthy Skin

### Avoid Skin Whitening Products
Do not chase skin whitening or use skin whitening creams, as they contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids that damage skin quality in the long term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

### Skincare Based on Skin Type
To achieve a healthy glow, tailor your skincare routine to your skin type:

*   **Dry Skin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
    After washing your face and drying it with a towel, apply a mild moisturizer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> Moisturizer is essential if you have dry skin that flakes or dry lips. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) can also be used for glowing, healthy skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   **Oily Skin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
    Use a home remedy with Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), available at Indian grocery stores. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
    *   **Preparation:** Chip off a piece of Fuller's Earth and pound it into a powder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> Mix about half a teaspoon of turmeric (haldi) and a little lemon juice to create a paste, adding a few drops of water if needed for a smooth consistency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
    *   **Application:** Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry, but do not keep it on for longer than 20 minutes before washing it off. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    *   **Benefits:** Turmeric cleanses the face (antiseptic), lemon enhances glow, and Fuller's Earth absorbs excess oil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
    *   **Frequency:** Use this mixture no more than once or twice a week, ideally with a 3-day gap, to avoid over-secretion of oil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> You should see results within a month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

### Exfoliation for Glowing Skin
To achieve "baby type" skin, use a face scrub with hard particles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   **Application:** Massage your face firmly in circular motions, pressing hard enough to feel a slight tingling sensation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   **Benefits:** This increases blood circulation to the face, promoting skin growth and glow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   **Caution:** Do not use this method if you are very acne-prone or have active acne, as it can harm inflammations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   **Frequency:** Exfoliate no more than once a week, perhaps on the same day you use Multani Mitti. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

### Diet for Clear Skin
Focus on your diet for clear, glowing skin:
*   **Hydration:** Stay hydrated throughout the day, aiming for clear urine most of the time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Prioritize nutritionally dense vegetables over fruits for more vitamins and minerals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> A quick rule of thumb is to include a variety of colored vegetables. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

### Maintaining Facial Hair
Looking neat is crucial for enhancing your appearance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   **Beard Maintenance:** If you choose to keep a beard, maintain it well by using grooming products or regularly trimming it to look neat, not like a bush. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   **Patchy Beards:** If you have a patchy beard that grows in spots, it's generally better to avoid a beard entirely and go clean-shaven. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> A patchy beard can make you look scruffy and unprofessional. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> Virat Kohli's beard is an example of a well-maintained, enhancing beard. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>

## Fashion Tips and Clothing Colors

### Prioritize Physique Over Color
Your physique is almost 90% of the game when it comes to pulling off any kind of clothing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> You don't need to be a bodybuilder, just look healthy with filled-out arms, chest, legs, and back. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> A good physique can be achieved even with home workouts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> If you have a good physique with the basics correct, you can wear absolutely any color, regardless of the traditional rule to avoid bright colors for darker skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>

### Color Choices Based on Physique
For those who are very skinny or slightly heavier:
*   **Avoid Bright Colors:** Bright colors (like white, bright red, orange, or bright blue) highlight your physique, drawing attention to your body. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> Since your skin tone differs from the T-shirt color, your body is highlighted even more. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   **Prioritize Darker Colors:** Opt for darker colors for your t-shirts and shirts, such as:
    *   Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
    *   Navy blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
    *   Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
    *   Olive green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    *   Dark gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
    *   Dark maroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
    These colors complement a slightly dark, wheatish Indian skin tone very well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>

## Final Advice: Confidence and Self-Love

While [[grooming_tips_for_men_with_darker_skin_tones | grooming]] and [[fashion_tips_for_indian_men | fashion tips]] are helpful, they are not as important as developing positivity and confidence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> People are attracted to internal qualities like self-love and being comfortable in your own skin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> Do not believe that fair skin is superior to dark skin or that dark skin doesn't look good. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> All skin types are considered beautiful today, and promoting the idea that dark skin is undesirable promotes racism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

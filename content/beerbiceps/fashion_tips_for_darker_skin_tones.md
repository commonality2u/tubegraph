The desire for fair skin, particularly in regions like Africa, South America, and the Asia-Pacific, stemmed from the imperialistic age when European countries influenced the perception that white skin was superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This mentality was unfortunately reinforced by advertisements promoting fairness as a prerequisite for success or love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, skin color is genetic and should not be changed, but rather optimized to be its best version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Acceptance
It is crucial to understand that fair skin is not superior to dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In 2018, all skin types are considered beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Believing otherwise promotes a racist idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Ultimately, attraction is based on positivity and confidence, more so than external appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The most important step is to love yourself and be comfortable in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Grooming Tips for Glowing Skin
For Indian skin tone, the focus should be on achieving healthy, glowing skin rather than altering its natural color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Avoid Skin Whitening Products
Do not use skin whitening creams as they can harm your face long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These products often contain harmful substances like hydroquinone, mercury, carcinogens, and steroids, which can spoil skin quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Dry Skin Care
If you have dry skin, a mild moisturizer is your best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. After washing your face, dry it with a towel and then apply moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For dry lips, apply moisturizer or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This helps achieve glowing, healthy skin over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Oily Skin Care: Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth)
For oily skin, a home remedy using Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth) can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** Buy a block of Fuller's Earth, chip off a piece, and pound it into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Mix half a teaspoon of turmeric and a squeeze of lemon juice to create a paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Add a few drops of water if needed to get a smooth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Application:** Apply a thin layer to your face and let it dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Important:** Do not leave it on for longer than 20 minutes before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Turmeric cleanses and acts as an antiseptic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, lemon helps increase skin glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and Fuller's Earth absorbs oil from the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Use this mixture no more than once or twice a week, ideally with a 3-day gap, to prevent the skin from secreting more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. You should see a change within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Exfoliation
To achieve glowing, baby-like skin, use a face scrub, which is a face wash with small hard particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Technique:** Massage your face firmly in a circular motion, ensuring a slight tingling feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** This increases blood circulation to your face, promoting skin growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Caution:** Do not use this method if you are acne-prone or have active acne, as it can harm inflammations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** Exfoliate no more than once a week, possibly on the same day you use the Multani Mitti mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Diet and Hydration
For clear, glowing skin, focus on your diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Water Intake:** Stay hydrated throughout the day, aiming for clear urine most of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Vegetable and Fiber Intake:** Prioritize vegetables, which are nutritionally denser than fruits, providing more vitamins and minerals for the same food amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A quick rule of thumb is to consume a variety of colorful vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## General Grooming: Beard Maintenance
Focus on looking neat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. If you keep a beard, maintain it well using grooming products or by regularly trimming it to ensure it looks neat and not like a "big bush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. If you have a patchy beard, it's generally better to avoid a beard entirely and go clean-shaven, as a patchy beard can make you look scruffy and may not be suitable for a corporate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Virat Kohli's beard is an example of a well-maintained beard that enhances appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Fashion Tips for Darker Skin Tones
[[mens_fashion_tips_for_indian_men | Mens fashion tips for Indian men]] should always consider physique as a primary factor.

### Physique First
To be able to wear any type of clothing effectively, prioritize working on your physique, as it accounts for almost 90% of your overall look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. You don't need to be a bodybuilder, but aim to look healthy with filled-out arms, chest, and worked legs and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. A good physique can be achieved even through home workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Color Choices
The traditional rule suggests darker skin tones should avoid bright colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. However, this rule becomes irrelevant if you have a good physique; you can wear absolutely any color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

If you are very skinny or slightly on the heavier side, bright colors should be approached with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Bright colors like white, red, orange, or bright blue highlight your physique and draw more attention to your body, especially since your skin tone contrasts with the shirt color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In such cases, it's better to avoid brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Recommended Colors
For t-shirts and shirts, prioritize darker colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Navy blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Olive green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   Dark gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Dark maroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

These colors complement the slightly dark, wheatish Indian skin tone very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. However, choosing colors is less important than achieving a good physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Beyond Appearance: Positivity and Confidence
Attractiveness is not solely about external appearance; people are drawn to positivity and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Before focusing on fashion or [[adding_personality_and_detail_to_outfits_with_accessories | adding personality and detail to outfits with accessories]] and grooming, cultivate self-love and comfort in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

When suffering from dandruff, using an anti-dandruff shampoo is often recommended at least once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, it's important to consider the type of shampoo used, as many conventional anti-dandruff products contain harmful chemicals that can negatively impact hair quality long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Issues with Conventional Anti-Dandruff Shampoos
Most anti-dandruff shampoos found on the market often contain sulfates, parabens, and other harmful chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. These ingredients can spoil the quality of your hair over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Organic Anti-Dandruff Shampoos
Opting for organic anti-dandruff shampoos, especially those that are sulfate and paraben-free, can provide a more beneficial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These shampoos are designed to help set the pH of your scalp right, which is crucial for treating dandruff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The skin's pH is naturally slightly acidic (around 5.5), which helps kill harmful bacteria and infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Dandruff often occurs when the scalp's pH is off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Organic shampoos can help restore this acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, similar to how [[role_of_home_remedies_in_treating_dandruff | home remedies]] like curd, lemon, or apple cider vinegar work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Beyond treating dandruff, these organic options also help maintain the overall quality of your hair in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While [[role_of_home_remedies_in_treating_dandruff | home remedies]] like apple cider vinegar are acidic and can help cleanse the scalp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, a good quality organic hair product, specifically an anti-dandruff shampoo, is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

For those [[choosing_the_right_shampoo | choosing the right shampoo]] for dandruff, considering an organic, sulfate- and paraben-free option is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The narrator shares personal experiences with sleep paralysis and unexplained phenomena throughout their life, leading to a deeper exploration of [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:23">[08:23:23]</a>.

## Understanding Sleep Paralysis
Sleep paralysis is described as a scientific phenomenon where an individual partially wakes up during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:14">[01:53:14]</a>.
*   **Mechanism** When sleeping, the brain signals the muscular system to remain still, acting as a protective mechanism to prevent physical reactions to dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>. The body becomes paralyzed by the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:08">[02:11:08]</a>.
*   **Symptoms** Those experiencing sleep paralysis may open their eyes but be unable to move, scream, or make any sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>. Their only conscious awareness is their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.
*   **Severe Cases** In severe cases, nightmares can integrate into the experience, as the brain struggles to differentiate between dreams/nightmares and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:39">[02:44:39]</a>.

## Early Encounters
From childhood, the narrator felt a presence watching them, especially in the dark or alone in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. This led to a prolonged fear of sleeping alone until the age of 19 or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. Their childhood home, located above a family-owned hospital, seemed to be a focal point for these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

### The Scariest Sleep Paralysis Incident
At age 11, while sleeping next to their mother, the narrator had their most frightening sleep paralysis experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>.
*   **Initial Experience** Regular sleep paralysis often involved waking up to see a shadowy figure in the room, with the only escape being to close one's eyes and hope to fall back asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Deepening Terror** During this particular incident, the narrator felt "little shadowy creatures" chaining them down to the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. These creatures seemed to be welcoming a "lady" or "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>.
*   **The Entity** A woman with pale, torn, and blistered skin, untidy hair, and a single pale red eye was seen sitting on the narrator's chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:35">[04:16:35]</a>. The narrator felt her weight and fingers, unable to move or scream despite attempting to call for their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:34">[04:45:34]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Intervention** Growing up in a [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | spiritual]] family, the narrator's mother had taught them a mantra to ward off bad spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:13">[05:20:13]</a>. The narrator closed their eyes and repeatedly chanted "Om Namah Shivaya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:13">[05:39:13]</a>. After this, the entity vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:16">[06:01:16]</a>.

## External Confirmations and Shared Phenomena
Years later, at age 13, the narrator watched a National Geographic show about alien abductions that depicted a reenactment of a Japanese phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:03">[06:16:03]</a>.
*   **[[cultural_interpretations_of_sleep_paralysis | Japanese Phenomenon]]** This phenomenon involved sleep paralysis accompanied by a witch sitting on top of the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:11">[06:37:11]</a>.
*   **Alien Abduction Theory** The show proposed that aliens might simulate this experience, creating the imagery of a woman sitting on the human, to manipulate perception during experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>.
*   **Striking Similarities** The visual representation of the woman in the show exactly matched the narrator's own experience, including the single staring eye, hair covering one side, burnt skin, untidy clothes, and pale, dead eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:15">[07:17:15]</a>.
*   **Hospital Accounts** The narrator later inquired with their grandfather, who owned the building and hospital since the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:27">[12:01:27]</a>. Patients recovering in rooms directly below the narrator's childhood bedroom had reported similar experiences: feeling a woman sitting on their chest at night, or being pushed off their beds by a flash of a scary-looking woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:30">[12:20:30]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear Through Spirituality
The narrator's fear of the dark was deeper than a mere lack of light, stemming from the feeling of an entity constantly staring at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:20">[13:41:20]</a>. They eventually overcame this phobia by embracing [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:23">[08:23:23]</a>.
*   **Facing Fear** As stated in *Autobiography of a Yogi*, facing fear makes it cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:07">[08:48:07]</a>.
*   **Meditation** The narrator started meditating frequently around age 22 or 23, often with their co-founder Rajas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. During one late-night meditation session in the building's garage, both felt a "dark" and negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. By continuously meditating and chanting the "Om Namah Shivaya" mantra, they felt they pushed out this negative energy from the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:08">[10:08:08]</a>.
*   **[[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | Psychic Confirmation]]** A [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychic friend]] later visited their office in the same building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:20">[10:58:20]</a>. Without prior knowledge, the friend walked directly to the room below the narrator's childhood bedroom and stated it had a lot of [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | dark energy]], suggesting a [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | demon]] or [[understanding_spirits_ghosts_and_demonic_entities | ghost]] had been present but was likely pushed out by their meditation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:17">[11:30:17]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Cleansing** Since the [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychic]]'s examination, pujas and Havens (rituals) have been performed, and candles lit in the building to promote a positive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:38">[13:14:38]</a>. The hospital is now defunct, and the negative presence is no longer felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:21">[13:00:21]</a>.

The narrator's personal journey has led to a strong embrace of [[impact_of_spirituality_and_meditation_on_personal_life | spirituality]] due to their [[janhvi_kapoors_views_on_the_occult_and_personal_paranormal_experiences | occult experiences]] and the realization that spiritual practices can combat [[experiences_with_demonic_entities | dark energies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

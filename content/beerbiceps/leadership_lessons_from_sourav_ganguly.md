> The host of the podcast views Sourav Ganguly as a personal idol and a source of profound [[leadership_and_mentorship_experiences_in_cricket | leadership]] lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. He credits Ganguly's autobiography, "A Century is Not Enough," with providing him his "higher education in life," influencing everything from visualization and aggression to the scaling of his two-person team into an organization of 180 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:33">[02:50:33]</a>. The host states that Ganguly is his "MBA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, emphasizing the depth of his impact.

## Philosophy on Pressure and Opportunity

Sourav Ganguly does not view responsibilities or high-stakes situations as a burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. Instead, he sees them as an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. He reflects on his career, noting that the chance to bat at number three for India or captain the team for 250 games is a privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. This mindset is crucial for navigating professional sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>:

> "There are two ways of looking at it, you think it as a pressure why me or or you look at it it's me try me yeah and I'll stand up and it's it's for yourself not for anybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

### Bouncing Back from Setbacks

In professional sports, losses are inevitable, but the key is the opportunity to bounce back quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Ganguly emphasizes the continuous cycle of performing, losing, and having another chance in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. He experienced rough phases, such as during a tour against Pakistan in 2004 when he struggled for runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. To cope with nervousness, he would run for extended periods, noting that exercise was a regular part of staying fit, but this was specifically to manage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

To mentally prepare and overcome negative thoughts, Ganguly relied on focusing on past successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. He kept a small note in his kit bag detailing his routines, what he ate, when he went to the gym, and how many balls he hit when he achieved a Test match hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. This psychological approach helped him feel prepared for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. He believes that strong self-faith is essential for navigating challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

> "The best thing what this game has done is is is for myself is gave me enormous faith in my ability even even when you were at the peak of your sadness you backed yourself put me in a position I'll find my way so that's what this that's what success does to everyone actually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Team Building

Ganguly's on-field aggression was a deliberate "creation to be successful" rather than his natural temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. He describes himself as a very laid-back, quiet, and soft person who rarely gets angry or shouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. This aggressive persona was adopted to succeed and motivate the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

### Building the Team and Fostering Talent

As captain, Ganguly believed in a specific style of playing and selected players accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. He focused on getting the right players, fostering the correct attitudes, and establishing a positive work ethic and atmosphere within the dressing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

His team, which included [[leadership_and_mentorship_experiences_in_cricket | champion players]] like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, and Zaheer Khan, was a reflection of his own mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He is a strong believer that "talent is only good with opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. He consciously allowed players to express themselves and become an integral part of the team, thereby creating individual leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

> "You have to create 11 leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Understanding Individuals

Ganguly believes that a leader's greatest characteristic is the ability to work with everyone on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. He fostered an environment where individual players could express themselves authentically, understanding that different players have different strengths and styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. For example, he wouldn't ask Rahul Dravid to play like him or Virender Sehwag to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Impact and Evolution

Sourav Ganguly believes that the country's cricket captain sets the tone for an entire generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. He acknowledges the immense pressure and constant evaluation from the public, media, and selectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. His advice for players under intense scrutiny is to "just shut that off" and focus on their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### From Player to Administrator

Having experienced both roles as a player/captain and now an administrator in the BCCI, Ganguly feels he has seen the complete circle of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. He finds playing more challenging and satisfying due to its real-time nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. However, he recognizes the critical importance of administration in sports and believes that India's success is partly due to strong administrative foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. His experience as a player gives him a unique understanding of player psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. He notes a trend in India where former players are increasingly involved in administration, which he views as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

Ganguly advises young people facing challenges to view them as opportunities and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. He states that he wouldn't change anything in his career because decisions were made in the moment, and hindsight is always easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

His advice for young cricketers in the world of "glitz and glam" is to "just focus on the game, just play the game, give you give your time to the game, everything will be looked after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of preparation in everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

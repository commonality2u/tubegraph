Space exploration, by its very nature, often necessitates global cooperation to address shared challenges and advance scientific understanding. While individual nations and private entities strive for their own achievements, there are various forms of collaboration that exist between international space agencies.

## Data Sharing Policies

The sharing of data between space agencies is generally restrictive, particularly concerning classified information or newly acquired scientific data.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a> Typically, data from science missions might be shared after a "lock-in period," but classified information is never released.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>

*   **NASA and [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]]**: While there is no direct exchange of technology, [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] and NASA collaborate by sharing competencies on common projects.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>
    *   For instance, in the NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite project, NASA built the L-band radar, and [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] built the S-band radar.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a> The software was written to integrate both, and [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] built and will launch the primary satellite.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>
    *   NASA is keen to work with [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]], and there's a strong link at the government level to cooperate on space.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a> This was solidified when President Biden and Prime Minister Modi signed an agreement to work on International Space Station (ISS) utilization.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a> As a result, [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] astronauts are currently undergoing training at NASA.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>
*   **China and [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]]**: While direct technology sharing does not occur, some earth observation data is shared.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a> For example, there's a BRICS consortia where member nations pool their satellite data onto a common platform.

## Addressing Global Threats

International collaboration is crucial for addressing threats like asteroids that pose a risk to Earth.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>

*   **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**: Space agencies discuss NEOs in various forums, including the UN COPUOS.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>
*   **Defense Strategies**: The primary actions involve:
    1.  **Observation and Tracking**: Continuously monitoring objects using radars and ground-based observations, which is challenging as objects can come from any direction.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>
    2.  **Prediction and Trajectory Calculation**: Accurately predicting if and when an object will collide with Earth, considering the complex movements of celestial bodies.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>
    3.  **Deflection**: If a collision is predicted years in advance, sending a rocket to impart a small velocity change to the asteroid can deflect its path by millions of kilometers, preventing impact.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a> Exploding an asteroid with nuclear bombs is less practical as parts could still hit Earth, and pulverizing it entirely is difficult.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>

## Potential for Public-Private Partnerships

The future of space tourism and commercial space activities may involve collaboration between national agencies and private companies.

*   **[[isros_future_plans_and_challenges | ISRO]] as an Enabler**: [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]]'s mandate is to develop technology and create the necessary infrastructure for industries to commercialize space activities.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:59">[02:42:59]</a>
    *   [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] focuses on technology development and then transitions the production and commercial exploitation of rockets and other systems to industry partners.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:22">[02:43:22]</a> This model is also envisioned for space tourism.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a>
    *   The goal is to increase India's contribution to the global space economy (currently 2% of $400 billion annually) by encouraging private sector participation.
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:14">[03:16:14]</a> This requires industries to build rockets, satellites, ground stations, and provide services, thereby scaling up the overall space activity and creating more launch opportunities for [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]].
        <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:32">[03:16:32]</a>

### Teaming up with Elon Musk

Dr. S. Somanath, Chairperson of [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]], expresses admiration for Elon Musk's work in rockets and reusability, often citing him in internal discussions about design concepts.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

*   **Shared Vision**: Dr. Somanath would ask Musk about his vision for moving human beings to exosolar planets.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>
*   **Open to Collaboration**: When asked about teaming up with Elon Musk, Dr. Somanath stated, "Why not? Definitely," provided the collaboration is on "equal footing."
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>
*   **Musk's Influence**: Elon Musk has publicly cheered for [[indian_space_research_organization_isro_achievements_and_projects | ISRO]] on social media.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a> His ability to integrate technology with the "politics of applying technology" and bring visions to fruition is seen as remarkable.
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

## Importance of Global Perspective

Space activity inherently fosters a sense of unity among humanity.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a> Looking at Earth from space can make one realize its fragility, dissolving boundaries and fostering a shared responsibility to protect it.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a> This global perspective reinforces the idea that work done in space, while making individual nations proud, ultimately benefits all of humankind.

History, as commonly taught, particularly in India, may contain significant gaps and misinformation, leading to a distorted understanding of ancient civilizations and their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">04:07:07</a>. The evolution of knowledge and global communication are now bringing these discrepancies to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">05:21:00</a>.

## Challenges in Interpreting and Presenting Historical Events

Traditional history books, often written a century or two ago, contain a "calculated bias" designed to spread misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">04:56:00</a>. With increased globalization and the spread of information through social media, it's becoming clear that history books are "full of misinformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">05:20:00</a>.

### The Problem of Stagnant Progress in Historical Narratives
Human evolution typically shows improvement over time, where newer creations surpass older ones in size or sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">00:07:00</a>. For example, the Eiffel Tower was succeeded by the CN Tower, which was then surpassed by the Burj Khalifa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">00:20:58</a>. However, this pattern of evolution is conspicuously absent in the narrative of ancient Indian structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">00:22:05</a>.

Examples:
*   The largest and oldest cave temple structure in India is the Ajanta Caves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">00:21:30</a>. Despite being over 2,000 years old, no subsequent structures were built to be larger or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">00:22:15</a>.
*   Similarly, the Kalai Dam, India's largest and oldest ancient dam (2,000 years old), has not been surpassed by later constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">00:22:51</a>.
*   The Kailasa Temple, carved from a single stone 1,300 years ago, demonstrates an unparalleled feat of engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">00:10:02</a>. Yet, no subsequent temples have attempted to replicate or improve upon this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">00:22:53</a>.

This lack of evolutionary progression suggests that ancient civilizations possessed technologies or knowledge that were either lost or intentionally downplayed in historical accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">00:23:22</a>.

### Advanced Ancient Technologies
Contrary to the mainstream narrative that ancient temples were built with primitive tools like chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">00:31:50</a>, evidence suggests the use of advanced machinery:
*   **Lathe Machines:** Pillars in temples like Hoysaleswara and Chennakesava in Karnataka show clear turn marks, indicating they were made using lathe machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">00:47:00</a>. Archaeologists confirm this, albeit with embarrassment, as these machines would have needed to be enormous (300-400 meters long) to process 20-ton pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">00:28:11</a>. This technology, capable of creating perfect circular shapes, is rudimentary in modern engineering but was advanced for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">00:27:25</a>.
*   **Hollow Stone Carvings:** Intricate stone skulls on doorkeepers (*dwarpalikas*) in temples, measuring only about one inch in diameter, are completely hollow, with threads able to pass through their ears, eyes, and mouths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">00:30:53</a>. Such precision is impossible with basic chisels and hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">00:31:39</a>.
*   **Earthquake-Proofing Technology:** The Ramappa Temple in Telangana, built 800-900 years ago, uses lightweight, floating bricks similar to modern autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">00:33:05</a>. This allowed the temple to withstand a massive earthquake that destroyed all other structures in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">00:34:50</a>. This technology is now used by Japanese builders for earthquake resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">00:34:53</a>.

These discoveries contradict the notion of primitive building techniques and highlight a "calculated plan" to withhold this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">00:36:55</a>.

### The Purpose of Ancient Temples
Ancient temples were not merely places of worship but served as "Wikipedia in stone" or "town museums" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">01:25:27</a>. Their carvings provided educational content tailored to different age groups:
*   **Ages 0-5:** Depictions of animals, like a baby elephant drinking milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">01:20:20</a>.
*   **Ages 6-10:** Carvings related to music and dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">01:21:26</a>.
*   **Ages 11-15:** Displays of science and technology, such as a sundial at Konark Temple that can tell time to the minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">01:21:42</a>.
*   **Ages 16-20:** Scenes of war, administration, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">01:22:20</a>.
*   **Ages 21-25:** Erotica and depictions of human life, including methods of childbirth (standing delivery, now a recommended practice) and post-birth rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">01:23:06</a>.
Only above these levels do carvings of gods appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">01:25:15</a>. This detailed, multi-layered approach suggests that ancient societies sought to document knowledge for future generations, choosing stone for its durability against erosion and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">01:25:31</a>.

## Controversial perspectives on Indian history

India's history of invasions has led to the destruction of many ancient temples, particularly in North and Central India, leaving much of the ancient secrets intact only in South India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">06:37:00</a>. This historical context contributes to misunderstandings and divisions within the country, as people in the South sometimes mock those in the North for not having as many ancient temples, unaware that the North fought invaders more intensely to protect what remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">08:16:00</a>.

### Censorship of Cultural Representation
Modern platforms, such as YouTube, actively censor content related to ancient Indian temples, often citing "nudity" or "violence" in carvings of gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">00:52:21</a>. This behavior, seen as a "racist angle," aims to modify the behavior of content creators and discourage the promotion of Hindu temples, despite similar nude depictions of Greek gods in Athens museums remaining uncensored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">00:57:01</a>. This suggests a deliberate attempt to program people away from the Hindu cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">00:58:38</a>.

### Global Human Migration and Historical Perspectives
The history taught in schools often suggests that Indian civilization began relatively recently, with the Indus Valley Civilization, and then flourished after Mughal and European invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">01:18:21</a>. This overlooks a deeper, more advanced past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">01:19:02</a>.

Colonial powers deliberately imposed false narratives to control and exploit populations:
*   In Australia, European settlers classified Aboriginal people as "flora and fauna" and were permitted to hunt them, erasing much of their culture by separating children from their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">00:37:12</a>.
*   In Africa, colonizers drew straight borders to divide tribes into different countries, ensuring future strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">00:39:31</a>.
*   In India, the British siphoned wealth, instigated the India-Pakistan divide, implemented harmful economic policies, installed puppet leaders, and deliberately "messed up" the education system to distance Indians from their true history and foster a "root learning mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">00:38:58</a>. This has created a generation that struggles to accept the reality of their own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">00:40:37</a>.

## Influence of Alien Theories in Ancient Cultures
The existence of seemingly advanced structures and consistent narratives across disparate ancient civilizations challenges conventional historical timelines and opens the door to discussions about alternative theories, including the [[influence_of_alien_theories_in_ancient_cultures | influence of alien theories in ancient cultures]].

### The Naga Phenomenon
Nagas, often misinterpreted as mere snakes, are described in ancient Hindu texts not as snakes or humans, but as a distinct species or race of humanoids capable of shape-shifting and living underground (Paatal Lok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">00:50:51</a>. Intriguingly, similar figures are worshipped across the world:
*   In Peru, they are called Amaru (a Sanskrit word meaning immortal god) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">00:59:42</a>.
*   In Colombia, ancient carvings show Nagas guarding Shivlings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">00:59:51</a>.
*   In Israel, they are called Nakash, similar to the Sanskrit "sarpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">01:00:38</a>.

Ancient civilizations across the globe share a common story: the very first rulers, or "Naga Kings," were non-human beings who came from "somewhere" and initiated civilization, teaching humans construction and other technologies before vanishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">01:03:00</a>. This narrative is found in local accounts from remote villages in India (e.g., Kurur Caves, Bali Para, K Benno), where villagers describe short beings who descended from the sky, civilized humans, and then disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">01:04:34</a>.

The pervasive presence of Naga carvings in almost all ancient temples and structures worldwide, regardless of other deities present, suggests they are the "oldest Gods around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">01:15:55</a>. The concept of "reptilians controlling humans," though often ridiculed, parallels these ancient narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">01:16:32</a>.

### Depictions of Extinct Species
Temples also contain carvings of animals long extinct, raising questions about the knowledge possessed by ancient builders:
*   At Ta Prohm Temple in Cambodia, a Stegosaurus is accurately carved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">01:14:17</a>. Dinosaurs are believed to have become extinct 65 million years ago, long before the temple was built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">00:48:03</a>.
*   At Angkor Wat, an elephant with four tusks, a species extinct approximately 100,000 years ago, is depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">01:14:44</a>.
Such accurate depictions of extinct species suggest that ancient sculptors either had access to historical records or direct knowledge that defies modern understanding of their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">01:14:26</a>.

## Reclaiming History and Encouraging Critical Thinking
Independent researchers, like Praveen Mohan and Graham Hancock, are crucial in uncovering and presenting [[Archaeological discoveries challenging traditional historical narratives | archaeological discoveries challenging traditional historical narratives]] and [[conspiracy_theories_and_lesserknown_historical_perspectives | lesser-known historical perspectives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">01:28:24</a>. Their work highlights that much of history is fragmented and lost, and modern science can benefit from uncovering these hidden truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">01:30:29</a>.

It is important for individuals to:
*   Approach history with an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">01:41:47</a>.
*   Use critical thinking and question narratives, especially those presented at "face value" in history books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">01:27:01</a>.
*   Be curious about the "wonders of history and the wonders of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">01:27:42</a>.

The prevailing notion that modern civilization is the most advanced might be a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">01:27:44</a>. There is evidence suggesting that more advanced civilizations existed before us, possibly even including non-human beings who contributed to early human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">01:27:46</a>.

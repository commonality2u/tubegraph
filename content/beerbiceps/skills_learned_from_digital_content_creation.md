The journey of creating digital content, particularly as young entrepreneurs managing college life, has equipped the founders of Slayy Point, Gautami and Abhyuday, with a diverse set of invaluable skills. These go beyond academic learning, offering practical experience and personal growth that they consider more impactful than traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:25">[05:46:25]</a>.

## Time Management and Prioritization
Balancing demanding college schedules with consistent content creation required strict discipline. The duo learned to develop a proper schedule and prioritize tasks, ensuring both academic and YouTube commitments were met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. They couldn't afford to take more than one day off from college per week due to attendance requirements, forcing them to complete shoots within tight deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>. This rigorous schedule taught them to maximize efficiency, allowing them to complete tasks in significantly less time than their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:26">[11:00:26]</a>. Interestingly, their academic marks actually improved after starting YouTube, which they attribute to better time utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:15">[10:49:15]</a>.

## Self-Belief and Overcoming Limiting Mindsets
A crucial lesson learned "very recently" was believing in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:47">[09:12:47]</a>. Initially, they often limited themselves, thinking they couldn't achieve certain things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. However, upon attempting these challenges, they realized they were "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:27">[09:22:27]</a>. This journey has helped them break through mental blocks associated with being young or "too small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:02">[08:11:02]</a>, realizing that age doesn't always correlate with experience or knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Communication and Public Speaking
Initially introverted, the demands of digital content creation forced them to engage with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:24">[05:58:24]</a>. Hosting events like red carpets, despite initial apprehension, significantly boosted their confidence in speaking on stage and interacting with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:09">[06:04:09]</a>. This experience honed their [[improving_communication_skills | communication skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>, making them more adept at public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:15">[06:14:15]</a>.

## Business Acumen and Brand Management
Beyond video creation, Slayy Point's involvement in the business aspects of YouTube taught them about brand management and financial dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. They learned to interact with brands and understand the intricacies of the digital marketing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:15">[05:17:15]</a>. Their acquired skills in this area are so substantial that it's believed they could secure a strong marketing job if they chose to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:14">[05:27:14]</a>. They've gained practical knowledge of the industry, understanding how to expand and leverage their experience beyond just a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:31">[05:07:31]</a>.

## Pressure Handling and Criticism Management
The public nature of YouTube exposed them to immense pressure and criticism. They learned the vital skill of handling pressure, managing criticism, and ignoring negative comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:32">[06:32:32]</a>. Recognizing that "you can never please anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:11">[06:46:11]</a>, they developed resilience against online haters and even discouraging remarks from family who doubted the longevity of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:06">[03:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:02">[09:03:02]</a>.

## Adaptability and Self-Learning
The entire process of creating content, from scripting and ideating to shooting and editing, was learned through self-interest and practice, not formal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:06">[11:56:06]</a>. They emphasize that anyone interested in making content can learn the necessary skills over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:03">[12:00:03]</a>. This highlights their ability to adapt and acquire new knowledge independently within the dynamic digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:02">[07:21:02]</a>.

## Overall Impact
These skills, developed through their hands-on experience in [[journalism_and_content_creation_dynamics | digital content creation]], have provided Slayy Point with a "bigger education" than their college, preparing them for the real world with a strong practical approach to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:25">[05:46:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:12">[07:04:12]</a>. They are confident that the skills acquired over three years are sufficient for them to survive and thrive, even without a Masters degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:02">[07:12:02]</a>.

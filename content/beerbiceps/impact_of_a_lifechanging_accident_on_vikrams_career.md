Vikram's acting career and [[chiyaan_vikrams_acting_journey_and_challenges | journey to stardom]] was profoundly shaped by a severe accident he experienced during his college years, which instilled in him an unyielding determination and a deep appreciation for his profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

## The Accident and Immediate Aftermath
The accident occurred when Vikram was going on a bike after a college play called "Black Comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. He was riding on a bike with a friend who, playfully, put his legs on the crash guard, preventing him from braking when a truck with buffaloes almost hit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. The lorry hit Vikram, breaking his thigh in two places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

Upon arrival at a government hospital, due to internal hematoma and loss of pulse, doctors initially recommended amputation of his leg, believing he would die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. His mother refused, and he was transferred to a private hospital where doctors performed "magic" to release the blood and restore his pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. He still had gangrene and was bedridden for three years, undergoing 23 surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Following this, he spent another year on crutches, not walking for a total of four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. Doctors informed him he might never walk again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

## Unwavering Dream and Recovery
Despite the grim prognosis, Vikram's dream of becoming an actor persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. He made a conscious decision to not only walk but to run, making his weakness his strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. He diligently worked on his recovery, swimming and working out, transitioning from two crutches to one, then a walking stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. His knee could not bend fully due to the delayed operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

He even considered purposefully amputating his leg to pursue an acting career, thinking it would allow him to specialize in roles like a karate film with a false leg, a thought his mother promptly dismissed as "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

## Career Path and Struggle
For ten years after his recovery, Vikram faced a significant struggle in the film industry, with his films consistently failing at the box office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. This long and intense struggle, marked by frequent setbacks, meant that success remained a distant dream for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. He persisted, eventually finding his way into films after a television serial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

His breakthrough came with the film *Sethu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. The film faced numerous challenges, including multiple cast changes, a runaway producer, and a year-long delay in release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. Despite initial low turnout in a single theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>, positive reviews and word-of-mouth transformed it into a massive success, earning him the title "Chiyaan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. This first major success after a long struggle remains one of his most cherished memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

Ashish Chanchlani is a prominent Indian YouTuber known for his comedic vines and sketches. His journey into content creation was shaped by his family's values, his early experiences in business, and his inherent passion for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Early Life and Values
Ashish's parents instilled in him a strong sense of humility and the importance of working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They observed that he and his sister, Muskan, were "very humble, very good," and treated everyone equally, from their cook to their watchman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They never felt jealous of others' success, including fellow YouTubers like Amit Bhadana, but rather felt positive and inspired by their hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

His father emphasized that true success lies in maintaining humility, regardless of fame or numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Growing up, Ashish's father exposed him to film stars like Aamir Khan and Sunny Deol, teaching him that success in the entertainment industry is transient and tied to a project's performance, reinforcing the idea that "success is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This foundation helped him avoid the pitfalls of wealth and fame, unlike some "sheltered" rich kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Roots and Work Ethic
Ashish's father, who is from the world of business, noted Ashish's strength in business as a key factor in his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Ashish was working with his father in their multiplex business from the age of 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He regularly handled banking, depositing cash daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He was instrumental in bringing high technology like 3D and 7.1 Dolby sound to their multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Ashish convinced his father to prioritize Hollywood movies and technology, which led to the creation of state-of-the-art multiplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This early immersion in business and his passion for movies significantly shaped his personality and future career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Transition to YouTube and Content Philosophy
Initially, when Ashish started his vine channel, his mother was concerned, thinking he might have "gone mad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, upon seeing his videos, she became supportive and even reviewed his vines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. She advised him against posting daily to avoid audience fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Ashish's journey into YouTube began as a [[balancing_creativity_and_business_in_youtube_career | passion project]] because he had wanted to act for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. His mindset was never solely about earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He eventually started earning from his content, which his family attributed to his passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

He has a deep understanding of what the Indian audience wants to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. His content primarily features "massy" comedy, similar to the genre of Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgn films, rather than the more sarcastic style of Zoya Akhtar, as this resonates more with the Indian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He believes his videos allow people to forget their problems and simply enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. He focuses on creating content that connects pan-India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Ashish displays an intense [[youtube_content_creation_and_worklife_balance | obsession]] with his work, often immersed in his own world of video concepts and jokes, even talking in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This dedication, particularly for someone starting their career, is seen as crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Parental Guidance and Lessons Learned
When Ashish considered dropping out of engineering to pursue acting, his father encouraged him to finish his studies while pursuing his passion side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. His father emphasized that "education is important" even with passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Ashish learned [[skills_gained_from_youtube_and_their_applicability_in_realworld_jobs | business skills]] and the importance of creating his own identity from his father, who despite being the son of a wealthy man, established himself as a legend in his own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Ashish never wanted to show off inherited wealth but instead desired to be independent and earn on his own feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

His mother instilled in him positivity and optimism, teaching him to find good in every situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Both parents conveyed the importance of never giving up and always treating everyone with love and respect, regardless of how they treat you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Creators and Parents
Ashish's mother advises parents to allow their children to pursue their passions, giving them at least a year to see if they can succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. She believes children should not be restricted but allowed to "fly" and make their own path, as tying them down can lead to confusion about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Nepotism within the film industry, particularly the Indian film industry, presents significant [[challenges_in_the_acting_profession | challenges]] for individuals who grow up within it. While offering certain advantages, it also leads to intense public scrutiny and personal doubts regarding one's own merit and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.

## Personal Impact of Nepotism Claims

Actress Janhvi Kapoor shared that "versions of this nepotism debate" have influenced her life from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>, dating back to her school days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. She recalled remarks like:
*   "Why you did well on that test is because your parents are famous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>
*   "The Teacher star stru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>
*   "This person's only friends with you because... they think you're cool cuz you're famous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>

These constant taunts led her to feel that "it's not you they like it's not you they value it's your parents," which "diminishes or makes you question what you have to offer in this World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

Janhvi acknowledges that there is some truth to the notion that people may be nice based on who one is or where one comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. She prefers to remain "underconfidence" rather than being "delusional" about the attention she receives, stating she would not want to be arrogant about her position in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. This approach helps her avoid complacency in her art and prevent stagnation in personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

## Scientific and Artistic Aspects of Family Background

The host posits that artistic talent can be genetic, drawing parallels to maternal and paternal lineages and the concept of mitochondria passing down energy levels and proactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This implies that being from an artistic family could scientifically contribute to an internal drive towards cinema and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

Janhvi noted this as a "scientific" argument for nepotism, acknowledging that if artistic drive is inherent, "what do you do it's in my mitochondria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

## Advantages of Growing Up in a Film Family

Despite the public perception of nepotism, growing up in a film family offers unique advantages:
*   **Early Exposure and Education:** Janhvi's education was primarily on her father's film sets or traveling with her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   **Practical Skills:** She learned valuable lessons such as respecting people's time, understanding different cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>, and developing emotional intelligence regarding the sensitivity of artists in an artistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
*   **Shared Passion:** The family's deep love for films, cinema, and good honest work drives them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. Janhvi stated that after losing her mother, her love for films has been a significant driving force, almost "keeping me alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

### Parental Influence and Values

Janhvi highlights key traits and values gained from her parents:
*   **From her father:** A "hustler" who is incredibly strong and resilient, valuing hard work, purity of intent, honesty in work, dealings with people, and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. Her father and his brothers grew up as the "less affluent" Kapoor family, which instilled in them the need to hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. They are "process driven" rather than outcome driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:29">[01:44:29]</a>.
*   **From her mother (Sridevi Kapoor):** She inherited her mother's "mitochondria" and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. Janhvi shares physical and behavioral similarities with her mother, including how she walks, eats, her voice, and how she cries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. She also believes she is sensitive like her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:16">[01:47:16]</a>. Her mother's art and person were "uncorrupted" because she remained naive and innocent despite years in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:53">[01:49:53]</a>.

## Industry Scrutiny and Public Perception

The host notes that people on the fringes of the industry often avoid acting due to the intense competition and scrutiny faced by those who succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>. There is often a desire for those from privileged backgrounds to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

Despite these [[facing_challenges_and_overcoming_obstacles_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges]], Janhvi expresses a desire for people to "look for the best in people as opposed to being skeptical or pessimistic," hoping that if everyone expects the best, "maybe that's what the world will become" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>. She aims to continue growing through films and experiences, seeking more love from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>.

Dr. Subramanian Swamy, a six-time Member of Parliament and twice a minister, offers a scathing critique of Prime Minister Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government's governance. He highlights issues ranging from honesty and transparency to economic policy and party structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51"></a>.

## Criticisms of PM Modi

Dr. Swamy asserts that PM Modi frequently tells lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>.
Specific examples include:
*   **False claims about Chinese intrusion:** PM Modi claimed that nobody from China had entered Indian territory, which Dr. Swamy disputes, stating that 4,065 square kilometers of undisputed territory in Ladakh have been occupied by China since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57"></a>. He has filed Right to Information (RTI) requests on this matter, which have gone unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54"></a>.
*   **Claiming credit for others' work:** PM Modi is accused of taking credit for achievements he had no part in, such as the Supreme Court clearance for the Ram Mandir project, which Dr. Swamy states he was personally responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32"></a>.
*   **Dishonesty:** Dr. Swamy finds the Prime Minister's dishonesty disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01"></a>.

Furthermore, Dr. Swamy characterizes PM Modi's leadership style as tending towards dictatorship, drawing parallels to figures like Hitler and Putin, who started as democrats but evolved into authoritarian leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18"></a>. He suggests that Modi's actions, including a supposed "fatwa" against him in English newspapers, indicate an attempt to suppress dissenting voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27"></a>. He also views PM Modi as "ungrateful" for the assistance he received before becoming Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32"></a>.

## Criticisms of BJP's Governance and Policy

### [[Corruption and Economic Issues in India | Corruption]]
Dr. Swamy views [[Corruption and Economic Issues in India | corruption]] as a major issue that the BJP government is not adequately addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47"></a>. He differentiates current [[Corruption and Economic Issues in India | corruption]] from past instances, describing it as "plunder" where resources are siphoned off to foreign banks rather than being used for national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10"></a>. He highlights the "mighty scandal" of electoral bonds, where bankrupt companies with "dirty money" allegedly received government contracts after making large payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11"></a>.

### Economic Policies
Dr. Swamy, an economist, is highly critical of the government's economic policies, predicting a "massive depression" in India by 2030 if PM Modi remains in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16"></a>. His specific criticisms include:
*   **Misleading GDP figures:** He claims the reported 8-9% GDP growth rate is bogus and manipulated, largely inflated by including inflation in current prices. He calculates the actual growth rate to be around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05"></a>.
*   **High income tax:** He advocates for abolishing income tax, arguing that the high rates discourage people, are largely collected for the "personal pockets" of officials, and do not contribute to national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33"></a>. He suggests that the middle and upper-middle classes are suffering due to high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37"></a>.
*   **Focus on supply over demand:** The government is criticized for hiking interest rates and not caring about the demand side of the economy, leading to a "supply glut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03"></a>.
*   **Reliance on Nitin Gadkari:** While acknowledging Minister Nitin Gadkari's effectiveness in building [[Challenges in Infrastructure Development in India | roads]], Dr. Swamy suggests that his achievements are often attributed to the "Modi government," and that Gadkari operates despite a lack of direct financial support from the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56"></a>.

### Party Structure and Governance
Dr. Swamy states that the BJP's internal party structure, once based on regular elections and a fine system, has been "thoroughly disrupted by Mr. Modi," with everything now nominated by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32"></a>. He claims that only a few cabinet members, like Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh, possess the spine to speak up, but they are not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13"></a>. There is no healthy team spirit, only a "Modi and then Sano Panza" (Amit Shah) hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06"></a>.

### Foreign Policy
Dr. Swamy criticizes PM Modi's foreign policy, stating that it is entirely based on Modi's will, with no clear stance on non-alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09"></a>. He asserts that Modi has "sold out to the Russians" and "sold out to the Chinese," despite China's aggressive territorial claims in Ladakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56"></a>.

## Outlook on [[Elections and Political Strategy in India | Elections]] and [[Future of Indias democracy | India's Future]]
Dr. Swamy believes the BJP will win the upcoming [[Elections and Political Strategy in India | elections]] based on the [[Public perception and polarization in India | Hindutva]] issue, but he wishes PM Modi would either not contest or lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35"></a>. He views Modi as "not a safe person to be in the prime minister's chair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53"></a>. Despite these criticisms, he remains optimistic about [[Future of Indias democracy | India's future]], asserting that the country has the potential to become the "first factor" globally, provided it achieves consistent 10% annual growth and militarily confronts China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09"></a>. He believes India only needs a leader who empowers people rather than taking all the credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46"></a>.

## Parenting Philosophy: Lessons from a Champion Swimmer's Father

R. Madhavan and his wife, Sarita, hold specific views on parenting, especially concerning their son, Vedaant, a champion swimmer. They are **not pleased** with memes comparing Vedaant to other children in the entertainment industry, viewing such comparisons as potentially hurtful [01:13:49]. They do not endorse or acknowledge these memes, aiming to prevent Vedaant from considering himself inherently "worthy" of all the attention [01:14:14].

Despite Vedaant's achievements, such as national records in his age group, Madhavan emphasizes that Vedaant is not the best swimmer in the country, and many other children his age have achieved more [01:14:41]. He and Sarita actively try to promote other young athletes to ensure a balanced perspective [01:14:39].

The couple believes that early recognition and adulation, while motivating, can be a "double-edged sword" [01:14:09]. They teach Vedaant that if he falters, the backlash could be equally severe compared to someone who isn't a celebrity's child [01:17:33]. Their parenting centers on instilling humility and focusing on future progress rather than dwelling on past achievements [01:19:39]. This approach is described as a "middle class attitude" [01:19:31], emphasizing that dwelling on small accomplishments isn't conducive to long-term success [01:20:39].

## Childhood and the Role of Stress

Madhavan describes his own childhood as "most blessed" despite having "challenges and trauma" [09:48]. He considers childhood stress and trauma "very very important" [09:57]. His own childhood "traumas" included not having a bicycle like his friends, walking to school, waiting for his mother to return home for food, and being compared to other students academically [09:59]. He was even called the "shaitan" (devil) of society for using profanities, climbing trees, and petting street dogs [01:10:37].

He believes that stress is unavoidable and must be embraced [01:11:02]. Avoiding stress can lead to greater problems [01:11:15]. He agrees with the notion that many young people confuse the feeling of stress with hard work [01:11:20]. To achieve goals, one must step out of their [[balancing_professional_life_and_personal_milestones|comfort zone]], a concept Madhavan believes should be removed from life until one is ready to retire [01:11:41]. Overcoming significant challenges makes smaller ones seem irrelevant [01:28:28].

## Generational Differences and Societal Shifts

Madhavan feels sorry for children growing up today compared to his own upbringing in the 1970s [01:21:49]. He cherishes his childhood experiences of climbing trees, catching tadpoles, and navigating fights without parental interference, which fostered skills like swallowing ego and taking a stance [01:22:03]. He attributes the success of many Indian CEOs born in the 70s and 80s to the environment of that era, characterized by scarcity and "middle class humbleness" [01:23:00].

He notes that in the past, issues like mental health were addressed within the family and community, fostering a stronger support system [01:23:17]. The increasing urbanization and cosmopolitanism have led to greater loneliness [01:23:51]. While Gen Z may appear more peaceful and connected globally through technology, Madhavan identifies the "curse" as the **overload of irrelevant information** [01:26:23]. This constant bombardment of trivial news can negatively impact mental health and lead to societal fragmentation and disinterest in broader issues [01:26:52].

He also observes a "push back" from older generations who feel overwhelmed by new societal norms and wish to maintain their accustomed way of life [01:29:11]. This cultural shift contributes to feelings of loneliness among those in their 40s, as their established conditioning clashes with evolving social expectations [01:31:37].

## Dealing with Aging Parents

Madhavan observes that many people in their 40s and 50s struggle with [[balancing_family_responsibilities_and_career|aging parents]] [01:09:59]. He highlights that for aging parents, their children become their primary source of happiness, relevance, and importance [01:10:51]. The parents' health is often directly linked to their happiness, which in turn is tied to their offspring [01:11:08]. A significant fear for today's elderly is becoming dependent on others [01:12:01].

He stresses the **importance of blessing from elders**, considering it a powerful, agenda-free force [01:12:58]. He makes an extra effort to be affectionate and respectful to all seniors, whether related or not, believing their blessings are immensely beneficial [01:13:05].

### The Emotional Toll of Caregiving
Madhavan acknowledges the [[dealing_with_failures_and_life_challenges|heartbreaking difficulty]] of putting on a brave face while witnessing a parent's health decline, such as [[dealing_with_cancer|dementia]] in his own father's case [01:13:53]. He questions why such stimuli visit life's process but ultimately accepts it without questioning [01:14:10].

### Cultural Dynamics of Care
He notes that in Indian culture, the expectation of caring for parents is ingrained from the beginning, unlike in Western cultures where children often move out at 17 [01:14:50]. This intrinsic cultural value means that caring for parents is seen as a "job" that is "embied as a culture" [01:15:10].

### The Role of Grandchildren
A significant observation Madhavan makes is the unique bond between grandparents and grandchildren [01:19:42]. He explains that once parents become adolescents, their parents often stop hugging them due to societal norms [01:19:32]. It is only when a child has their own offspring that grandparents can publicly express physical affection, as the grandchild is the "only next close thing to blood that they can hug" [01:19:46]. This highlights the deep, unspoken need for physical connection that grandchildren often fulfill for the elderly.

Following a consistent [[basic_skincare_routine_for_different_skin_types | basic skincare routine]] can help prevent issues like acne, blemishes, skin bumps, and irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This [[indian_skincare_recommendations_and_product_suggestions | Indian skincare routine]] is applicable for all skin types, including [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | oily skin]], dry skin, and regular skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Face Washing Routine

### Frequency
Wash your face a minimum of twice a day: once before bed and once in the morning after waking up, or upon reaching your office or college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If you sweat a lot from cardio, playing sports like football or cricket, you can wash your face a third time after coming home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Ideally, stick to twice a day, and only go for a third wash on occasional cardio days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Choosing a Face Wash
Always use a 100% [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | herbal face wash]] if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Many big brands claim to be Ayurvedic but may only contain Ayurvedic ingredients, not be entirely herbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Some recommended [[indian_skincare_recommendations_and_product_suggestions | natural/herbal face wash brands]] include:
*   **Khadi** (budget-friendly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   **K Aura** and **Forest Essentials** (more expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

### Application Technique
The face wash routine applies universally, whether using a herbal, chemical, or mild face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
1.  **Timing:** It is preferable to wash your face after shaving or showering, as pores are slightly opened, allowing the face wash to clean and close them more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Herbal face washes also add nutrition to the skin, similar to how the body absorbs nutrition from food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Amount:** Take a coin-sized portion of face wash or gel (e.g., aloe vera gel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  **Rubbing:** Rub the product all over your hands before applying it to your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
4.  **Target Areas and Motion:**
    *   **Cheeks:** Apply in a circular motion for about 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Chin and Neck:** Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **T-Area (forehead, nose, chin):** Apply in a circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   The circular motion increases blood flow, which rejuvenates the skin, promotes growth, and helps clean dirt better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
5.  **Pressure:** Be gentle but firm with your strokes, avoiding pressing too hard or too lightly to prevent skin damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
6.  **Sitting Time (Herbal):** If using a herbal face wash, let it sit on your face for about a minute to allow it to work its magic before washing it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. A normal mild face wash can be washed off immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Rinsing
Do not wash your face with hot or freezing cold water, as both can damage your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Use room temperature or tepid (slightly warmer than room temperature, but not hot) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Moisturizing with Natural Products

[[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | Natural moisturizers]] are recommended as [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | chemically made moisturizers]] can clog pores, increase [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | acne]], and destroy beneficial bacteria on the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Tools and Key Ingredients
*   **Cotton Balls:** Always use clean cotton balls to apply moisturizers, as hands can carry dirty bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Rose Water:** A disinfectant, it can be applied twice a day: once before heading out and once at night before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Khadi is a recommended brand, but rose water products are widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Lime Juice:** Squeeze half a lime into a bowl, soak a cotton swab, and apply. Use no more than once or twice a week as it is stronger than rose water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Fights [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | acne]] and helps fade blemishes/acne marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Sensation:** It may cause a stinging sensation, which indicates it's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If too strong, mix with a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Aloe Vera:** Considered a powerful moisturizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   **Application:** Tear open a leaf, squeeze or scrape out the pulp, and apply the gel onto your face, possibly mixed with lime water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Ideal for extremely [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | dry skin]] or very bad [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | acne]], used once or twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Anti-Acne Products

While natural moisturizers offer long-term [[skin_care_routine_for_oily_skin_and_acne_prevention | anti-acne]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, short-term solutions are needed for active, painful pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Natural Herbal Oils
Prioritize [[natural_versus_chemical_skincare_products | natural herbal oils]] over antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Unlike dense oils like coconut oil which can clog pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, these are low-density skin oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Sweet almond oil, rosehip oil, or tea tree oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Function:** They are absorbed by the pimple, reducing inflammation and redness, and helping it heal faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Antibiotics (Use with Caution)
Antibiotics like Clinda (a tube available at general stores) can be used, but overuse can destroy beneficial bacteria on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Always try low-density oils first, and only turn to antibiotics if natural oils don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Lifestyle Factors for Skin Health

Diet and [[diet_lifestyle_and_stress_management_for_skincare | lifestyle factors]] significantly impact skin health and the effectiveness of [[skincare_routines_for_different_skin_types | skincare routines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Diet
*   **Avoid:** Sugar, junk food, hotel food, and packaged fried snacks (especially those with refined flour or trans fats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Include:** More vegetables and fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Moderation:** Avoid overdoing one particular type of food, such as non-vegetarian items, eggs, or single vegetarian protein sources like paneer or soya chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Stress Management
High stress levels elevate cortisol, a hormone that negatively affects skin quality, aging, and can cause sebaceous (oil) glands to secrete more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Reduce Cortisol:** Focus on sleep hygiene (quality of sleep) and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Both can reduce stress and improve skin quality overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

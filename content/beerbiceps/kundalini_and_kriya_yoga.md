Shri M, a renowned author and spiritual leader, delves into the concepts of Kriya Yoga and Kundalini, explaining their significance in spiritual advancement and human existence. He emphasizes the practical aspects and the profound impact these practices have on one's perception of reality and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.

## Kriya Yoga
Kriya is a term found in the Shastras and Yoga Shastras that simply means "a practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. The specific Kriya teachings Shri M refers to originated from Sri Guru Babaji, who is considered the master of Shri M's own guru, Maheswar Babaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. This Sri Guru Babaji is the person Yogananda Swami first coined the word "Mahavatar Babaji" for, noting that he has been present for a long time and is supposed to remain until the end of the Kali Yuga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. In many traditions, he is known as Sri Guru Babaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

The purpose of Mahavatar Babaji was to reintroduce Kriya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. It is described as a step-by-step, systematic, and methodical way of transcending the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Kriya Yoga is widely considered one of the fastest forms of spiritual advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Practices and Requirements
For Kriya to be effective, it requires adherence to "Yamas" (rules and regulations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. The efficacy also depends on the diligence and care with which one practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

Kriya fundamentally works by raising awareness from the gross to the subtle, with particular attention to the spine, known as *Sushumna* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. The mind, typically caught up in gross forms of energy, is guided to subtler levels by moving awareness through different parts of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. This process refines the mind until it can discern the origin of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

A simple meditation technique, echoing [[Krishnas Teachings and Philosophy | Krishna's teachings]] in the sixth chapter of the Gita (Dhyana Yoga), involves sitting straight with a steady spine and head, fixing attention between the eyebrows (the *Bhrumadhya*), balancing the breath, and becoming free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

### Benefits and Outcomes
Through consistent practice, Shri M states that it opens up many dimensions to the mind, allowing consciousness to be shifted from lower to higher levels at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. In the Indian system of thought, when the mind is free, it reflects Divinity, which is not an external concept but the divine spark within us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

## Kundalini

Shri M advises caution with the term "Kundalini" due to its exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. He explains that [[Tantra and its Practices | Tantra]] has two main sections:
1.  **Mantra section**: Deals with mantras, such as Sri Vidya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.
2.  **Yoga Tantras**: Address the energy within the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

The word Kundalini, or *Kundalini Shakthi*, in the Tantras, refers to the entire energy of the universe, which is complete, or *parashakthi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. This feminine creative energy initially operates through sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. It is responsible for creating another human being, residing at the base of the spine in the *Muladhara*, the lowest chakra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

A yogi's practice involves controlling this energy and turning it upwards to ascend the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. When it ascends, Kundalini (or Shakthi) transforms into a spiritually creative energy, analogous to its physical creative role through sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. Kriya is one of the practices from the [[The practice of Tantra and its different paths | Yoga Tantra]] tradition designed to achieve this upward redirection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. A combination of Kriya and *Mantra Tantra* (using chants like *vidya upasana*) is considered ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

### Pace of Awakening
The time it takes for Kundalini to awaken and ascend varies greatly, depending on one's stage of spiritual growth and past [[Karmic lessons and reincarnation | karmic predispositions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. Diligent practice with the intention to rise above the ordinary is key, and the process can continue into future lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

It is generally preferable for the awakening to occur slowly and maturely rather than suddenly, as the energy is incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Sudden, unprepared awakenings can lead to psychological distress, causing the individual to behave strangely or feel "possessed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. The body and mind need to mature to cope with the impact of this arousal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

## Kundalini and Enlightenment
According to the Yoga Shastras, Kundalini awakening or Moksha (liberation/enlightenment) typically occurs when the energy has risen to the *Sahasrara* (crown chakra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. However, Shri M acknowledges that some individuals achieve illumination without consciously practicing Kriya Yoga or other specific yoga forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. This happens due to their minds becoming purified over many lives, and the energy may awaken in other centers, like the heart (*Anahata*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

While [[Tantric concepts and practices | Tantric concepts and practices]] are often associated with sex, Shri M clarifies that the connection stems from Kundalini being the same energy that operates through sexual excitement and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

## The Role of a Guru
A stable and experienced guru is essential for teaching these profound practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. The guru must also be able to follow through and provide guidance, especially since these practices venture into largely unexplored territory with potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. Shri M himself learned from his guru, Maheswar Babaji, who taught him various schools of philosophy and practices, including Kriya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

A true and unfiltered desire for a guru will lead to the teacher appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. However, the student must also sincerely want it, reaching a point where they feel they cannot proceed without a proper guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. A guru may leave once their function is complete, and it is acceptable for students to change gurus if it aids their spiritual progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

In contemporary society, the nature of intimacy has significantly evolved, largely due to its increased accessibility and convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This ease of access, however, appears to create a paradox where individuals become increasingly hesitant to commit to genuine, long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Paradox of Accessible Intimacy

The availability of intimacy "whenever they want it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> makes people "too scared to commit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This convenience can intimidate individuals, ultimately preventing them from forming "a real equation with anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Actress Janhvi Kapoor articulated this view, suggesting that for many in her generation, the very accessibility of intimacy leads to a reluctance to engage in deeper, more committed [[relationships_and_the_idea_of_marriage | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

> "Intimacy has become so accessible that... it's very convenient to get it whenever they want it and then and that also makes people too scared to commit to it... they're too intimidated by intimacy and they also have access to it at their convenience which which keeps them away from ever forming a real equation with anyone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>

This perspective suggests that while physical or superficial intimacy may be readily available, the effort and vulnerability required for deep, emotional connection are increasingly avoided.

## Loneliness Amidst Connectivity

Despite being a public figure and a self-proclaimed "feeler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a> and empath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, Janhvi Kapoor openly admits to experiencing loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This highlights a broader issue: even with widespread connectivity and accessible forms of interaction, genuine emotional connection can be elusive, leading to feelings of isolation. Her current focus is on personal and professional [[The impact of relationships on personal growth | growth]] rather than romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, implying a guarded approach to her personal life.

## The Influence of Social Media

The prevalence of [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_changing_societal_norms | social media]] and short-form content has also contributed to a general decrease in attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. While not directly about intimacy, this shift in consumption habits can indirectly affect how individuals engage with sustained emotional connection, potentially reinforcing a preference for transient interactions over deep, time-intensive relationships.

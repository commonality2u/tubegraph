This article provides a comprehensive overview of World War II, examining its origins, key events, and lasting [[geopolitical_impact_of_world_war_2_on_modern_times | geopolitical impact]]. The discussion highlights the interconnectedness of historical events, the evolution of warfare, and the underlying human motivations that drive conflict.

## Origins of World War II

The events of the two World Wars established the geopolitical chessboard for the Cold War and subsequent global developments, with everything seen today being a consequence of the 30-year period encompassing both World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. These conflicts are referred to as the "European Tribal Wars" due to their European origins and historical grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### World War I: The Great War

World War I, initially called the Great War, began in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Its causes trace back to the 19th century and Europe's history of conflict driven by territory and power among feudal lords, kings, and emperors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Before the Industrial Revolution, power stemmed from land ownership and agricultural produce, with peasants paying taxes and serving armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The Industrial Revolution shifted wealth to industries concentrated in urban centers, shaking up the old power structure and leading to conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### Technological and Military Developments (WWI)

[[technological_advancements_during_world_war_2 | Technology]] significantly shaped up during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. New weapons were introduced, including chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Airplanes evolved from reconnaissance tools to platforms equipped with machine guns and bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Tanks were first introduced in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Many wartime [[technological_advancements_during_world_war_2 | technologies]] eventually found civilian applications, with military technology typically preceding civilian release by 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Escalation of Conflict

Europe was a tinderbox of old rivalries, ethnic enmities, and feuds between dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo sparked the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, Russia allied with Serbia, and Germany greenlit Austria-Hungary's war on Serbia in July 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Germany then declared war on Russia and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Due to strong French fortifications, Germany invaded through Luxembourg and Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Britain, having assured Belgium's neutrality, intervened, sending troops to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

The German Schlieffen Plan aimed to advance through Belgium and Luxembourg to invade France and capture Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Fierce Belgian and British resistance led to the Battle of the Marne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. This resulted in prolonged trench warfare on the Western Front, with trenches extending from the North Sea to Switzerland, characterized by horrific conditions, dead bodies, rats, and disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

On the Eastern Front, the Ottoman Empire allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary, declaring war on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Their attempt to invade Russia in the Caucasus region failed disastrously due to freezing temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. British forces, including an Indian expeditionary force, landed in Kuwait to take Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), which also ended in disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. Italy joined the Allies, fighting Austria-Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

### Global Involvement (WWI)

The conflict became internationalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Approximately 1.5 million Indian soldiers fought for the British in this war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Other European powers also brought their colonies into play; the French recruited about a million African soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. German colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific Islands were also involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Japan, allied with Britain, took German islands and positions in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. Naval battles extended to South America, near the Falkland Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

Germany pioneered undersea warfare with U-boats, countering a British naval blockade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. German U-boats sank American supply ships, eventually drawing the US into the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. The US supplied the Allied Powers with arms, ammunition, and food, making Britain heavily indebted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>.

### Aftermath of World War I

The Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary surrendered, followed by Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. The Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 led to Russia's withdrawal from the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. The Treaty of Versailles formally ended the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. The Ottoman Empire was dismantled, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken into new states like Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovak Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Germany lost significant territory, and Poland was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. Germany was solely blamed and forced to pay heavy reparations, causing national humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

The Treaty of Versailles was effectively a 20-year ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. The US emerged as the major economic power globally after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

### Rise of Dictatorships and Precursors to WWII

The German economy suffered hyperinflation due to reparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 further impacted the German economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. In the 1920s, Benito Mussolini's fascist party rose to power in Italy, leading to a one-party dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Italy felt humiliated and gained little from World War I, fostering discontent and nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>.

Adolf Hitler, an Austrian soldier who fought for Germany in World War I, carried the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. In the 1930s, his National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, blaming the Weimar Republic for economic ills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Hitler rapidly became an undisputed leader, breaking the Treaty of Versailles by remilitarizing, reintroducing conscription, and boosting arms production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. He propagated a mythology of a "master race" and the concept of "lebensraum" (living space) for the German people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. The Nazis adopted the "hakenkreuz" (hooked cross) as their symbol, distinct from the ancient, auspicious Indian swastika <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49:00">[44:49:00]</a>. The term "Aryan," meaning noble in Indian culture, was hijacked and twisted by Hitler to denote a superior, white German race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>.

Germany expanded by reunifying with Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>, then taking Czech territory (Sudetenland) with weak protests from Britain and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Czechoslovakia was later absorbed, making the Slovak Republic a satellite state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:24:00]</a>. In 1938 or 1939, Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Stalin (the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact), secretly agreeing to divide Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

## Chronology of World War II

### Invasion of Poland and European Conquest

The German invasion of Poland in 1939, with half taken by Germany and the other half by the USSR, triggered declarations of war from Britain and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. Germany employed the "Blitzkrieg" (lightning warfare) strategy, concentrating firepower to punch through enemy defenses with lightning speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. This strategy, combined with their advanced Air Force (Luftwaffe) and Panzer tanks, allowed rapid territorial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>.

German forces quickly overran Belgium and the Netherlands, pushing British troops to Dunkirk, leading to their evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. France rapidly fell, with northern and western France occupied and the southern half controlled by the Vichy government, a Nazi puppet state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>. Yugoslavia and the Balkan region also quickly fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:03:00">[55:03:00]</a>. After conquering most of Europe, Germany and Italy turned their attention to Britain in the Battle of Britain, characterized by massive aerial battles and bombardments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:28:00">[55:28:00]</a>. Germany also pioneered the use of V1 cruise missiles and V2 ballistic missiles to attack British cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a>.

### Invasion of the Soviet Union

In 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, a massive invasion of the USSR, catching Stalin by tactical surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[56:41:00]</a>. The German army advanced rapidly, losing 3 million Russian soldiers in the first few months, but the Soviets had a vast reserve of 14-15 million trained men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>. Despite Stalin's purges depleting top military ranks, Russian soldiers fought fiercely for "Mother Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:37:00">[58:37:00]</a>. Hitler's decision to divert forces south to capture Ukraine's resources instead of pushing directly for Moscow was a major strategic mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:39:00">[59:39:00]</a>. While the Germans reached within 20 kilometers of Moscow, they were halted by the fierce Russian resistance and the brutal Russian winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:55:00">[59:55:00]</a>.

In 1942, another German advance southward towards the Caucasus led to the Battle of Stalingrad, a disastrous siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. The siege of Leningrad (St. Petersburg) lasted 870 days, resulting in over a million civilian deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. The Russian Army, not the winter, ultimately defeated the Germans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

### The Pacific Theater

Simultaneously, Japan had been active in Asia, conquering Manchuria in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>. After a defeat against the USSR army in Mongolia in 1939, Japan shifted its focus to Southeast Asia, conquering Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, and reaching India's doorstep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>. Japan took over eastern parts of China, committing atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>. The Japanese military, influenced by a 19th-century reformation, became an expansionist power, conducting horrific experiments on human beings, including exposure to extreme cold and pathogen injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.

The US imposed an oil and steel blockade on Japan, leading to Japan's retaliatory attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, significantly damaging the American Pacific Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. This forced the US to enter the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. The initial US campaign involved island hopping in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

### Allied Victory

The Allies landed in Sicily, Italy, then advanced into Southern Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. When the Italian government sought a ceasefire, Germany invaded Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. The tide turned decisively with the invasion of Normandy (D-Day), a massive naval invasion force that landed on the beaches of Normandy, establishing a foothold in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. This American and British presence, bolstered by significant troops, arms, and ammunition, led to the liberation of France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The USSR, pushing westward, liberated all of Eastern Europe from the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

By 1945, the Soviets were on the outskirts of Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The official narrative states that Hitler shot himself, and his wife took a poison pill, though photographic evidence of his death is lacking, leading to speculation that he might have escaped to South America like many other Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. The Israeli Mossad later hunted down and captured Nazis who had escaped, including Adolf Eichmann in Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.

In the Pacific, the Americans launched an intense bombardment campaign on Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Despite months of bombardment and Soviet advances into Japanese-held territories like Sakhalin Peninsula and Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>, Japan refused to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>. The US, developing the atom bomb through the Manhattan Project, tested the Trinity bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Ultimately, the US dropped two nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.

## Impact and Aftermath

### Geopolitical Realignments

The end of World War II led to significant [[geopolitical_impact_of_world_war_2_on_modern_times | geopolitical realignments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The Korean Peninsula was divided between Soviet and American influence, leading to North and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. Germany was divided into East and West Germany, leading to the rapid emergence of the Iron Curtain and the beginning of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>.

European powers like the UK and France were weakened, becoming second-tier powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>. The US emerged as the undisputed global power, inheriting the Anglo-Saxon Empire's influence from London to Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. The US's strategic geographical position, vast resources, and ability to indebt European nations contributed to its dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Oceans and their choke points became critical to global geopolitics, controlling trade and energy routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. The US also engaged in "debt trap diplomacy," a strategy later adopted by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.

### Human Cost and Atrocities

World War II was characterized by unimaginable human suffering and atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The Holocaust, with 6 million Jews killed, was one of the many horrific acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The war saw the worst phase of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Role of Media and Propaganda

The [[role_of_media_and_propaganda_during_and_after_the_world_wars | role of media and propaganda]] was crucial in shaping narratives, with the victors writing history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Western media is often seen as propagating state-approved perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. For example, while Hitler is demonized, other figures like Stalin and Mao, who killed more people, or Winston Churchill, who was responsible for millions of Indian deaths, are not portrayed with the same level of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Had Hitler sided with the US, his image might have been different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Indian Involvement and Colonization

The [[influence_of_colonization_on_indian_history | influence of colonization on Indian history]] is evident in World War II, with over a million Indian troops fighting for the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose allied with Germany and Japan, forming the Indian National Army (INA) from Indian prisoners of war, to fight against the British for India's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>. The INA advanced into Eastern India, participating in battles like Imphal and Kohima, but was eventually driven back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. The British deliberately starved over 100 million Indians through engineered famines from the 1700s to the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

### Formation of the United Nations

As World War II ended, the United Nations (UN) was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>. Membership was open to countries that declared war on Germany before March 1, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. The victorious powers became the permanent members of the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>. India was offered a permanent position but declined, with Jawaharlal Nehru advocating for China instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

### Cycles of Conflict

Human history is inherently violent, driven by strong personalities and a desire for territory, resources, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. These geopolitical cycles of conflict never end, as seen from the end of WWI leading to WWII, and WWII leading to the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. The 2020s are marked by rapid geopolitical change, with potential for new conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

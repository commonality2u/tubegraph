Major Vivek Jacob is regarded by many Indians as a legendary modern-day figure in the Indian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is a veteran of the Indian Paras SF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, which is considered the most advanced part of the Indian Army and one of the most respected regiments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | experiences of combat]], its intensity, and the extreme situations he has witnessed are profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining the Special Forces Mindset

The [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | Special Forces mindset]] is fundamentally about an "exploratory spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, where individuals are willing to constantly explore and put everything they have, including their lives and attachments, on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This spirit drives them to know and explore more, leading to extreme situations where they constantly place their lives on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The core of this mindset is a "spirit to be free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Major Jacob categorizes human consciousness into three levels: a follower, a leader, and an explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Special Forces individuals embody the exploratory spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. At various stages of life, people function within these three spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The shifts in one's level of perception—both external and internal—determine one's functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## The Selection and Training Process

The [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process | selection and training process]] for Special Forces is designed to be incredibly intense, shattering one's ego and preconceived perceptions of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. This full spectrum of physical, mental, and emotional energy is expended to reveal what lies beneath and determine if an individual has the trust and ability to perform in [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Volunteering and Initial Filtration
The first filtration begins with volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. It requires courage to volunteer for Special Forces, especially after years of training in academies like NDA and IMA, as failure carries significant social and personal disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. Those who volunteer demonstrate a desire to go "one level higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Upon joining a Special Forces unit, life immediately shifts; everything is stripped away, from ego to personal belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Dual Process of Breaking Down and Training
The training environment is purposefully built to break and teach recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. It's a dual process of being "broken down, shattered, torn apart" while simultaneously being trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This process fosters efficiency, requiring recruits to either quickly adapt or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

Recruits are taught essential skill sets for combat, including:
*   Explosive training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>
*   Unarmed combat training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   Weapon training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>
*   Endurance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   Navigation training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>
*   Emergency medical first response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   Survival training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>

This training occurs under constant, extreme pressure, often with little to no sleep for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Major Jacob recounts his own [[experiences_of_major_vivek_jacob_in_the_indian_special_forces | experience]] of being grilled daily at the officer's mess, having to memorize intricate details of the unit's history, trophies, and stories of fallen heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Failing to answer questions would lead to exhausting punishments, such as circling the battalion all night while still being expected to excel in physical tests against well-rested peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The purpose is to see if a recruit can perform under immense duress and make choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

This rigorous [[indian_special_forces_selection_and_training_process | selection process]] determines whether a candidate will "stick or run" in a chaotic combat situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. Those who remain are individuals who are already at a high level of consciousness, capable of making their own choices and sticking by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

## Impact of Training and Combat

The [[psychological_and_mental_training_in_the_armed_forces | psychological and mental training]] during selection helps individuals realize their true capabilities, leading to the profound realization that "nothing is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. This realization becomes the "chief weapon" of a Special Forces operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

However, no training can fully replicate the reality of [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | Combat]] further "tears you up" and places an operator in the "right mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. It is a constant exposure to the "cutting edge" of life and death, leading to continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This extreme environment hones [[understanding_consciousness_and_intuition_in_military_scenarios | intuition]] to such a powerful degree that operators can often predict events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

## First Combat Experience and Instinct

Major Jacob recounts his first [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]] experience after probation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. Despite being ordered to stay back, he instinctively followed his team into a dangerous ravine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. When bullets started flying, it was "pure instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Years of rigorous weapon training, including sleeping with his AK-47, had made it "part of my body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. In the chaos of [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]], efficiency comes to the forefront; there is no time for precise aiming, only instinctive, decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

## Leadership and Brotherhood in Combat

Leadership in Special Forces is defined by responsibility—the ability to take on that responsibility and trust oneself to do so, especially when lives are at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. While formal ranks exist, in [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]], there is no authority based on rank; true leadership emerges from action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The Special Forces operate like brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>, bound by trust which then develops into love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This love is crucial for survival and efficiency in chaotic situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

> "what exists only that exists in combat is Love Is Love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

Major Jacob recalls an ambush where the entire team was pinned down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. In that moment of intense machine gun fire, he realized that "the man who stands now and returns fire he's the leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. He stood up and fired back, prompting others to follow, thereby controlling the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. Leadership is not earned, but simply "who you are" when chaos hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Personal Choice

The most challenging [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]] experience for Major Jacob was when one of his men was severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. Despite the dire situation, the team, driven by love and trust, acted with immense clarity and efficiency, performing emergency medical care and extracting the injured soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. The injured soldier's own stoicism and desire to walk, despite a blown-off leg, exemplified the shared mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

Major Jacob also describes a rare instance of experiencing "dread" during a prolonged, multi-day operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This feeling, unprecedented in his 12 years of [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]], led him to question his desire to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. However, he crushed the feeling and stayed, and soon after, the expected chaos erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. This experience underscores the constant internal processing and the absolute necessity of self-trust and the ability to make a choice in the face of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

Major Jacob attributes his survival and the fact that he was never hit in [[challenges_and_philosophies_of_being_a_soldier_in_combat | combat]] to a "choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Despite constant chaos, explosions, and being surrounded by enemies, he always emerged unscathed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. His entire life has flashed before his eyes three times in such moments, demonstrating the extreme [[the_spiritual_and_psychological_aspects_of_military_life | spiritual and psychological aspects of military life]] at the cutting edge of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

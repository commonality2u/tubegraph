Bollywood actress [[Janhvi Kapoors personal exploration and insecurities | Janhvi Kapoor]] has expressed her beliefs in the existence of ghosts and the lingering energy of deceased individuals. She believes that when a person dies, they inevitably leave behind traces of their energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Types of Spiritual Entities

Janhvi acknowledges that not all spiritual entities are malevolent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. She notes that the nature of a ghost can vary based on the person's personality and how they died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. For instance, if someone died in anger or felt they were killed prematurely, their ghostly presence might be filled with aggression, constantly trying to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Personal Paranormal Experiences

Janhvi Kapoor has experienced several [[ghostly_experiences_and_paranormal_investigations | paranormal incidents]] throughout her life.

### Childhood Sleep Paralysis

At 11 years old, while sleeping next to her mother, Janhvi experienced an intense [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | sleep paralysis]] episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. During this experience, she felt a figure sitting on her, staring with one eye, with half its head covered and pale skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. Her mother had previously advised her to recite a mantra if such an event occurred, and upon reciting it, the experience faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

Years later, around the age of 12 or 13, Janhvi saw an enactment of an alien abduction on a show that recreated the exact figure she had seen during her sleep paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. This chilling confirmation deeply affected her and caused her mother to believe her experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Encounter at Work Space

Approximately four years prior to this discussion, Janhvi and her first teammate, during a late-night meditation session in their office garage, both felt a strong, intense presence in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Janhvi believes that deep meditations can push out negative energies from spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

After this incident, Janhvi contacted a friend whom she strongly believes is [[psychic_abilities_and_astral_travel_experiences | psychic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This friend visited the office and immediately identified the specific area of the building, directly below Janhvi's mother's room where the childhood incident occurred, as having been intensely haunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. The psychic friend explained that the haunting originated from before the building was constructed and that meditation likely pushed it away, though traces might remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. He provided Janhvi with specific chants, similar to exorcism rituals, to manage any lingering presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

Junior teammates who have stayed at the office have also reported seeing a woman running around at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

## Empaths and Healing Energies

Janhvi believes that empaths possess healing energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. She suggests that during periods of emotional angst, empaths might attract entities from the other realm that need to be healed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. She humorously states that she "only attract[s] things that need to be healed" and is "sick of it," implying this extends to her [[Janhvi Kapoor discussing her love life and relationships | romantic life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

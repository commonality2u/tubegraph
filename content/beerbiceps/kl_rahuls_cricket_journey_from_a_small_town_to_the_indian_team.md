KL Rahul's journey in cricket is a testament to self-belief and perseverance, originating from a small town without a strong cricketing legacy to becoming a prominent figure in the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Humble Beginnings and Aspiring Dreams
Hailing from Mangalore, a small town, KL Rahul notes a significant difference in his upbringing compared to peers who grew up in major cities like Bombay with readily available sporting heroes like Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He emphasizes that there were no sporting heroes in his hometown to look up to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite this, his sole plan from a young age was to play for India, without a "plan B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. He started playing cricket at 11 years old, dedicating almost all his time to the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Reflecting on his success, he often pinches himself, wondering how he achieved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Growing Up in the Public Eye
As a cricketer, KL Rahul has [[the_mind_of_a_cricketer_and_life_off_the_field | grown up in front of the world]], with every action, movement, and word being judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This constant scrutiny puts immense pressure on players to behave in a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. He acknowledges making mistakes, both in public relations and in his craft, as is common for individuals in their 20s and early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

In his early career, there wasn't much guidance on handling the pressure of international or IPL cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He largely had to [[personal_growth_and_life_lessons_from_cricket | learn it himself]] through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He observes that while senior players share their experiences, many cricketers learn through their own journey, making mistakes before realizing the wisdom of prior advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The pressure of performance means that good results lead to different treatment, and it's easy to get "sucked into all of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He admitted to losing his true personality while growing up in the spotlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Managing Social Media and Public Opinion
KL Rahul is acutely aware of the online trolling, hate, and criticism that accompanies his profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. His friend, Ishant Sharma, advised him early in his career to stay away from social media, regardless of performance, to maintain neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. While the love from fans can be empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, he believes it's essential to avoid both excessive praise and criticism to stay balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He personally tries to stay away from reading about himself for mental peace, allowing him to focus on what's important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. He emphasizes that players truly need support, and it's unfair to assume they aren't serious or working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Key to Success: Self-Belief and Mentorship
When asked about the most important quality that helped him make it to the Indian team, KL Rahul immediately pointed to "self-belief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. He describes the journey to the top as "quite lonely" due to constant competition for spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

He credits Rahul Dravid as his biggest cricket mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Rahul grew up watching Dravid and later had the opportunity to train and play with him in Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This was his first chance to interact with an international cricketer and someone he idolized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Financial Stability
KL Rahul views gaining financial stability as a significant turning point, allowing him to entirely focus his energy on becoming a better cricketer and athlete without worrying about earning a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. He notes that while his initial big contract led to some "bonkers" spending, he quickly learned to be smarter about managing his money, investing, and considering his future outside of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

## Leadership and Future Aspirations
Having captained in the IPL and for India, KL Rahul sees [[learning_leadership_and_captaincy_in_cricket | leadership]] as a continuous journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. He believes a captain is only as good as his team, emphasizing the importance of getting everyone on the same page and building relationships so players are willing to "fight for you on the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. This was initially challenging for him as he is a reserved person who doesn't like intruding on others' space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

He has learned from exceptional leaders he has played under:
*   **MS Dhoni**: Taught him the importance of building relationships with each person, creating a bond where players would "take a bullet" for their captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Dhoni's calm demeanor and ability to understand each individual's personal and game-related thoughts allowed him to get the best out of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. Dhoni's strong intuition and unwavering trust in his gut feelings, even if unorthodox, were also key to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: Inspired the team with his passion and aggression, setting high standards and leading from the front to achieve greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Kohli empowered players to push themselves beyond mediocrity, focusing on fitness, diet, and other small details that led to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Rohit Sharma**: Praised for his strategic sharpness and extensive homework before games, knowing each person's strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Rohit's relaxed demeanor comes from his thorough preparation and confidence in having answers to any moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

KL Rahul's own leadership philosophy is to remain true to himself as a captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. He recognizes that behaving differently in a leadership role can inadvertently pressure teammates to conform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. He aims to be a leader who empowers others to be comfortable in their own skin, whether they are aggressive or quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

He views his journey as divinely guided, acknowledging that it wouldn't have been possible without "someone on top really looking out for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. He feels a sense of pride in having achieved his dreams in a country where so many play cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The discussion on [[interaction with spirits and entities | interaction with higher beings and entities]] delves into the nature of spiritual beings, their planes of existence, and how humans can encounter them, both positively and negatively. This episode is the finale of a trilogy exploring Tantra and the [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | Occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, aiming to educate about darker concepts in ancient Indian culture while promoting spiritual growth towards goodness and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Spiritual Protection and Growth
Meditation and spiritualization are key to protecting oneself from darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Starting a meditation journey is encouraged to achieve mental stability and protection in dark moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The more one meditates and becomes spiritualized, the greater the ability to self-protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Nature of Beings and Planes of Existence
Tantric practitioners possess an intimate understanding of [[Higher beings and other realms | higher beings]] and [[interaction with spirits and entities | entities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The [[Higher beings and other realms | astral plane]] and the physical plane coexist in the same space, overlapping, but humans cannot typically perceive the astral plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Beyond the astral is the causal plane, which is much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

### Types of Entities

Entities are broadly categorized by their nature, power, and potential influence:

*   **Bhoot (Discarnate Entities)**
    *   Entities without a physical body, some of whom were once human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
    *   They possess human-like tendencies such as hunger, anger, or lust, and may remain trapped on this plane, unable to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
    *   Their agitation can cause trouble to those nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
    *   Sometimes, [[Spirits and their awareness in the afterlife | spirits and their awareness in the afterlife]] may not immediately realize they are discarnate, leading to shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
    *   Ancestors (*pitrus*) who are stuck in the astral plane (pitru loka) may unconsciously project their problems onto living descendants due to genetic connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Specific rituals and pilgrimages to certain temples can help pacify these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Pret (Angry Spirits)**
    *   More dangerous and very angry spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
    *   They could be formerly human beings in a very negative state due to twisted karmas, or even criminals or tantrics who died violently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.
    *   Violent or non-conventional deaths (e.g., accidental death at a young age, suicide) can result in a soul becoming a pret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
    *   They cause trouble like diseases, obstructions, and accidents to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. They also cause things to turn negative despite one's best efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.
    *   Hauntings in horror movies often fall into the categories of pret or pishach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Pishach (Extremely Dangerous Entities)**
    *   More dangerous than prets, akin to a "mad bull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.
    *   Many pishachas have never incarnated as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.
    *   *Brahma Pishacha* refers to highly knowledgeable spiritual individuals who misused or withheld knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
    *   They are unreasonable and irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, confined to specific areas of extreme negative energy, often with foul odors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
    *   They aim to influence and gain attention by causing disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.
    *   Believed to be a broad category that includes *jinn* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.
*   **Rakshasa and Asura (Highest Negative Entities)**
    *   Rakshasas are mentioned in ancient texts like the Ramayana and Mahabharata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
    *   Asuras are the highest of negative entities in Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   They are extremely powerful, like gods but in a negative sense, and rarely incarnate physically in the current era due to humans' limited capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.
    *   Asuras are intelligent, masters of logic and intellect, and are not atheists; they know and even worship deities but misuse their powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
    *   Their influence is primarily mental, affecting people's minds from their own planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. Sri Aurobindo believed Hitler was influenced by an Asura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
    *   Wealth can attract [[Higher beings and other realms | Asuric influences]], leading individuals to engage in unrighteous actions to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

## Encounters and Experiences
Rajash Nandi recounts a personal [[interaction with spirits and entities | experience]] where he encountered two entities, one negative and one cold evil, after undergoing a period of intense negative thoughts and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. These entities were causing the mental turmoil and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He used Mantra sadhana and a fire ritual to the deity Matara, whom he worshipped, to gain detachment and perceive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

He also shares a transformative [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | experience]] from his college days, where he saw the deity Durga during a puja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. This led him to a guru who revealed unknown details about his life, leading him to undertake a mantra chanting practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. After 41 days of practice, he experienced the presence of a *ghana* (attendant spirit) of Bhairava, which, though scary, was not negative and led to intensified practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:54">[02:29:54]</a>.

## Inviting Entities
A "stupid way" to invite negative entities is by engaging in activities like using Ouija boards or other spirit-calling methods out of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. These can easily attract entities, and it may be too late to realize the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Entities can cause trouble for those closely connected to the individual, such as family or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.

## Protection and Guidance
For average individuals, the best protection is to perform *upasana* (worship) of a main deity and learn to protect oneself in case of overlap or [[interaction with spirits and entities | interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. An *exorcist* (upasaka) is formally trained and knows how to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.

*   **The Guru's Role:** A good Guru is essential for guidance, distinguishing genuine [[Higher beings and other realms | experiences]] from delusions, and navigating the complexities of spiritual [[Cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | phenomena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. The Guru's lineage (*guru parampara*) – three generations of accomplished gurus – is crucial, especially in Tantra sadhana, to ensure proper knowledge and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Hanuman Chalisa:** This hymn is considered to have anti-ghost power because Lord Hanuman is an immortal protector deity who responds quickly to pleas, especially concerning strength, power, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Reciting the Hanuman Chalisa with faith, observing celibacy, offering *bhog* (food), and meditating on Lord Rama can lead to transformative [[Cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Self-Protection:** Knowing about darkness can bring one closer to the light. Awareness of the hierarchy of negative entities is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.

## Skepticism and Reality
Skepticism, while valuable for scientific progress, has limitations in spiritual matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Arguments alone cannot convince a skeptic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. However, a negative or unusual [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | experience]] outside the normal realm of existence can dramatically change a skeptic's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. True proof comes from personal [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | experience]] rather than words in books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Influence on Human Life and Karma
There is a widely known [[Cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences | cultural phenomena of supernatural experiences]] regarding the [[Occult experiences and belief in ghosts | occult]] aspect of Tantra, particularly in politics and films, where *prayog* (application of power) is used to influence outcomes, boost careers, or remove enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. While such practices can yield results, there are always karmic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Nature's filtering mechanism ensures that those truly meant for spiritual success continue practice even without immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

## Space and the Divine
In Tantra and Hinduism, the universe ("brahmanda") is reflected within the human body ("pindanda") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. The astral domain exists throughout space, containing all thoughts, ideas, and emotions of living beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>. Beyond the astral, a silence marks the beginning of the causal realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>.

Gods exist within this space. Mahakal Shiva personifies and controls time, while Vishnu controls space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>. Advanced yogic practices like opening the Vishnu Granthi (knot of Vishnu) or Rudra Granthi (knot of Rudra) can lead to experiences of inner space, bliss, and going beyond time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This inner space is pure enough for deities to reside and offers absolute protection from even the most dangerous entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:37">[01:40:37]</a>.

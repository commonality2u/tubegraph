Vikram, a renowned actor in the Indian film industry, has a unique perspective on fame, shaped by a prolonged struggle and a life-altering accident. His journey highlights an intense dedication to his craft, profound personal growth, and a grounded approach to life despite immense public scrutiny.

## Fame as a Teacher
For Vikram, fame was a long-cherished dream, born from a deep-seated desire to reach a wider audience. He recalls being very popular in the South but unknown in Bombay (Mumbai) for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Even today, he expresses that he doesn't get tired of being mobbed, stating he "wanted this so badly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The film *Aparichit* is credited with truly putting him on the Indian map, making him the first Tamil star recognized by an entire generation of non-Tamil Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Fame, he believes, has deeply humbled him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. He admits to being "very scared" of losing himself in it and emphasizes the extreme difficulty of staying grounded amidst stardom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. This includes challenges in maintaining friendships, as people's perceptions change, making it a "very lonely space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

## [[impact_of_a_lifechanging_accident_on_vikrams_career | The Impact of a Life-Changing Accident]]
A pivotal moment in Vikram's life and career was a severe bike accident during his college years. His leg was so badly damaged that doctors at a government hospital initially suggested amputation, believing he would die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Despite the grim prognosis and being bedridden for three years with 23 surgeries, followed by a year on crutches, he remained fiercely determined to become an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

This period taught him to turn his weakness into strength. Unable to bend his knee past a certain point, he chose to excel in fight sequences in his films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. He attributes his ability to walk and run, despite doctors' warnings, to his unwavering will and positive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He even considered opting for an amputation to become a martial artist, inspired by dancer Sudha Chandran, who used a prosthetic leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.

This struggle instilled in him a deep appreciation for every character and film, considering each one a blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. His ten-year struggle in the industry, where none of his initial films were successful, further cemented his humility and understanding of the transient nature of fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

## Dedication to Craft and Character Transformation
Vikram approaches his work with 100% intensity and an almost obsessive attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He aims for distinct character transformations in every film, not just visually but also in mannerisms, speech, and movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. This drive stems from a childhood fascination with actors like Sivaji Ganesan and a school master who transformed into various characters with simple makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

His process involves deeply immersing himself in a role:
*   **Mental Formulation**: After hearing a script, he lets the character formulate in his mind for months, sometimes visualizing physical traits like a potbelly or baldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Transformation**: He is renowned for his extreme physical changes, such as gaining and losing significant weight for films like *I* (from 90 kg to 52 kg in three months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, and distorting his eyes for *Kasi*, which temporarily affected his eyesight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. For *Sethu*, he subsisted on one dry chapati, beetroot or carrot juice, and one egg white daily, walking kilometers to lose weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Psychological Immersion**: Roles that troubled him the most on a human level include:
    *   *Deiva Thirumagal* (a differentially abled character): He visited a special needs facility, picked up mannerisms, and found it difficult to detach from the role, needing to consciously remind himself he was Vikram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
    *   *Aparichit* (multiple personality disorder): Shifting between three characters was initially challenging, leading him to isolate himself on his terrace to switch off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
    *   *Thangalaan*: He described this as his most challenging film, physically and mentally fatiguing, requiring hours of makeup and acting in harsh conditions while maintaining a specific raw character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

He doesn't consciously act, rather, he immerses himself to "become that guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He believes that great acting comes from the soul, not just body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Despite the physical and mental toll, he feels the effort is always "worth it" for the impact it creates and its contribution to his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Personal Life and Relationships
[[managing_fame_and_family_reactions | Managing fame and family reactions]] is a key aspect of Vikram's personal life. He has been married for 33 years, crediting his wife, a psychologist and social worker, as his primary source of support and grounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. She initially hoped his films wouldn't succeed but now deeply supports his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. He states that love deepens with time, reaching a point where partners become indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

He maintains a clear demarcation between his public persona ("Vikram") and his private self ("Kenny") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. At home, he's just "Kenny," the normal person who walks his dog and faces family squabbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. He deliberately tried to raise his children to be normal, advising them not to reveal their father's profession at school and even using disguises in public to protect their privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. He cherishes his anonymity when with family, going to great lengths to avoid being recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>.

## Philosophical Outlook
Vikram is a deeply positive person. He doesn't hold onto sadness, believing it's always been a struggle, even today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. He embraces self-healing through Reiki, a practice he learned after his accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. He also practices meditation, seeing God as a universal energy without a specific face, finding peace in various places of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

His philosophy includes rationalizing personal failings and accepting others' negativity by understanding their motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. He believes that every artist must possess a certain "madness" or eccentricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, and that true success in acting comes from connecting to a "source," an indefinable "aura" that draws people in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

Despite the demands of his profession, Vikram cherishes every second of his career, seeing it as a blessing for pursuing his passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

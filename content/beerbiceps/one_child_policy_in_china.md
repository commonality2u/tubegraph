The "One Child Policy" was a significant demographic policy implemented in [[chinas_political_dynamics | China]] to control its population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The speaker, a Chinese entrepreneur, was born and raised in [[chinas_political_dynamics | China]] during the period of this policy and is an only child herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Implementation and Enforcement
The policy required families to have only one child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For families with Communist Party members, adherence to the policy was even more serious; they were expected to respect and follow government rules more strictly than non-communist families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Despite the strictness, some non-communist families tried to have a second or even third child by paying a penalty or attempting to hide the child when born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. These instances occurred more than 20 to 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Rationale for the Policy
The speaker defends the "One Child Policy," disagreeing with the common international perception that it was "mean" and restricted people's freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Her perspective is rooted in [[chinas_political_dynamics | China]]'s situation after World War II, where the country faced severe food shortages and immense suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

The speaker notes that many people died from lack of food, and the economy was heavily invested in weapons and heavy industry during the war, neglecting agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Her own grandmother had six [[challenges_and_pressures_faced_by_children_of_successful_parents | children]], three of whom died due to hunger, and the family struggled to care for all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Even though her grandparents were from a "quite good family" due to her grandfather being the head of a police station, they still couldn't afford to provide a good life for six [[challenges_and_pressures_faced_by_children_of_successful_parents | children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

The government introduced the policy to control births and ensure that each child born had a good life, access to good food, and quality education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This was seen as a necessary step to overcome the post-war challenges of food and resource scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

## Lifting of the Policy
The "One Child Policy" was eventually lifted by the Chinese government. The speaker states it was lifted more than 10 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, and there are now no restrictions or penalties for having a second or even third child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

India is rich in spiritual wisdom and [[role_of_spirituality_and_tradition_in_modern_life | spiritualism]], which includes an underlying occult side [00:17:49]. The podcast host notes that there is a "spiritual world" in India [00:17:53]. Many discussions around paranormal phenomena in India are rooted in [[religion_and_belief_systems_in_india_and_china | Hindu mythology]] and [[influence_of_ancient_hindu_teachings_on_modern_spirituality | ancient teachings]] [00:10:37].

## Types of Spiritual Entities and Creatures

### Chudel and Dian
Chudel (witch) and Dian are entities with a similar origin theory [00:13:10]. It is believed that if a pregnant woman or a woman dying at childbirth is not cremated properly with all rituals, her latent desires cause her to turn into a Chudel [00:00:06]. In this state, she remains on Earth unsatisfied and unable to witness the happiness of other women, acting as a vengeful entity [00:00:23].

### Yakshini
Yakshini are demigoddesses prevalent in South India [00:11:37]. They are believed to reside in Alkapuri, a realm between Earth and Heaven governed by Kubera (Ravana's brother and protector of wealth) [00:11:47]. When Yakshini meander to Earth, they are mostly in evil forms [00:12:29]. They are described as voluptuous and beautiful, but their seductive facade eventually wears off, revealing an evil form [00:12:40]. Their victims are typically men [00:00:50].

### Pishach (Ghoul)
A Pishach is a type of ghoul in [[religion_and_belief_systems_in_india_and_china | Hindu mythology]] [00:10:37]. It is believed to be created when a man dies a very violent death in a surge of anger, making it an evil and potentially lethal ghost [00:10:41].

### Betal
A Betal is a ghost that hangs from a tree, often not having a distinct form [00:18:47]. It is believed to be a man who died with unfulfilled wishes and remains attached to a permanent structure like a tree [00:19:01]. Betals are said to haunt passersby, travel with them to their homes, and create havoc in their lives [00:19:14].

### Poltergeists
Poltergeists are described as noisy, mischievous, and naughty ghosts [00:11:00]. They try to disorient people and sap their energies but rarely cause death [00:11:13].

## Nature of Ghosts and Paranormal Phenomena

The realm of ghosts is often depicted as full of suffering [00:05:35]. It is a common belief that if a person dies an unnatural death before their destined time, they spend the remainder of that time in this realm as a ghost [00:05:46].

Paranormal investigators, even those working actively in the field, often hold nuanced and differing theories about ghosts [00:06:42]. While some believe the majority of ghosts are good, evil ghosts are often those who had something left unfulfilled in their lives, or experienced an unjust or violent death [00:09:50].

The speaker notes that writing about the spirit world might make one vulnerable, as entities may become aware and decide to show themselves [00:08:08].

## Spiritual Practices and Beliefs

### Cleansing and Protection
Specific practices are used to counter dark energies or cleanse environments:
*   **Mantra Chanting:** The host recounts using a mantra learned as a child for protection during a disturbing encounter, which helped him [00:30:44].
*   **Salt Water Bath:** Salt water is commonly believed to wash off negative energy [00:33:00].
*   **Meditation:** [[importance_and_impact_of_meditation_and_spiritual_practices | Meditation]] is mentioned as a practice that can make one feel more fearless towards these entities [00:22:41].

### Spiritualism and Occult Science
*   **Vedas:** The Atharvaveda is noted for containing elements of black magic and occult sciences [00:17:25].
*   **Trees as Spirit Dwellings:** Trees, especially Banyan and Peepal trees, are believed to house spirits [00:18:14]. There is a common belief in India not to urinate on trees, as spirits dwelling there might possess you [00:18:01]. Similarly, walking under Banyan or Peepal trees at night is discouraged due to the presence of Betals [00:18:39].

### Black Magic and Healing
Mayong, a village in Assam near the Kamakhya Temple, is considered the birthplace of black magic [00:34:51]. In Mayong, black magic is believed to be practiced daily for healing purposes [00:35:07]. Tantrics and Ojas there perform mantras to spiritually cleanse people suffering from various ailments [00:35:23]. Assam is generally regarded as a place with a lot of mysticism [00:35:36]. Bengal also has a strong connection to horror literature and spiritual practices [00:35:38].

## Paranormal Investigation and Science

Paranormal investigators often seek the root cause of hauntings, which can sometimes be human mischief or an object carrying a spirit [00:20:16]. For example, a souvenir cup from a foreign country was believed to be possessed by a spirit, leading to tragic accidents [00:20:45].

While science, as conventionally understood, seeks tangible proof, the nature of ghosts as "just energy" makes them difficult to prove [00:24:09]. Paranormal investigators use tools like K2 meters to detect electromagnetic fields (EMF) [00:24:26]. An increase in EMF in places without an obvious source is inferred to be due to ghostly entities [00:24:54]. However, this is an observed proof, not direct visual evidence of a ghost [00:25:07].

Some believe that with advancements in technology, like recording dreams, a means to prove the existence of ghosts might eventually be found [00:25:47]. However, for now, [[spiritual_practices_and_growth | spiritual]] books and philosophies are often consulted for understanding these phenomena [00:05:43].

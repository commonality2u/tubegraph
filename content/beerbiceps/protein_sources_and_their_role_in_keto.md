This article outlines various protein sources and their application within a full day of eating on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]], particularly when calories are lower towards the end of the diet phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] requires careful [[importance_of_caloric_adjustment_in_keto | caloric adjustment]], with initial stages allowing for greasier foods as long as total carbs remain below 20g daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, fat intake must eventually be reduced to stay under maintenance calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Adjusting to Ketogenic Eating

People following a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] often experience a drop in appetite, making it less feasible to consume as many meals as on other diet plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The focus shifts to keeping the stomach full before workouts, rather than relying on carbohydrates for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Protein Sources in a Ketogenic Diet

### Protein Shakes
Protein shakes, mixed with water, are a common choice for breakfast on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While some dairy can be afforded, water is preferred for an ideal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Isolate Protein Supplement:** Recommended for those who want to be "super sure" about their keto diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Isolates are low in carbs and calories, and absorb faster than whey protein concentrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The main downside is their higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Whey Protein Concentrate:** Can also be consumed on keto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Post-Workout:** A protein shake with water is recommended after an intense keto-fueled workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Chicken Breast
A simple tawa fried chicken breast (100-150g) makes for a filling lunch on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It is prepared by cutting it lengthwise, marinating it in spices, and frying it on a hot cast iron skillet with a little oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Eggs
A four-egg omelette cooked with minimal oil is a suitable meal about an hour before a workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It's important not to overdo the oil, as egg yolks already contribute a significant amount of fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, which is crucial for staying within [[importance_of_caloric_adjustment_in_keto | maintenance calories]] and promoting fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Seafood
Seafood is highlighted as a crucial dinner option during [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For those on a high-protein diet, it's beneficial to continuously change protein sources, as different sources offer different benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Seafood is particularly noted for its contribution to [[importance_of_high_protein_intake_for_muscle_recovery | muscle recovery]], especially during keto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. An example given is baby palm prawns grilled Italian style with extra virgin olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Red Meat
Lamb seek kebabs are presented as an optional late-night meal for those who feel hungry before sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While ideally red meat shouldn't be consumed daily, it can be afforded on a [[basics_of_the_ketogenic_diet | ketogenic diet]] due to the allowance for extra fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Importance of Varying Protein Sources
A key principle emphasized is the importance of varying protein sources across different meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Each protein source offers unique benefits, and rotation helps ensure a broader spectrum of nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

> "Keep changing up your protein sources, different protein sources give you different benefits and seafood actually helps a lot with [[importance_of_high_protein_intake_for_muscle_recovery | Muscle Recovery]] especially during keto make sure you have some form of seafood..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

## Beyond Protein: Crucial Dietary Components

While protein is central, it's vital to complement it with other necessary components, particularly vegetables, to avoid deficiencies and constipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The 20g daily carb limit should be filled with green leafy vegetables like lettuce, cabbage, and spinach, stir-fried with garlic and curry leaves, rather than cheese or dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Carbs from even small elements like garlic pods should be counted meticulously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. For more information on [[incorporating_vegetables_for_nutrients_in_keto | incorporating vegetables]], refer to dedicated resources.

## Final Considerations

The [[ketogenic_diet_benefits_and_challenges | ketogenic diet]] requires strong psychological commitment and should be followed for a minimum of 30 days to see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with a strong affinity for carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

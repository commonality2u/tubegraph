A [[impact_of_hair_products_and_how_to_use_them | hair care routine]] is essential for men's grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond washing, conditioners play a significant role in maintaining hair health and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## What is a Conditioner?

A conditioner is an oil-based product that is a very important part of a hair care routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. While shampoos primarily focus on washing the scalp and removing excess dirt and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, conditioners contribute to the quality of your hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## How Often to Use Conditioner

The frequency of conditioner use depends on your hair type:
*   **Oily Hair/Scalp**: If you have oily genetics, like many Indians, it's advised not to overdo it with conditioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Using it more than twice a week is generally not recommended for oily hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Dry Hair/Skin**: For those with dry hair or generally dry skin, conditioner is a great option and can be used more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

It's important to figure out a system that works for your specific genetics and hair type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

## Pairing Conditioner with Shampoo

For optimal results, it is highly recommended to pair your conditioner with its "sister product" shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Same Brand/Line**: If you use a specific shampoo, choose the conditioner from the same brand and product line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. For example, if you use a "smooth intense smoothening shampoo," pair it with a "smooth intense smoothing conditioner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Products bought in pairs generally work fantastically together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

```ad-note
While conditioners are primarily about the look of your hair, making it appear thicker, glossier, and shinier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, they also offer some protection against excess humidity and dirt by forming a protective coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

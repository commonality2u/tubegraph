The journey of [[Spiritual Growth and Sadhana | spiritual growth]] is intricately linked with understanding concepts like karma, destiny, and the cyclic nature of time. This growth is not merely an internal feeling but a tangible shift in one's being that radiates outward, contributing to a global transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Understanding Karma and Destiny

Success in life is often attributed to hard work, but a deeper perspective reveals that visible effort in the current "costume" (life) is only one part of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]] carries karmas (actions) performed in previous "costumes," which influence present outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Nothing in this world is truly unfair or random; everything is a consequence of one's own past karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Destiny is not solely pre-decided by external forces but by the karmas the [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]] chooses to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. An astrological chart, for instance, serves as an "opening balance sheet" based on the karmas and sanskars (inherent personality traits) accumulated from past lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. While it's a prediction of probabilities, an individual's present actions and choices can alter their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

> "Karma and my destiny walk hand in hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

Even if past karmas bring about difficult consequences, one's approach to facing these situations can change the experience, mitigating suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. For example, by responding with calmness and acceptance instead of reaction, the same situation no longer creates suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## The Role of [[Spirituality and Meditation | Meditation]] in [[Spiritual Growth and Sadhana | Spiritual Growth]]

[[Spirituality and meditation | Meditation]] is a key practice for [[personal_development_through_spiritual_discipline_and_selfcare | personal development through spiritual discipline and selfcare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. Its effects extend beyond the meditation session, creating a shift in one's overall personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This shift is evident in daily interactions, where one can respond to life's challenges with greater calmness and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Through [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]], the mind is cleansed of "clutter" and lower vibrational energies such as stress, anger, and judgmental thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This purification leads to a reduction in emotional fatigue and improves the quality of rest and mental clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Spiritual progress is measured not just by the depth of meditation experiences but by the transformation of one's feelings and actions in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The goal is to become a "Karam Yogi," meaning one operates in a meditative state even while performing daily actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This builds "spiritual stamina," enabling one to respond calmly rather than react, even when faced with difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## The Concept of Sanskar

Sanskar refers to emotional patterns or inherent nature that come with a [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]] from past karmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. These can include tendencies like criticism, appreciation, doubt, or trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. They are part of the [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]]'s makeup, not solely the body's gender or social conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

Meditation helps to "melt" or transform negative sanskars, leading to positive changes in one's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. By working on these inner patterns, individuals can consciously shift their destiny and influence the outcomes of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

## Cycles of Time: From Iron Age to Golden Age

The world operates in grand cycles of time, similar to the daily cycle of morning, afternoon, evening, and night, or the seasonal cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These cycles include the Golden Age (Satyug), Silver Age (Treta Yug), Copper Age (Dwapar Yug), and Iron Age (Kaliyug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Humanity is currently in the "peak of Iron Age" (Ghor Kalyug), which signifies a decline in [[understanding_spiritual_traditions_and_their_impact_on_life | spiritual traditions and their impact on life]] and an increase in vices like ego, lust, greed, jealousy, and mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

This period is a time of "paradigm shift" and "transition," where the "night is coming to an end and the morning is beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While some remain in spiritual "sleep," others are beginning their "awakening" by raising their vibrations through practices like [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

A "tipping point" of individuals raising their vibrations can collectively shift the planet's energy, overpowering lower vibrational influences and leading to a global transformation into the Golden Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This shift will involve significant upheaval, but it also marks the construction of a new world, with individuals contributing to this creation through their internal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

## The Purpose of Existence and Divine Connection

The increasing population of the Earth suggests that [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | souls]] are continually returning from a "soul world" or "home" that lies beyond the physical universe known to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This is the collective "home" that many spiritual traditions refer to, and the [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]] carries a faint memory of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

The ultimate purpose is to remember one's true identity as a [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]], reconnect with the Divine Parent (God), and realize one's inherent spiritual potential and powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. This [[the_significance_of_higher_and_lower_beings_in_spirituality | divine connection]] is what raises one's frequency and empowers the [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Ancient religious figures and prophets, such as Jesus Christ, Buddha, and Guru Nanak Dev, did not come to divide humanity or establish rigid religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. They came to teach "religion" (dham), which refers to the fundamental duties and qualities of the [[insights_on_life_death_and_rebirth_in_spiritual_philosophy | soul]]: purity, peace, love, power, wisdom, and bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Their teachings used different metaphors and stories but shared a common core message about humanity's divine potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

## [[Spirituality and Personal Wellbeing | Spirituality]] in Daily Life

[[Spirituality and personal wellbeing | Spirituality]] is not a separate life to embark upon; it is the way to live one's existing life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. It means performing one's roles and responsibilities—whether in [[relationships_and_personal_growth | relationships]], work, or hobbies—with a different, elevated frame of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This shift in internal vibration transforms the quality of one's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.

Instead of seeking happiness or appreciation from external achievements, one practices radiating happiness while doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This perspective shifts individuals from being "suckers from the world" to "givers to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

All close [[relationships_and_personal_growth | relationships]] are built on past karmic accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. When difficulties arise in [[relationships_and_personal_growth | relationships]], [[spirituality_and_meditation | meditation]] helps individuals put aside ego and initiate positive karma to heal the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This active effort, even when the other party does not reciprocate immediately, builds spiritual stamina and settles past karmic accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

Ultimately, [[spirituality_and_personal_wellbeing | spirituality]] teaches that the human experience is like clay, which can be molded into whatever one desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>. The highest use of this "clay" is to foster [[spiritual_growth_and_sadhana | spiritual growth]] and align oneself with a higher purpose, contributing to the awakening of the entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

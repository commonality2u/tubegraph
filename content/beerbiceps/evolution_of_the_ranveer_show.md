The Ranveer Show (TRS) has undergone significant evolution, growing to become "India's most curious podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This journey is marked by a vast output of content and a unique approach to its development.

## Early Growth and Philosophy

The show's expansion stems from "more than 3,000 videos, 450 podcasts, and 8 years of [[impact_of_the_podcast_on_indian_content_creation | content creation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its growth is attributed to the enjoyment of the process and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The creators find "so much to learn in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> with every episode, and their primary satisfaction comes from sharing this knowledge with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Milestones and New Identity

A significant milestone for The Ranveer Show was securing "the first ever brand partnership for a self-produced Indian podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. As a result, "TRS is now AIO presents TRS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Style and Content Transformation

While maintaining its core essence—"same curiosity, same magnanimous guest, same free flowing conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>—the show has adopted a "different one size style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, becoming "more fashionable than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The show is set to host "16 of the most successful Minds who've all achieved it in style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, releasing "16 epic new episodes over the next few weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This new phase is branded as "AIO presents the show where we collectively learned to achieve it in style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Films and media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions and beliefs regarding the [[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | paranormal]]. Often, the portrayals in entertainment can lead to misconceptions and influence how individuals interpret their own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>.

## Misconceptions from Media Portrayals
According to [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal investigator]] Sarabjit Mohanti, many people contact investigators reporting experiences that are not truly paranormal but are influenced by horror movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. A common misconception in India, for example, is the image of a ghost wearing a white sari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>. This trope was popularized by Indian horror films, particularly after the Ram Brothers' generation, which focused more on monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The idea that a female is always the main ghost or demon also stems from this media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

The "white sari" concept itself originated thousands of years ago from the belief that a pure soul is white, and therefore, a soul leaving the body after death must also be white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Exaggeration Versus Reality
Horror movies often get things wrong by excessively depicting the damage entities can inflict on bodies or environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. While films like *The Conjuring* are considered among the closest to realistic [[paranormal_activities and supernatural entities | paranormal]] movies in terms of portraying investigators and storylines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, even they incorporate "creative liberty" to generate fear and attract viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. If there's no fear, people won't watch a horror movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Serial Killers and Demonology
The podcast discusses the [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | link between serial killers and demonology]], a topic explored in media. Individuals like Jeffrey Dahmer and Son of Sam have been linked to demonology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Son of Sam, for instance, claimed he was commanded to kill by his neighbor's pet dog, which he believed to be Lucifer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The belief is that these individuals lose their humanity and are either possessed by or become demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Challenges to Scientific Acknowledgment
The scientific community often does not discuss or acknowledge these topics due to past instances where individuals have disrespected the [[paranormal_investigations_and_beliefs | paranormal field]], turning it into a "work of a fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. There are more fake individuals in this field globally than genuine ones, leading to a common misconception that [[skepticism_and_belief_in_the_supernatural | paranormal phenomena]] are fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

Despite this, some physicists in the UK are staunch believers in the paranormal and conduct mind-blowing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. However, science primarily focuses on fields with direct human application and problems to solve, which the paranormal is not considered to be by the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

The definition of "paranormal" itself, set by some scientists, states it's "something that cannot be replicated in a scientific lab," making it impossible to study within laboratory settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Media's Role in Awareness
Podcasts like Joe Rogan's in the USA have been culturally significant for bringing topics the scientific community might not acknowledge to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Similarly, podcasts like TRS (The Ranveer Show) aim to do the same for other departments, encouraging wider discussion on [[cultural_phenomena_of_supernatural_experiences | supernatural experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Such platforms can help people understand different angles and explore topics like the [[occult_experiences_and_belief_in_ghosts | occult]] and [[paranormal_activities and supernatural entities | demonology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Authenticity vs. Exploitation in Filmmaking
Some horror films, like *Hereditary*, have been noted to contain actual satanic mantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. While directors and producers might do this for authenticity, it raises questions about precautions taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. In India, some producers consult with paranormal experts to ensure sets are shielded and protected when using real symbols or depicting paranormal elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This highlights the need to understand the potential impact of depicting such elements authentically.

## The "Mata Aana" Phenomenon
The "Mata Aana" phenomenon refers to a positive deity possessing someone who is open to the possession, allowing them to answer questions for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This can be seen as a divine power giving out messages or doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

However, just like other [[paranormal_activities and supernatural entities | paranormal phenomena]], the "Mata Aana" phenomenon can also be faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. In rural areas, some women might engage in this to gain attention and receive offerings they wouldn't otherwise get in male-dominated societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This dual nature of authenticity and fabrication contributes to the negative perception and [[skepticism_and_belief_in_the_supernatural | skepticism]] surrounding the [[role_of_science_and_technology_in_paranormal_studies | paranormal]] in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

Ultimately, to truly understand the [[cultural_perceptions_of_hauntings_and_spirits | paranormal]], one must be open to both its light and dark aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

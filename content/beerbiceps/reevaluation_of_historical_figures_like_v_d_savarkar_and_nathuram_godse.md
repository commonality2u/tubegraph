From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The discussion surrounding Indian history, particularly the struggle for independence, has seen renewed interest, especially among younger generations who question the "linear" and "monochromatic" narratives presented in traditional textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Many feel that large parts of India's history, including stories of valor and courage, have been deliberately hidden or misrepresented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This has led to a reevaluation of figures like V.D. Savarkar and Nathuram Godse, whose roles and motivations are often debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Unveiling Hidden History

The traditional account of the Indian Freedom Movement, heavily influenced by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress, emphasizes a non-violent mass movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. However, there was also an "unending chain" of armed resistance from 1857 until the 1946 Naval Mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### The 1946 Naval Mutiny

The Naval Mutiny, which started in Bombay (now Mumbai), is often overlooked in history textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This uprising, fueled by dissatisfaction with ratings and inspired by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA), spread across different parts of India, including South India, Karachi, and Jabalpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

Former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who oversaw India's independence, reportedly stated in the early 1950s that the heroics of the INA and the subsequent naval mutinies were the primary reasons for Britain's hasty departure, not the non-violent Quit India Movement, whose impact he described as "minimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. The British were "petrified" of a repeat of the 1857 uprising within the British Indian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

### Labeling Revolutionaries as "Terrorists"

A significant point of contention is the use of the term "revolutionary terrorists" for figures like Bhagat Singh, Bagha Jatin, and Chandrashekhar Azad in Delhi University and UPSC textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Descendants of Bhagat Singh have protested this, arguing it was a term coined by colonial masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. This labeling creates a false equivalence with modern terrorism, potentially misleading young students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

### The Role of Post-Independence Governments in Shaping Narratives

After independence, the ruling establishment is perceived to have strategically controlled the historical narrative to highlight a specific viewpoint about the freedom struggle, often marginalizing those who were not part of the non-violent mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

For instance, celebrated historian R.C. Majumdar was initially commissioned to write a history of the freedom struggle but was removed when he insisted on being critical of Mahatma Gandhi's "flip-flop policies" and potential failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. A bureaucrat with no background in modern Indian history was then put in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. This sent a clear message to other historians that towing the official line was necessary to maintain patronage and careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.

Another example is Yashpal, who was reportedly a British informer and responsible for leaking information that led to Chandrashekhar Azad's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. Despite this, after independence, Yashpal became a "most loved intellectual," winning awards and writing books that exaggerated his own revolutionary role, often disparaging other freedom fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

This narrative control aimed to portray the British peacefully handing over power, as seen in films like Richard Attenborough's "Gandhi," which received global acclaim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. Such portrayals, while globally appealing, often overshadowed the sacrifices of those involved in the armed struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

### [[controversial_perspectives_on_indian_history | Delhi-Centric History]]

Indian history textbooks are often criticized for being "Delhi-centric," disproportionately focusing on dynasties and events tied to Delhi, while neglecting significant empires and regions like the Cholas, Vijayanagara, Rashtrakutas, and the entire Northeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. For example, the Ahom rulers, who ruled for 600 years in the Northeast, are barely mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## V.D. Savarkar: A Deeper Look

[[vikram_sampaths_view_on_the_indian_freedom_movement | Vikram Sampath]] is known for his work on the [[role_of_alternate_narratives_in_the_indian_freedom_struggle | Indian Freedom Movement]], including extensive research on V.D. Savarkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Revolutionary Contributions

Savarkar is recognized for founding India's first organized secret society, Abhinav Bharat (initially Mitra Mela) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. He initiated the first student bonfire of foreign clothes in 1905, years before Gandhi, for which he was rusticated from college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. While studying law in London, he actively led the revolutionary movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.

His seminal work, "The Indian War of Independence of 1857," based on British documents, re-categorized the 1857 uprising from a "sepoy mutiny" to the "first war of Indian independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>. This book became a "Bhagat Gita" for future revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Rash Behari Bose, and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>.

Savarkar endured 14 years of imprisonment (12 in Kalapani, 2 in Indian mainland jails) and 13 years under house arrest in Ratnagiri, unable to leave the district <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>. His degrees were stripped, and his family's property was confiscated, forcing them to beg for a livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>.

### The Kalapani Experience

The Cellular Jail in Port Blair, known as Kalapani, was a "horrific" Indian "Bastille" where largely revolutionaries, not Congress members, were housed alongside hardened criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a>. Prisoners faced inhumane conditions:
*   Lack of basic human rights, including good food, drinking water, and toilet facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:46:00">[44:46:00]</a>.
*   Punishments like standing handcuffed for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.
*   Contaminated food, leading to illness, with fixed toilet timings resulting in defecation in cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:58:00">[44:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:00">[45:45:07]</a>.
*   The "Kuka Bell" punishment, where prisoners were forced to extract oil from seeds by turning a mill like a bullock, often resulting in whiplashing and denial of food if targets were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>.
*   No medical treatment for rashes or leech bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:00]</a>.
*   Many young prisoners, often in their teens or early twenties, committed suicide or went mad due to the tortures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>.
*   Savarkar, a prolific poet, would write on cell walls with charcoal, only for the jailers to whitewash it; he memorized over 4,000 lines of his poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:00">[46:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>.

Historians encourage visiting Kalapani as a "place of pilgrimage" for Indian students to understand the sacrifices made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>.

### The "Mercy Petitions" Controversy

Critics often point to Savarkar's "mercy petitions" as evidence of being a "traitor" or a "British stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. However, it is argued that such petitions were common practice for political prisoners at the time, akin to modern bail applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. Savarkar's petitions, fully detailed in his biographies, contained "nowhere an apology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. British records themselves noted his lack of "regret or repentance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. Many petitions were filed on behalf of younger, less educated revolutionaries, demonstrating his role as their spokesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.

### The Concept of [[hindutva | Hindutva]]

Savarkar's concept of [[hindutva | Hindutva]], as outlined in his book "Essentials of Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?", is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. He explicitly stated it had "nothing to do with the theological aspects of Hinduism as a religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>. Instead, it was conceived as a "cultural and national identity marker," defining those who consider India (Hindustan/Al-Hind) as their *punyabhumi* (holy land) and *pitrubhumi* (ancestral land), regardless of their specific religion (Jain, Muslim, Parsi, Sikh, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. This idea emerged during the Khilafat Movement, which Savarkar saw as a dangerous communal movement that could lead to partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>.

Savarkar was a strong advocate for "cast eradication" and unification of Hindu society, which contradicts modern misinterpretations of [[hindutva | Hindutva]] being equated with caste hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[42:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12:00">[43:12:00]</a>.

## Nathuram Godse and the Gandhi Assassination

Nathuram Godse, who had served as Savarkar's secretary and confidant in the Hindu Mahasabha youth wing, was one of the individuals executed for Mahatma Gandhi's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. Godse's motivation for assassinating Gandhi was primarily his belief that Gandhi had become a "national security threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.

This conviction solidified when Gandhi announced a fast unto death around January 12, 1948, demanding that the Indian government pay 50 crores (approx. 500 million rupees) to Pakistan as promised, even as Pakistani forces were making incursions into Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:57:00">[54:57:00]</a>. Godse and his associates believed this money would be used to arm Pakistan against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:00">[55:29:00]</a>.

The atmosphere in Delhi at the time was highly charged, with refugees from Pakistan protesting Gandhi's stance and wishing for his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>. There was an aborted assassination attempt on January 20, 1948, and despite police knowledge of threats to Gandhi's life, he was not given adequate security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>.

### Savarkar's Exoneration

Due to his past affiliation with Godse, Savarkar was implicated in the Gandhi murder case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a>. However, based on court documents, there was no corroborating evidence to link Savarkar to the conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:41:00">[57:41:00]</a>. By this time, Savarkar had suffered two heart attacks and was described as almost a pacifist, wanting to cooperate with the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>. After a year-long trial at the Red Fort, the judge honorably exonerated Savarkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>. This exoneration was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, which ruled that insinuations against Savarkar's involvement were "null and void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:56:00">[58:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>.

### The 1948 Anti-Maharashtrian Brahmin Carnage

Following Gandhi's assassination, an "anti-Maharashtrian Brahman Carnage" swept across Maharashtra, spearheaded by Congress "goons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. This retaliation targeted members of the community to which Godse belonged. Many Maharashtrian Brahmins were killed, lost property, and faced ethnic cleansing, with no cases filed and no justice served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Many victims remain anonymous due to fears of retribution from perpetrators' politically powerful descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## The Need for Truth and Reconciliation in History

The suppression of historical facts and the whitewashing of crimes, particularly genocides and murders, lead to "unhealed energy" that affects future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. An honest assessment of the past and making peace with it is crucial for a nation to move forward with confidence and closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. History should not be used as a tool for contemporary political correctness, nor should national unity be built on "faulty foundations of fabricated history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

It is important to read diverse perspectives on history, from all ideological viewpoints, to form an informed opinion rather than relying on rhetoric, assumptions, or political propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

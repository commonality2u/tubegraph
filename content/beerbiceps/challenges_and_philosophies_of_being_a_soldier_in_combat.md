This article explores the profound [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | challenges and experiences of military operations]] faced by soldiers, particularly within Special Forces, and how these experiences shape their [[the_spiritual_and_psychological_aspects_of_military_life | spiritual and psychological aspects of military life]]. Major Vivek Jacob, a highly respected Special Forces veteran, shares his unique [[perspectives_on_war_and_peace | perspectives on war and peace]], the nature of battle, and insights into consciousness, intuition, and the fabric of reality, informed by a career of intense [[combat_experiences_and_survival_strategies | combat experiences and survival strategies]].

## The Nature of Special Forces

Special Forces (SF) in India, including the Commandos or Para SF, represent the highest efficiency part of the Indian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. These soldiers are described as psychologically and physically "a cut above the rest" due to their supplemental [[psychological_and_mental_training_in_the_armed_forces | psychological and mental training]] and the nature of their missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Major Jacob defines Special Forces not merely as a unit but as a [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | mindset and mentality]] that develops over time through various emotional, psychological, and physical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

The core idea is that every human being is uniquely special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The Special Forces [[special_forces_mindset_and_mentality | mindset]] is a realization of this inherent uniqueness, leading to a focused energy directed towards national security and protecting the freedom of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. SF units are tasked with "creative destruction," meaning they can be deployed "anything anywhere anytime" to remove elements that don't fit the long-term vision of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Every operation is considered a "masterpiece" requiring the soldier to be fully present ("in the now") and adaptable, combining training, equipment, and experience to achieve the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Challenges in Combat

### Physical and Psychological Extremes

Soldiers face extreme physical and [[psychological_and_ethical_aspects_of_military_life | Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Military Life]] in combat. Major Jacob recounts an incident where a young soldier, despite having his eye pop out due to a bullet's impact on his bulletproof vest, still managed to kill his assailant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This soldier later lost his memory for months and his face was disfigured, highlighting the severe [[challenges_and_experiences_of_military_operations | prices one pays]] in service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.

Major Jacob shares his own most challenging experience, where, after over a decade of service, he felt an unprecedented, growing discomfort and anxiety during an operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. This feeling, which he initially rationalized as laziness or a desire for comfort, intensified into extreme anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:20]</a>. Shortly after, his teammate stepped on a mine and lost a leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. This chaotic situation, far from base, with a severely injured comrade and the threat of more mines, presented the ultimate test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. The difference between life and death in such a scenario depends on immediate action and mental fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>.

In the SF, a "f-up" is defined as a teammate getting shot, maimed, or dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. Unlike civilian professions where mistakes might lead to financial loss or judgment, in the SF, "you make a mistake, somebody's going to die," or be permanently injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

### The Siachen Glacier Experience

Major Jacob describes Siachen Glacier as an "extremely difficult place to survive and work in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>. The cold is so intense that water thrown in the air freezes instantly, and vegetables become rock solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>. Exposed skin burns and then becomes numb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.

Beyond the extreme cold, the environment is fraught with danger from enemy action, including artillery shelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. The sound of an incoming artillery shell, described as a "whistle," and its subsequent explosion, is "terror in supreme form," an "indescribable terror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Close calls with shrapnel, which flies like "razor blades" due to molten metal from explosions, are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>.

### Near-Death Experience and Survival

Major Jacob recounts a moment of intense fear when he was caught in an impossible situation, stuck on a cliff face with a deep drop below, holding onto grass, while being observed by an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>. In this moment, he experienced a "near-death experience" or "life flash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>. He saw his entire life flash before his eyes like a photo album with videos, but with no emotion, judgment, regret, or guilt â€“ a detached observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

Despite the 0% chance of survival in such a scenario, he survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>. He attributes this to an "alternative form of reality" and the exact opposite of what should have happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>. The opponent "just chose not to shoot" for unknown reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

## Spiritual and Philosophical Aspects of Soldiering

### The Monk-Soldier Connection

Major Jacob observes that only two groups of people discuss life with such profound frequency: monks and Special Forces veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. He describes his own evolution as letting go of "concepts" and "perceptions about what reality is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This journey moves from understanding to "realization of what is," allowing one to "live life in a blissful Heavenly manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. His experiences in the SF and on the battlefield have educated his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

### Flow State and Intuition

In combat, a "flow state" is essential for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This involves surrendering to the situation, which leads to acceptance, then awareness, and finally the ability to make the crucial choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This is the essence of [[understanding_consciousness_and_intuition_in_military_scenarios | understanding consciousness and intuition]] in military scenarios.

Major Jacob explicitly states that he developed a "sixth sense" or intuition over time, allowing him to "know that something is going to happen" before a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. This isn't about predicting enemy moves, but a deep sense that an event will occur, sometimes "5-6 hours before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. This capability arises from letting go of duality (life/death, past/future) and becoming completely focused "in the now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. When one crosses this mental barrier, the "spiritual aspect of your existence opens up," allowing information to "pour into your Consciousness" from a higher place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This expansion of awareness, beyond the five senses, allows one to "download information from a higher place" and perceive possibilities that haven't physically manifested yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Karma, Reality, and the Cosmic Dream

Major Jacob's view on karma is nuanced: "yes and no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. He believes karma exists for those whose "neural network is formed like that," for whom cause and effect are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>. However, for "consciousnesses which have zoomed out" of that limited perception, karma is an "illusion like everything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>. He emphasizes that reality is subjective, a "perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

His ultimate understanding is that all of reality is an "illusion" or a "dream," akin to the ancient wisdom of Vishnu dreaming the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>. Just as characters and emotions in a dream feel real until one wakes up, life's experiences are intensely real within this "cosmic mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>. The goal is to "wake up" and realize it's a dream, then gain the ability to "dream the dream you wish to dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.

## Unique Relationship with Nature and Animals

Being constantly immersed in "raw nature" in combat zones fosters a unique connection between soldiers and wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>. Soldiers "merge with nature" not just physically, but at a "deeper Consciousness level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>.

### Leopard Encounter

Major Jacob recounts sitting on a mountain at night, staring into the darkness, when he heard a noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Switching on his night vision goggles, he saw a leopard sitting less than a meter away, staring at the same spot he was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. He aimed his weapon, ready to kill if attacked, but after four or five minutes, the leopard simply walked off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

He explains this non-conflict by suggesting that both he and the leopard were "peaceful," in alignment, and immersed "in the now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. Animals operate on instinct, "beyond judgment," and therefore embody a "more relaxed and more higher Consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. Soldiers in combat, especially the most experienced, also operate "in the moment," without thinking, as thinking creates "tensions" and "limitations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. Furthermore, soldiers often go weeks without bathing, aligning their scent with the forest, making them a familiar presence to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

### Bear Encounters

Indian bears, while appearing cute, are incredibly powerful and dangerous, capable of tearing a person apart with their claws and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. The most dangerous is a mother bear with cubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. Major Jacob recounts an instance where a mother bear with two cubs, despite the potential threat, "coolly walked off" without attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. This is attributed to the soldiers' lack of fear, which animals can sense through their olfactory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

He also describes a terrifying encounter where he and his team were observing an area from a cliff, unknowingly on the path of two bears who lived in a nearby cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. After repeated attempts to climb past them, one bear charged, stopping within two meters, roaring into Major Jacob's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. In a moment of absolute "Flow State," Major Jacob prepared to shoot, knowing a small-caliber bullet might not be enough and a shot would compromise their mission by revealing their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. His comrade, a local SF soldier, flashed a red laser light into the bear's eyes, causing it to stumble back and retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. In those few seconds, there was "no fear, no emotions, nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

## Conclusion: Purpose and Evolution

Major Jacob believes that the [[combat_experiences and survival strategies | experiences]] of soldiers in extreme life-or-death situations offer valuable lessons for civilians facing their own "ups and downs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He emphasizes that every human being is ultimately the same, "Consciousness expressing itself in infinite number of forms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.

His post-military initiative, "Soul of Steel," aims to create "human ability biomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. This program combines military and mountaineering skills like unarmed combat, emergency medical response, and survival training to put participants in challenging situations that "Unleash Your realization of your own self" and make them "better human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>. The core belief is that everyone has "a god inside them," a "supreme Consciousness with Supreme ability," and the journey of life is to realize that godliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>. By creating the right circumstances, this potential can be realized, leading to "more open human beings" who "spread love joy and peace and capability in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas is described as one of the most productive individuals known to mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. Her appearances on "TRS" have been significant, with her first episode being the 13th ever, which the host considers a "lucky charm" that changed the podcast's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. She provided a quiet, calming, and professional energy, offering content that worked for the show and helping the host, which served as a reference point for media professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:04">[03:37:04]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Philosophy

Priyanka Chopra Jonas is currently happier than she has been in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This stems from a place of not struggling with issues that affected her when she was younger, which she attributes to maturity and being over 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. She is no longer running as fast, is more thoughtful about her steps, and finds contentment in her life choices, which are now her own and not defined by external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance

In her younger years, the idea of relentless work (24 hours, multiple movies, no sleep or food) was romanticized as the path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, through life experience, she realized the critical importance of [[balancing_family_responsibilities_and_career | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. A recent trip to Turks and Caicos, where her phones were off, allowed her to feel rejuvenated, excited, and motivated for her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. She believes work should be a companion and a source of joy, not solely tough and rough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Achieving this balance allows her to focus more intently when she returns to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### Redefining Success and Purpose

While some might suggest she's achieved enough success to retire, Priyanka Chopra Jonas expresses a deep love for her job and the ability to create in diverse ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. She views her career as a legacy for her children and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. She believes the meaning of life is having purpose, and what one does between birth and death constitutes their legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>. Success is subjective, and she emphasizes that one should pursue what makes them feel peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>.

## International Career Trajectory

Her career in the US began in 2010 with music, before she pivoted to acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>.
She described it as starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Humility

Moving to a new country like America and starting a career from scratch required immense humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>. Despite her incredible career and credibility in India, she had to introduce herself, present her showreel, and express her desire to work with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. She accepted numerous small roles in Hollywood movies, understanding that every new actor begins there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. She believes it's unrealistic to expect the same treatment and remuneration in a new country just because one is a big star elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>. This required pounding the pavement, facing rejection, auditioning, and adapting to a new country's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. She had to "swallow the humility pill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

> "I had to swallow the humility pill and I was willing to do that hard work and then 10 years later I finally got my leading role in a movie I finally got the same renumeration as a man which I never did in Bollywood I have never got the same check as my male co-actor even if my part is the same even if I've held the movie as much as I can finally I got it in 2020 one after 21 years of working." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>

The [[challenges_and_struggles_in_the_entertainment_industry | tears it took]] to move to a new country with no friends or family, working with people who didn't know her capabilities, were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. Her co-actors on *Quantico* initially didn't understand the "hoopla" around her as the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>. She emphasized that one must learn to adapt to their environment, comparing it to deep-sea diving after fishing from a boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.

She acknowledges that people, particularly in India, sometimes try to jeopardize careers out of jealousy, a mindset she attributes to a colonial past of "divide and rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>. She encourages focusing on the people who believe in you and the "sliver of light," rather than the negativity, to avoid becoming "dark and negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

### Achieving Success and Agency

After 10 years of consistent effort, she secured her first leading role in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. Crucially, in 2020, after 21 years in the industry, she finally received the same remuneration as her male co-actors, something she had never achieved in Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.

Her career milestones also include:
*   Winning Miss India and then Miss World at 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   Her parents, both successful doctors, gave up their practice to support her 19-year-old dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. She considers being born to parents who encouraged her to have an opinion a significant privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   Her generation of women actors fought for agency and lead roles, opening doors for the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. She cites *Mary Kom* as an early example of a commercially successful female-led film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. She challenges the continued use of terms like "female-led films" when "male-led films" isn't a common descriptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Journey

Her venture into entrepreneurship began with her mother's foresight. At 30, her mother advised her to consider alternative careers, as Bollywood often had a limited shelf life for actresses over 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. This prompted her interest in production, learning about the business of entertainment, cost recovery, and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.

Later, while working in America, she developed an interest in investments through her manager, a venture capitalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. Her small investments, like in Bumble, grew significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>. Bringing Bumble to India, where it revolutionized the dating scene for women by offering a safe space where women make the first move, demonstrated the power of a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Her first self-founded brand is Anomaly, a hair care line created with market leaders Mesa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. Anomaly aims to be clean, affordable, and sustainable, using 100% recycled trash for packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:13:00">[45:13:00]</a>. This focus on sustainable packaging allowed a larger budget for excellent formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:00">[45:29:00]</a>. She debunks the marketing myth that men's and women's hair care needs are different, stating hair is made of the same material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>. Anomaly's success, selling a product every 7 seconds on Nykaa on its launch day and becoming a top 10 hair care brand in 3 months, fills her with pride akin to making a good movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>.

She emphasizes that success, like turning something to "gold," comes from hard work and meticulous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:33:00">[47:33:00]</a>, citing the year and a half of research and refinement that went into Anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>.

## Wisdom and Advice

Priyanka Chopra Jonas gives messages of empowerment and self-reliance.

### Message for Young Ambitious Women

She admires the current generation of fearless girls who take charge of their lives and refuse to fit into traditional "cookie-cutter molds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Many young women are changing their families' trajectories through their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

Her key message is to ignore the "noise" and narratives that dictate how women should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. She recalls being taught in school that women should be "seen not heard" and prescribed behaviors about appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. She champions the idea that "Bold Girls Make History" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. To be the lead actor of your own life, you must make choices that might contradict what you've been told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. This empowerment must come from within if not from external sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. She advises finding inspiration from others but actively thinking about what you can do to achieve that feeling for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

### Tackling [[personal_challenges_and_mental_health | Personal Challenges]]

She would advise her younger self not to stress so much, as she experienced anxiety around losing her job or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. She emphasizes that aging is an inevitable fact of life, and society puts too much "equity on age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. The focus should be on who you want to be at any given age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. She advises people to remove "poisonous" or "toxic" individuals from their lives and surround themselves only with those who are genuinely happy for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a>.

Being a public figure is difficult; celebrities are constantly under scrutiny and public consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. She notes that opinions about her are beyond her control, and dwelling on negativity would prevent her from achieving anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>. Despite fame, she remains grounded, emphasizing that fame is a byproduct, not her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.

She believes in destiny and has a lot of faith, practicing daily Puja and expressing gratitude for her health, life, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>. She also questions why she is lucky enough to have her life while others with similar ambitions do not, leading to a daily sense of gratitude and a desire to give back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. She believes in setting achievable small next dreams rather than waiting for miracles, as one must "create it for yourself" by taking step-by-step actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.

[[Tantric practices and mantras | Tantric practices]] and devotion are central to protecting oneself from negative entities and influences. These practices help individuals build spiritual strength and discernment, which are crucial when interacting with subtle realms.

## Understanding Negative Entities

Various types of negative entities are described, each with distinct characteristics and methods of influence:

*   **Bhoots (Discarnate Entities)**
    These are human-like entities without physical bodies. They may be trapped on the astral plane due to unfulfilled desires like hunger, anger, or lust, and are unable to progress further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. If agitated, they can cause trouble to those in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Their knowledge is often limited, similar to human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. Sometimes, these are *pitrus* or ancestors who are dead but stuck in the Pitru Loka, a part of the astral plane, and may project their problems onto living descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>.

*   **Pras (Angry Spirits)**
    Pras are very angry spirits, often former human beings in a highly negative state due to twisted karmas, or those who indulged in negative practices or experienced violent deaths (e.g., accidental death at a young age, suicide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:05">[04:50:05]</a>. They can cause diseases, obstructions, accidents, and turn efforts negative, leading to strange negative occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

*   **Pishachas (Dangerous Entities)**
    These are generally more dangerous than Pras, and many were never human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Some are "Brahma Pishachas," highly knowledgeable spiritual practitioners who misused or hoarded their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Pishachas are likened to "mad bulls" due to their aggressive and irrational nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. They are often confined to specific areas with extreme negative energy, dark, or filthy settings, sometimes associated with recurring foul odors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. They can influence human beings, spreading their power or seeking attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

*   **Asuras (Highest Negative Entities)**
    Asuras are the highest negative entities in Dharma, possessing immense raw power, exceptional intelligence, and mastery of intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. They are not atheists; they fully acknowledge the existence of Gods but choose to misuse their powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. In the current age (Kaliyuga), Asuras are unlikely to incarnate physically due to their overwhelming power for human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. However, they can influence people's minds from their own planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. It is believed that Lord Krishna and Arjuna ensured Asuras do not get physically born in Kaliyuga, though their influence cannot be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Influence and Risk

*   **General Interference:** Negative entities, particularly Bhoots, can cause trouble if agitated, especially to those in the same physical and astral space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Practitioners:** Specific entities interfere with those engaged in [[spiritual_beliefs_and_practices_in_india | spiritual practices]] to disrupt their rhythm and cause their energy to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Historical texts like the Ramayana describe Asuras destroying Yagnas (fire rituals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Large-Scale Destruction:** Asuras influence people who can cause significant destruction (e.g., Hitler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Harm:** Pras can cause diseases, obstructions, accidents, and even physical scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Entities can enter dreams to cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Sticking to Individuals:** Passing through a haunted place can cause entities to stick to someone if there's a karmic link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Posing as Deities:** Demonic entities can pose as positive deities, appearing with effulgence and power, especially if the worshipper has secret desires like greed or wanting quick success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Such possession requires an "affirmation from within," which isn't verbal but a secret motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Stupid Ways to Invite Entities

Engaging in activities like using Ouija boards or other spirit-calling methods out of curiosity is considered a "stupid way" to invite negative entities, as one does not know what they are calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. It's not difficult for them to manifest once invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Protection Methods

[[The role of meditation and spirituality in protection | Meditation and spirituality]] offer significant protection against darker energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

*   **Upasana (Worship of a Deity)**
    The most crucial method of protection is to perform upasana (devotional practice or worship) of a main deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This means performing sadhana (spiritual practice) dedicated to a chosen deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This is considered the best an average human can do to protect themselves in case of overlap or interaction with entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The entire process of upasana is to build the spiritual fitness of the mind and body to be able to take the energy of interaction with a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

*   **Hanuman Chalisa**
    The Hanuman Chalisa is highly effective for protection. Lord Hanuman is considered a protective deity who responds quickly because he chose to remain in the physical plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Reciting the Hanuman Chalisa with faith can protect against various negative entities, diseases, and spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. A specific sadhana involves daily recitation (54 or 108 times) for 40 days, maintaining celibacy, offering Prasad, and meditating on Lord Rama's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

*   **Specific Deities:**
    *   **Lord Hanuman:** Excellent as a protective deity and responds faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. His domain includes strength, power, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Bhairava:** Also protects very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Matara:** The speaker used Matara mantra sadhana and a fire ritual to successfully ward off negative entities causing extreme negative thoughts and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

*   **Importance of a Guru:**
    A [[role_and_practice_of_Tantra_and_Sadhana | good Guru]] is essential for guidance, especially when navigating complex spiritual experiences that cannot be verbally explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. A Guru helps discern what to take seriously and what not to get attached to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. In [[origins_and_development_of_Tantra | Tantra]], it's crucial that the Guru belongs to a recognized Guru *parampara* (lineage) with at least three generations of accomplished gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Worship and *Tarpanam* (a ritual offering for satisfaction) to the Guru lineage are vital for protection and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

*   **Rituals for Ancestors:**
    For ancestors (pitrus) stuck in the astral plane, rituals like offering *pindad* (rice balls) and specific food items on specific days can satisfy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. These rituals should be performed at specific sacred places like Trimbakeshwar in Nashik, Gaya, or Kashi, not at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

*   **Inner Spiritual Strength and Discernment:**
    Developing inner spiritual strength is the ultimate protection. Yogic practices can help open the Vishnu Granthi (a knot in the spiritual body) or Rudra Granthi (another knot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Activating these allows one to enter a pure inner space where deities reside, a space that lower entities like Bhoots or Pishachas cannot enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. An individual who has activated these is protected, even if standing amidst a hundred Asuras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Discernment is also vital to avoid being misled by entities posing as deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

*   **Caution against Curiosity:**
    It is advised not to enter into occult practices or contact entities out of mere curiosity, as this can lead to severe problems not just for the individual but also for those connected to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Trained exorcists, by contrast, know how to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The path to spiritual protection, especially within [[role_and_practice_of_Tantra_and_Sadhana | Tantra]], involves dedicated [[concepts_of_deity_worship_in_Tantra | deity worship]] (upasana), the guidance of a genuine Guru, and disciplined self-practice. This builds inner strength and a protective aura that wards off negative influences. While various entities exist across different planes, a strong spiritual foundation is the key to navigating these realms safely and progressing towards higher spiritual states.

Finding [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | motivation]] to study for exams is a common challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It's a universal truth that students generally do not enjoy the process of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]], preferring to relax, watch television, or play games instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] is a constant that cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Changing Your Perspective

What can be changed is your [[changing_perspective_towards_studying | perspective towards studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Instead of seeing it as a boring obligation, view [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] as a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> [!quote] Muhammad Ali's Perspective
> Muhammad Ali, a legendary boxer, once said he "hated every single minute of training." He told himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This mindset directly applies to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

While Muhammad Ali trained to face other formidable opponents, your biggest opponent in the process of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] for exams, and in life, is yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Hunger for Success

Students who excel in their exams dislike [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] just as much as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They are not necessarily smarter or more talented, but they possess a greater hunger for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This internal [[selfmotivation_and_internal_confidence | hunger]] is what you truly need to cultivate for [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | exam motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Studying for Your Future Self

Do not [[studying_for_selfimprovement | study]] to impress parents, friends, or for high marks and future pay packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Your primary reason for [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] should be for the future version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Aim to put yourself in a position where you don't have to worry about failing or getting bad marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Train so diligently that you are confident in knowing every answer, regardless of what the exam paper asks, performing like a heavyweight champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Champion's Choice

When faced with the option to skip a difficult paragraph or questions that friends are omitting, ask yourself: do you simply want to pass, or do you want to place yourself in the best possible position for your future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>

*   **Choose the harder path:** Always opt for the more challenging route when given the choice to skip a part of your [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **[[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | Discipline]]**: [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | Discipline]] is defined as choosing what you want the most over what you want now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Give 110%**: In moments of laziness, when you have the option to give less than your best, choose instead to give 110% effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Internal Motivation**: Pull effort and [[importance_of_selfbelief_and_motivation | motivation]] from deep inside yourself, not for external validation, but solely for your own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Ultimately, you have a choice: to be remembered as another "heavyweight boxer" who lost battles against yourself, or to be remembered as the greatest of all time when it comes to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] and working towards your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The first rule of life is "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

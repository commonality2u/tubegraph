From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

The term "mythology" often offends many people in India, stemming from the historical context where imperialist Europeans labeled Indian culture and history as untrue or mythical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some parts of India categorize texts like the [[analysis_of_mahabharat_and_ramayan | Ramayan]], [[analysis_of_mahabharat_and_ramayan | Mahabharat]], Vishnu Puran, and Shiv Puran under "mythology," the speaker personally prefers to refer to these as [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | Indian history]] and [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Importance of Understanding Ancient Indian Knowledge

There is a perceived lack of knowledge about [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] among the youth and even older generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Conversations with experts like Amish Tripathi and Dr. Vinit Agarwal are crucial for both generations to learn more about this subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The discussion extends beyond the [[analysis_of_mahabharat_and_ramayan | Ramayan]] and [[analysis_of_mahabharat_and_ramayan | Mahabharat]], encompassing various topics such as science fiction-like elements (e.g., Vimanas), astronomy, and descriptions of monsters, Rakshasas, and Asuras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Dr. Vinit Agarwal, an expert in Hindu culture, [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | Indian history]], and ancient sciences, highlights the lost historical records of India due to invasions over the last 1,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He suggests that ancient India (around 1 BC or 2 BC) was likely even more knowledgeable than it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

> "There's a disconnect between the civilization, the knowledge, the civilizational knowledge rather that we had and how you see people behaving today. There's a huge disconnect because people are not aware of their own culture, their own history, their own civilizational values." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

Ancient Indian cities, like those of the Indus-Saraswati civilization, were among the most well-planned in the world, contrasting with the current struggles of modern Indian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This decline is attributed to a lack of interest in exploring the knowledge embedded in [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient Hindu culture]] and [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, there is a rising interest in [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | Indian history]] and [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Interpretation of Ancient Texts: Science and Open-Mindedness

To understand the "science or science fiction aspects" of [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient culture]], an open mind is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While criticisms and doubts about the historicity of epics and legends exist, the focus should be on the lessons and knowledge derived from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Approaching these texts with a scientific outlook means questioning everything, which is a core principle of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. [[Ancient Hindu culture and its scientific aspects | Indian scriptures]], starting with the Rig Veda, emphasize curiosity and the journey of knowing more about the world, oneself, and the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

> "The very beginning of [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian scriptures]] with the Rig Veda, it's the beauty of curiosity. So I would say [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian religion]] has always been about curiosity. It is about knowing more, trying to find out more about the world, about yourself, about God, the creator of the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

### Parallels with Modern Science and Philosophy
Advanced astrophysicists and scientists often gravitate towards Vedanta, finding parallels between complex mathematics and physics and the concepts described in the Vedas and Rig Veda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Aliens, Vimanas, and Intergalactic Wars

Ancient [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] discusses concepts like demons, Vimanas (flying machines), aliens, dark energies, avatars, and atom bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The concept of aliens in [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient Hindu culture]] stems from the curiosity about other worlds and the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Religious stories and mystical visions of "mantra dras" (seers who saw the mantras) describe different realms and planes of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

The Puranas, such as the Shrimad Bhagwat Puran, detail a universe with 14 "Locas" (planes), with Earth being the middle one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The inhabitants of these other Locas are, by definition, aliens, as they did not originate on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Divine beings (Devas) and Asuras are depicted with advanced, scientifically sophisticated civilizations, possessing "outer world technology," divine weapons (like WMDs), and spaceships for inter-Loca travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

> "By definition, because these are Locas, different planets, different galaxies probably in the universe, they they become aliens." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>

An example is the story of Tripurasur, involving three floating cities of Asuras that could only be destroyed when perfectly aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This suggests advanced scientific understanding, potentially involving spaceships or satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The destruction of these cities by Lord Shiva is celebrated as Deva Deepavali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This narrative can be interpreted as "Intergalactic Wars" between "evil aliens versus good aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Cosmology, Hierarchy, and Kalpas

The Vishnu Puran discusses the birth of the universe and "Parab" (God in general) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The hierarchy of Gods, such as God > Vishnu, Brahma, Mahesh (Shiva) > Devis > Indra, etc., is a common question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Different Puranas elevate different gods as supreme (e.g., Shiva Puran for Shiva, Vaishnava Puranas for Vishnu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

The Rig Veda's Purush Sukta describes the "Adi Purush" (first person), from whom creation originates, including Viraj and then Brahma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Alternatively, Shiva Purana describes Shiva emerging as a Lingam of fire, later revealing himself as the supreme creator to Brahma and Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

The key to understanding these differing accounts lies in the concept of "kalpas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Hindu scriptures describe a Multiverse, with millions of inhabited worlds and universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The material universe is just one quadrant of the entire creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

According to Shrimad Bhagwat Puran, a form of Vishnu (Karana Daka Shai Vishnu) lies in the material realm, and every time he exhales, a universe pops out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Each universe then has its own Brahma, who creates its Locas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. The entire existence of one universe is just a single breath of this Mahavishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

Brahma has a lifespan of approximately 311 trillion human years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. Each "day" of Brahma is called a kalpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Within each kalpa, creation happens differently, with different entities being created and different avatars appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. The differences in puranic stories are attributed to their belonging to different kalpas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The Vishnu Puran, for example, is relevant to the current Vaha Kalpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh (Shiva) form the Holy Trinity (Trimurti) and are considered the highest level of gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Shared Histories and Lost Knowledge

The concept of infinite universes in [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | ancient Hindu culture]] parallels modern astrophysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

[[Historical dating of ancient Indian texts | Ancient human history]] suggests that writing began around 10,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens evolved around 70,000-80,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The "cognitive revolution" around 70,000 BC, where sapiens evolved imagination, marked a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. The period between the cognitive revolution and the agricultural revolution (around 10,000 BC) was a time of nomadic experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Theories suggest external inputs or substances like psychedelics (e.g., Ayahuasca, Soma) might have contributed to this cognitive leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### Soma and its Properties
Soma, a highly misunderstood chemical mentioned in the Rig Veda (where the entire ninth Mandala is dedicated to it), was likely an invigorator that triggered an adrenaline rush, rather than a psychedelic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Its description suggests it was extracted from the stalks of a creeper or shrub, then mixed with milk or curd for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Indra, the Thunder God, drank large quantities of Soma before going to war, suggesting its invigorating properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Soma was found in mountain regions like the Himalayas and possibly extended to Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. The Parsi "Homa" ceremony, which involves extracting juice from a plant stock, is similar to the Vedic Soma ceremony, indicating shared roots between Indian and Iranian civilizations, despite their historical antagonism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Ice Ages and Global Floods
The Earth experiences cooling and warming periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a scholar, proposed in his book "The Arctic Home of The Vedas" that some Vedic depictions (like 6-month days and nights, or multiple dawns) suggest the Vedic people or Rishis lived in the Arctic Zone before the Ice Age, when the climate there was more temperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. As the Ice Age intensified, people migrated southward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

The "out of Africa" theory of human origins suggests Homo sapiens emerged in East Africa and migrated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. Genetic studies indicate that populations arriving in India around 60,000 BC were crucial in populating the rest of the world, surviving the Ice Age in tropical zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

During Ice Ages, sea levels drop as water freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. When melting began, coastal civilizations, which typically form near water sources, would have flooded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. This explains the presence of a "global deluge" story across nearly all world mythologies, from Mesopotamia and Sumeria to Native American and Philippine cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.

The Matsya Avatar of Lord Vishnu, where Vishnu in the form of a fish warns Manu about a global flood and instructs him to gather plants, animal species, and the Saptarishis (sages carrying knowledge) to preserve civilization, is India's version of this global flood narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. This highlights the importance of preserving knowledge for the continuation of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

### Threats to Knowledge and Advanced Civilizations
The loss of knowledge due to events like the burning of Nalanda University during invasions, where thousands of books and manuscripts were destroyed, emphasizes the vulnerability of civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Modern technology, like the internet, is also susceptible to threats, such as solar winds, which could lead to a loss of stored information and return to "Dark Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

The presence of "scientific advances" in ancient civilizations, despite not having modern technologies like fossil fuels, does not make them primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. Ancient [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian civilization]] maintained an equilibrium with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

Mentions of Vimanas, like the Pushpak Viman (created by Vishwakarma, architect of the gods) or the flying machine used by King Shalva (created by Mayadanav, architect of the Asuras), suggest advanced flying machines were given to humans by advanced civilizations (Devas and Asuras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Some Vimanas were supposedly powered by a "Mercury Vortex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. The description of a "Sharab," a chimeric creature with features of multiple animals and the ultimate predator, could scientifically represent a dinosaur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. A clear carving of a Stegosaurus on an 11th-century temple wall in Angkor Wat, Cambodia, further supports the idea of ancient knowledge of creatures from much earlier periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## The Kalki Avatar and Universal Messiah
The concept of a returning Messiah or savior, such as the [[kalki_avatar | Kalki Avatar]], is a common thread across many world mythologies and religions, including Norse (Thor), Greek (Zeus), Hindu (Indra), Islam, and Tibetan Buddhism (Kalachakra Kings/Maitreya Buddha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. In [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Hindu timeline]], Kalki is prophesied to return at the end of the Kali Yuga, which is a very distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. This shared narrative across cultures suggests either a common ancient prophecy before humanity fragmented or a universal hope for a better future and an external savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Spirit of Inquiry
The discussion about [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] and its historical context reveals a vast body of knowledge that extends far beyond the well-known epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. Much of this history is likely lost, either burned during invasions or awaiting [[archaeological_findings_related_to_indian_epics | archaeological evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

[[Ancient Hindu culture and its scientific aspects | Indian scriptures]] encourage constant questioning and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. The Rig Veda's Nasadiya Sukta, which ends with the profound thought that even the God who created everything might not know the full truth of creation, embodies this scientific spirit of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. True knowledge, as suggested, lies in the understanding that one knows nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. Spreading this knowledge about [[ancient_hindu_culture_and_its_scientific_aspects | Indian culture]] is a mission to rediscover lost [[historical_and_cultural_evolution_according_to_Hindu_texts | history]] for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

Studying is a constant in life that cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While no student genuinely enjoys the process, preferring to relax, watch television, or play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, what *can* be changed is one's perspective towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Studying as a Boxing Match

Instead of viewing studying as a boring, time-consuming process, consider it akin to a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> "I hated every single minute of training. Every single minute he told himself suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion."

Just like a boxer trains, studying requires effort and enduring discomfort for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### The True Opponent

Unlike boxers who face external opponents, your biggest challenge in studying and in life is yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Successful students, who may not be smarter or more talented, succeed because they are "hungrier" for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The key is to find this inner hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Purpose of Study

Shift your motivation away from external factors:
*   Do not study to impress parents or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Do not study for specific marks, future pay packages, money, or rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Instead, [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | study only for the future version of yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The goal is to train so diligently that you reach a point where you don't worry about [[handling_stress_and_overcoming_failure | failing or getting bad marks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, knowing you can perform like a champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Choosing the Harder Path

When faced with the option to skip difficult sections or questions, always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. [[selfdiscipline_and_study_habits | Discipline]] is the act of choosing what you want the most over what you want in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. In moments of laziness, push yourself to give 110% effort, drawing motivation from deep within yourself, not from external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Ultimately, you are [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying for your own future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The choice is yours: be remembered as an average individual who lost battles against themselves, or as the greatest when it comes to achieving your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Adopt the mindset: "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

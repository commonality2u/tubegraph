## Changing Your Perspective Towards Studying

While many people search for motivation to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | study]] for exams, the truth is that no student genuinely enjoys the process of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] [00:00:26]. Most would prefer to relax, watch television, or play video games [00:00:28]. However, [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] is a constant in life that cannot be changed [00:00:37]. What *can* be changed is one's perspective towards it [00:00:42].

### The "Boxing Match" Analogy

Instead of viewing [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] as a boring, time-consuming process, consider it a boxing match [00:00:47].

> "I hated every single minute of training... I told myself, 'Suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
> â€” Muhammad Ali

Just as Muhammad Ali trained to face the greatest heavyweight boxers, your "training" (studying) prepares you for your future [00:01:19].

#### Your Biggest Opponent

In the process of [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] for exams and in life, your biggest opponent is yourself [00:01:29]. Successful students dislike [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] as much as anyone else, but they possess a greater hunger for success [00:01:40]. Instead of being an average student, aspire to train for a championship [00:01:59].

### The True Motivation for Studying

Do not [[studying_for_selfimprovement | study]] to please your parents, impress friends, chase marks, or earn a future pay package [00:02:09]. Avoid [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] for money or external rewards [00:02:16].

> [!NOTE]
> [[studying_for_selfimprovement | Study]] for one thing only: the future version of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Aim to place yourself in a position where you won't worry about failing or receiving bad marks [00:02:28]. Train so diligently that you are confident in knowing every answer on an exam paper, performing like a heavyweight champion [00:02:36].

### Embracing Discipline

When faced with the option to skip a paragraph or a few questions, ask yourself if you merely want to pass or if you want to be in the best possible position for your future [00:02:47]. Always choose the harder path [00:03:07].

> Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want the most. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>

In moments of laziness, where you could give less than your best, choose to give 110% effort [00:03:14]. Pull out motivation and effort from a deep, internal place, not for the external world, but for yourself [00:03:26]. Remember, you are only [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] for your own future [00:03:31]. This is key to [[overcoming_distractions_and_maintaining_focus | overcoming distractions and maintaining focus]].

### Championship Mindset

You have the choice: be remembered as an average boxer who lost battles against yourself, or as the greatest of all time when it comes to [[studying_for_selfimprovement | studying]] and working towards your goals [00:03:39]. The rule of life is "Championship or nothing" [00:03:53].

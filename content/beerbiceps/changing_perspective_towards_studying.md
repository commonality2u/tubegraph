It is a common truth that most students do not enjoy the process of studying; they would rather relax, watch television, or play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, studying is a constant in life that cannot be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. What *can* be changed is one's [[developing_a_positive_mindset | perspective]] towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Studying as a Boxing Match

Instead of viewing studying as a boring obligation, it can be approached as a boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali famously stated that he "hated every single minute of training," but he endured it by telling himself to "suffer now and live the rest of your life a champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This mindset applies directly to studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### The Opponent Within

While Muhammad Ali trained to face the greatest heavyweight boxers, students face a different kind of opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The biggest opponent in the process of studying for exams, and in life, is oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The reflection in the mirror represents this opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Students who perform well in exams often dislike studying as much as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They are not necessarily smarter or more talented, but they possess a greater "hunger" for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. [[preparing_for_opportunities | Finding this hunger within oneself]] is crucial for [[developing_a_positive_mindset | exam motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The goal should be to train like a champion, preparing for a championship, rather than just being an average performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Why Study? The Future Self

The motivation for studying should not be external rewards or expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:
*   Not for parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Not to impress friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   Not for marks or future pay packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Not for money or rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

The sole purpose of studying should be for the [[studying_for_personal_growth_and_future_self | future version of oneself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The aim is to study so diligently that when results are checked, there is no worry about failing or getting poor marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. By training hard, one can be confident in knowing every answer and performing like a heavyweight champion, regardless of the exam content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Choosing the Harder Path

There will be moments when it's tempting to skip a paragraph or a few questions because friends are doing so, and it seems enough to just pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In these moments, it's essential to ask whether the goal is merely to pass or to place oneself in the best possible position for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

When faced with the option of skipping a difficult part of a chapter or a question, always choose the harder path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. [[selfdiscipline_and_studying | Discipline]] is defined as choosing what is wanted "the most" over what is wanted "now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. During moments of laziness, where there's a choice between not giving 100% or giving 100%, choose to give 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Pull effort and motivation from within, not for the external world, but for oneself and one's own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Ultimately, the choice is whether to be remembered as an average contender who lost battles against oneself, or as "the greatest of all time" when it comes to studying and working towards a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The guiding principle should be "Championship or nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

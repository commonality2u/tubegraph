Kareena Kapoor Khan reflects on how motherhood and being a wife have significantly impacted her personal growth and career trajectory. She openly discusses the challenges and joys of balancing her professional life with her family responsibilities, and the influence her own mother had on her upbringing and perspective.

## Impact of Motherhood and Marriage
Kareena Kapoor Khan states that her growth as a person between the ages of 20 and 43 has been profound, directly attributing this to [[family_influences_on_kareena_kapoor_khans_career_decisions | motherhood]] and being a wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. She feels these roles have brought a different kind of responsibility into her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. She no longer chases the singular goal of success or box office hits as she did in her 20s, where proving herself as a good actor and star was everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Now, her mind has expanded, and her husband and children have helped her grow into the person she is and hopes to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Balancing Life and Career
The demands of her profession mean that even when battling a fever or dealing with personal issues, she must maintain a perfect star persona for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. Despite the challenges, she emphasizes that the most demanding aspect of her job is the "craft," requiring 200 percent effort regardless of external circumstances, even if someone close to her is dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. The other aspects, like events and promotions, she considers unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

She expresses that while she is now at peace, she is still "hungry for more" in her career, a feeling of "I can do that, but I can do this film, but I can do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. This hunger keeps her on her toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. She clarifies that this drive is for her own satisfaction and happiness, not to prove anything to her children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## Parental Guidance and Upbringing
Kareena believes her mother greatly contributed to her personality and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Her mother, being very self-made and strong, ensured a basic and simple upbringing, even dropping her off at the school bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Her mother still doesn't understand the paparazzi culture and focuses on her acting performance rather than external fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

Her mother was particularly influential in her sister Karishma's career, especially as Karishma was the first in the family to work at 14, and women with "light eyes" were not thought to succeed in Bollywood at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Kareena feels lucky to have had this guidance by observing her sister's journey from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

Regarding her own children, Kareena does not wish for them to become actors at this early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. She and her husband, Saif Ali Khan, are both strong, individual parents who believe their children should make their own decisions and "fly their own journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. Her main advice to them currently is simply "don't fight with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>, as she observes their strong individual personalities and sibling dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

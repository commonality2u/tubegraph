The [[cricket_administration_and_management_insights | administrative]] aspect of cricket in India has been a key factor in the country's dominance in the sport internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has seen its former players transition into administrative roles, which is considered beneficial because players understand how to manage other players best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. India is setting a trend where former players are increasingly involved in administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## IPL's Growth and Current Status
The Indian Premier League (IPL) has significantly contributed to the professionalism and fan experience within Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The league has seen expansion, with two more teams added, bringing the total number of teams to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Women's IPL
The Women's IPL is actively in the process of being prepared and is scheduled to launch next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Future Outlook for the IPL
While there is interest in expanding the IPL to an NBA-style league with many more teams, the current challenge is the existing window for [[the_pressure_and_challenges_of_international_cricket | international cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. The Indian team has a packed schedule with global tours, bilaterals, Tests, and International T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

As a fan, the current balance of the IPL is considered good, as there is no greater honor than playing for one's country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. The IPL, along with the national and state teams, helps maintain the relevance of former players in the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

## Fan Experience and Professionalism
There is a strong desire to bring the sophisticated fan experience observed in global football leagues, like those in England, to cricket in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. In places like Manchester, football matches are a full-day experience for fans, with activities starting hours before the game, including player interactions, hospitality, and discussions with club stalwarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This culture, where fans are deeply involved and influencing club decisions, is gradually being adopted by Indian sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Cricket's Cultural Impact in India
Cricket in India experienced a significant boom following the 1983 World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Since 1996, cricket stadiums in India have consistently been packed, a trend that continues today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Cricket is considered an immortal sport in India, wielding cultural impact that surpasses even [[the_evolution_of_stardom_and_bollywood_industry_changes | Bollywood fame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. The sport teaches invaluable life lessons, making it one of the biggest teachers in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

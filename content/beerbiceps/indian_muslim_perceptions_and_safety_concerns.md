There are varying perspectives on the safety and integration of Muslims within India, particularly concerning the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and historical political influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

## Historical Political Influence

From the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, there has been a deliberate attempt to create a situation where Muslims felt safe primarily with the Congress party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. The Congress party allegedly pampered Muslims, providing them with "goodies" and ensuring police were well-disposed towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. This approach, however, inadvertently contributed to the consolidation of Hindus, leading to the rise of the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

## Safety Concerns and Political Affiliation

A central concern for the average Indian Muslim is their physical or emotional safety in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

While some fear potential Hindu-Muslim riots, it is argued that if the BJP is in power, such riots will not flare up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. Conversely, it is suggested that if the Congress party were in power, they would be responsible for igniting such conflicts, with historical research reports supporting this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

Many Muslims are part of the BJP, serving as Members of Parliament and ministers at both central and state levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. The current focus of Hindus is on the Renaissance within Hinduism and reforming Hindus, rather than persecuting Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

However, external nations bordering India actively work to create division between Hindus and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. For example, Maldives, a Muslim country, has adopted an "extreme Muslim stance" against India, even bringing in Chinese troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. In contrast, Iran, with its Shia population, is well-disposed towards India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Hardline Muslim groups are accused of fostering a narrative that Muslims are persecuted and cannot trust Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

## Inter-religious Relationships

Personal experiences highlight the nuanced nature of inter-religious relations:
*   A daughter married a Muslim man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. She had the right to choose her spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.
*   The marriage ceremony itself did not include Muslim rites, with the engagement performed by Arya Samaj priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
*   The son-in-law's father, Salman Haider, was an atheist/non-believer who dismissed religious rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.
*   The individual's Parsi wife faced a "revolt" from her community when they married, unlike his Hindu relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. He himself married his Parsi wife at Harvard with a Buddhist priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>, viewing marriage technicalities as less important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
*   It is asserted that all Indian Muslims share the same DNA as Hindus, meaning their ancestors were Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>, and on the ground, Muslims and Hindus share similar cultural practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>.

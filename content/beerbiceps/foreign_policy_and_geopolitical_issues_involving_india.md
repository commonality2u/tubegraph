Dr. Subramanian Swamy shares his perspectives on [[Indias foreign policy | India's foreign policy]] and [[Indias geopolitical influence | India's geopolitical influence]], particularly concerning relationships with China, Russia, and the United States, as well as India's overall standing in the international arena.

## Challenges in India's Geopolitical Stance

Dr. Swamy criticizes Prime Minister Modi's approach to [[Indias foreign policy | foreign policy]], alleging dishonesty regarding Chinese incursions. He asserts that the Prime Minister has denied Chinese presence in Indian territory, which Swamy claims is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He further states that 4,065 square kilometers of Ladakh have been occupied by China since 2020, questioning why the Prime Minister remains silent on the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### [[IndiaChina Geopolitical Tensions and Historical Conflicts | India-China Relations]]

Dr. Swamy believes that the Chinese are "up to swallowing a good part of your territory" and aim to show the world that India is not a significant global factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. He suggests that India should militarily defeat the Chinese, believing they would "run from here" as they did in 1967 (Nathu La Pass, Sikkim) and 1988 (Sumdorong Chu Valley, Arunachal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. He dismisses the concept of a "buffer zone" agreed upon by India, stating it is drawn within India's claimed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. He argues that India should demand the Chinese Ambassador withdraw until occupied territories are cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. He claims the lack of strong action from India is due to Prime Minister Modi being "blackmailed" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.

On the topic of Kailash Mansarovar, Dr. Swamy states that he was the first Indian to facilitate its opening after it was closed since 1935 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. He notes it is currently closed due to tensions between the countries but believes it will reopen if relations improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

### India-Russia Relations

Dr. Swamy states that Prime Minister Modi has "sold out to the Russians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>, questioning why India buys "all kinds of junk from Russia" and engages in Rupee-Ruble trade without standard exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. He views Russian President Putin as a "servant of the Chinese," suggesting Putin would not act against China's wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

### India-US Relations

Dr. Swamy identifies the United States as an ally, particularly within the Quad alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. He also notes that the US has decided to prosecute Mr. Adani for activities that were not known in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

### Other Nations

Dr. Swamy mentions that some bordering nations actively try to create discord between Hindus and Muslims in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. He cites Maldives as an example, a Muslim country that, despite being saved by India from terrorists, is now giving India "lectures" and has brought in the Chinese troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. He also highlights Iran, a Shia Muslim country, as being "very well disposed" towards India, noting the sympathy of the Shia population in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## India's Global Standing and Aspirations

Dr. Swamy believes India is "potentially the first factor" in the global landscape, although currently, he places its standing at "less than third," even suggesting there is "more respect for France today than there's for India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. To achieve its potential, he advises India to grow at 10% per year for another five years through economic policy changes and to militarily defeat the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. He is "100% certain" that India will become a great country, recovering its lost land and achieving high economic growth with the right leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. He believes India can "easily overtake China" within five to six years to be among the top two global powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

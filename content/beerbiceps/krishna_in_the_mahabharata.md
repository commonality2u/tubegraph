Krishna's role in the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Mahabharata]] marks a significant turning point in [[the_life_of_krishna|his]] life, characterized by a display of [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] divine wisdom and strategic prowess, known as *Aishwarya Leelas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>. Unlike [[analysis_of_mahabharat_and_ramayan|Rama]], who largely pretended to be a man, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] openly manifested [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] glory and divinity from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

## Transition from Brindavan to the Battlefield

After leaving [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Brindavan]] and [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Gokul]] to slay [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Kamsa]] in Mathura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna's]] *leelas* (divine plays) shifted from the "Madura Leelas" (sweet, charming plays) of [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|his]] youth to "Aishwarya Leelas," where [[Vishnu and His Avatars|he]] displayed [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] inherent divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>. This change marked the point where the *[[The Life of Krishna|Bhagavat Puranam]]* story of [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] intersected with the *[[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Mahabharata]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

## Krishna's Strategic Role

[[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] is depicted as an expert strategizer, not seeking peaceful mediation between the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Pandavas]] and [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Kauravas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>. [[Vishnu and His Avatars|His]] primary purpose was to "wipe the earth clean of all those kings that are living *adharmic*" (unrighteous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. [[Vishnu and His Avatars|He]] utilized the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Pandavas]] and [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Kauravas]] as a pretext for this grand purging of unrighteous forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16">[01:48:16]</a>.

[[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] served as a mentor and counsel to the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Pandavas]], constantly advising them on strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>, but [[Vishnu and His Avatars|he]] remained a *sarathi* (charioteer) and did not take up arms [[Vishnu and His Avatars|himself]] during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>.

## Key Interactions and Teachings

During the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Mahabharata]] War, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna's]] fierce and direct side became evident:

*   **[[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Karna]]:** [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] ensured [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Karna]] was on the side of the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Kauravas]], explaining that [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Karna's]] inherent negative force needed to be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:09">[01:54:09]</a>. [[the_life_of_krishna|He]] held [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Karna]] accountable for his *adharmic* actions, such as suggesting the public disrobing of [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Draupadi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>.
*   **[[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Dronacharya]] and [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Ashwathama]]:** [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] orchestrated a plan to demoralize [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Dronacharya]] by having the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Pandavas]] declare that "Ashwadthama has been killed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:13">[01:57:13]</a>. When [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Yudishthira]] hesitated to lie, whispering that it was the elephant Ashwathama, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] rebuked [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|him]], emphasizing accountability and the subtle nature of Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.
*   **Bhagavad Gita:** [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna's]] ultimate expression of divinity during the war came in the Bhagavad Gita, "the song of the Lord," spanning 18 chapters and 700 *shlokas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:15">[02:10:15]</a>. [[Vishnu and His Avatars|He]] declared that those who believe [[Vishnu and His Avatars|he]] is everything and dedicate their all to [[Vishnu and His Avatars|him]] will have [[Vishnu and His Avatars|their]] constant welfare taken care of, without a single second's break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Post-Mahabharata Period

Little is commonly known about the 36 years following the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Mahabharata]] War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. These events are mentioned in the *[[The Life of Krishna|Mahabharatam]]* itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:21">[02:03:21]</a>.

*   **[[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Gandhari's]] Curse:** At the end of the war, [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Gandhari]], mother of the [[Mahabharat and its geographical spread|Kauravas]], consumed by grief over the death of all her sons, cursed [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>. She accused [[the_life_of_krishna|him]] of causing the destruction and cursed [[the_life_of_krishna|him]] to die silently by a hunter's arrow, without respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:44">[02:05:44]</a>. [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] smilingly accepted the curse, stating that it was how [[Vishnu and His Avatars|he]] had already chosen to depart, and that [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Gandhari]] had wasted her accumulated *tapas* (spiritual penance) on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>.

*   **Destruction of the [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Yadu]] Clan:** Following the war, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] retired to [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Dwaraka]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>. [[Vishnu and His Avatars|He]] then witnessed the gradual self-destruction of [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|his]] own clan, the [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Yadu]]s, due to their internal bickering and misdeeds, which was also an extension of [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Gandhari's]] curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:49">[02:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>.

*   **[[Final Days of Krishnas Life|Krishna's]] Departure:** After witnessing these events and fulfilling [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] purpose, [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]] went into a forest in [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Dwaraka]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:22">[02:08:22]</a>. While meditating, a hunter mistook [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] outstretched foot for a deer's ear and shot [[Vishnu and His Avatars|him]] with a poisoned arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:27">[02:08:27]</a>. This marked the end of [[the_life_of_krishna|his]] earthly *avatar*, as [[Vishnu and His Avatars|he]] returned to [[Vishnu and His Avatars|his]] eternal abode, [[Vishnu and His Avatars|Goloka]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>. Prior to this, [[the_life_of_krishna|he]] instructed [[birth_and_childhood_of_krishna|Balarama]] to return, who became a white snake and slithered into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.

This period encapsulates [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna's]] role as a "conscience keeper" for the universe, demonstrating that actions, whether good or bad, determine one's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a>. For those who come in contact with [[the_life_of_krishna|Krishna]], it is believed to be their "last *janma*" (birth), signifying liberation from the cycle of *samsara* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

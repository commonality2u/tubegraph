Indian men often deal with [[natural_skincare_remedies_for_dry_and_oily_skin | oily skin]] and acne issues, partly due to the country's high humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Looking clean and tidy is key to being perceived as handsome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Basic Face Cleansing: The Foundation

A fundamental step in maintaining good skin is basic face cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The first weapon against an oily appearance is a basic mild face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Why Wash Your Face?
*   A mild face wash helps in getting rid of all the oil on your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Accumulation of oil on the skin increases the total amount of pimples you might get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Young men in their teens or early twenties, especially those who go to the gym, are more prone to acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### How to Wash Your Face
1.  Rub the face wash between your hands to make it a little bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  Spread it all over your face and neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
3.  Ensure the face wash is rubbed deep into your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
4.  Wash it off with tepid (room temperature) water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   Washing off excess oil and sebum will make your face look much cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Frequency
Washing your face twice a day—once in the morning right after waking up, and once at night one or two hours before bedtime—can significantly prevent and minimize acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is suitable for everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Bonus Skincare Routine for Special Occasions

For an important office meeting or a party, when you want to look extra neat and avoid looking oily or grungy, a bonus skincare routine can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Moisturizer and Baby Powder
*   **Moisturizer**: Use a basic moisturizer to rehydrate your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   For those with oily skin, it's not recommended to use moisturizer every day, as excessive use can block pores and cause more acne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Baby Powder**: Opt for baby powder instead of regular talcum powder because it has very fine granules that are less likely to block pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Using too much baby powder can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   If you apply too much, wipe it down with a slightly wet cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

This combination can make a subtle difference in how oily your skin looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. It's the closest thing to makeup for men that helps achieve a polished look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Remember, like with [[Basic Skincare Routine for Different Skin Types | fitness]], you need to figure out your own [[Importance of Personalized Skincare | skincare routine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

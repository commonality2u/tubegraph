The period of Mao Zedong's rule in China was characterized by intense psychological manipulation and indoctrination, shaping the thoughts and behaviors of hundreds of millions of people. This article, based on an interview with Jung Chang, explores the mechanisms and impacts of these psychological strategies.

## Core Mechanisms of Indoctrination

Several key mechanisms were employed to ensure the populace adhered to the Party line and revered Mao.

### Deification of Mao
Mao Zedong was elevated to a god-like status. Children were taught that Mao was akin to a god, and to affirm the truth of a statement, people would say, "I swear to Chairman Mao" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This deification made questioning Mao not just politically dangerous, but psychologically almost inconceivable for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Even after experiencing the horrors of the Cultural Revolution, it took Jung Chang eight years from doubting the system to directly holding Mao responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This reverence was systematically instilled from childhood, with later generations also taught to regard Mao as god-like through the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

### Isolation and Information Control
A crucial element of the brainwashing process was the complete isolation of Chinese society from the outside world and any alternative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. China had been closed to the outside world since the Communists took power in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This meant no access to different perspectives or facts that contradicted the Party narrative.
Even parents refrained from sharing dissenting thoughts with their children, fearing the disastrous consequences for the child and the family if such thoughts were repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This practice continued, with parents who experienced Mao's era often not telling their children about their negative experiences, leaving the younger generation with no alternative information to the official line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

### The Role of Terror
Intense terror was a fundamental tool for psychological control. The constant threat of political campaigns, purges, and severe punishment for questioning Mao or the Party line scared people into suppressing any unorthodox thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The Cultural Revolution, described as a "Great Purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, exemplified this, where denunciation meetings, torture, and public humiliation were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Exploitation of Human Nature

Mao demonstrated a keen understanding of how to manipulate human psychology by exploiting certain aspects of human nature. During the Cultural Revolution, he gave license to young people, the Red Guards, to indulge destructive and sadistic instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. By unleashing these "bad things in their nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, he created widespread chaos and terror, which served his political ends of purging opponents and consolidating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Teachers, for instance, became early targets to arouse the violent passions of the young Red Guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

## Techniques of Psychological Warfare

Mao employed specific techniques that amounted to psychological warfare against his own population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Forced Confessions and Self-Criticism
A key tactic was forcing victims to incriminate themselves through confessions and self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. These practices were designed to humiliate and break individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>. Regular criticism and self-criticism meetings stirred up profound discomfort and unsettling feelings, effectively breaking people's spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>.

### Atomization of Society
These practices also served to atomize society by turning people against each other. Criticizing others created widespread animosities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>, making it impossible for organized opposition to form as individuals dared not trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.
Even familial bonds were targeted. Expressing "warm feeling-ism," or affection for one's family, could be grounds for criticism, as it implied loyalty to family over Mao and the Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. Deng Xiaoping, when appealing for his crippled son, had to preface his request by acknowledging he might be committing "warm feeling-ism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

### Imposition of Immoral Choices
The system often forced individuals into terrible moral dilemmas. For example, quota systems during purges, where officials were required to identify a certain percentage of "capitalist roaders" or "rightists" (e.g., 5%) in their department, compelled them to denounce innocent people to save themselves or their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:53">[01:25:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>. This was another weapon to break people psychologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

## Persistence of Indoctrination
Despite the suffering, the effects of indoctrination could persist. Jung Chang notes that some individuals who experienced similar hardships still praised Mao or wished for a return to aspects of the Mao era, possibly due to being more thoroughly indoctrinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>. For children of high officials, identifying Mao with the Communist Party's rule, from which they benefited, could also play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. The fading of painful memories over generations and the lack of alternative narratives for those who grew up without direct suffering also contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Furthermore, a pragmatic desire among the Chinese people to avoid trouble reinforces conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

Mao's rise to power and his impact on China ([Mao's rise to power and his impact on China](maos_rise_to_power_and_his_impact_on_china)) was not only a matter of political maneuvering but also deeply connected to the cultural and psychological manipulation of his time. The [[impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society | impact of Mao Zedong's policies on Chinese society]] through indoctrination parallels broader discussions on how leadership is influenced by historical precedent and the persistence of cultural narrative, echoing thoughts found in [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]].

In a discussion about the new book *Buffett and Munger Unscripted*, there is a significant focus on the theme of curiosity and its role in creating what might superficially be seen as "luck". The book compiles decades of insights from the [[the_role_of_curiosity_and_continuous_learning_in_investing | Berkshire Hathaway]] annual shareholder meetings, highlighting the perspectives of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, as curated by Alex Morris.

## Curiosity and Its Rewards

Charlie Munger emphasizes the value of curiosity by recounting Warren Buffett’s experience discovering Geico. Buffett attributes his 'luck' in finding Geico to curiosity-driven actions, such as knocking on doors of empty buildings in Washington D.C. at the age of 21. Munger notes that not every young adult would have pursued such inquisitive explorations, and credits their 'self-made luck' to their persistent curiosity and quest for wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Buffett further asserts that enjoyment in one’s work often leads to better outcomes. He argues that working out of passion rather than obligation creates better results. This notion is in alignment with themes explored in related topics such as [[the_importance_of_following_your_passion | the importance of following your passion]] and the [[the_importance_of_selfbelief_and_optimism_in_business | importance of self-belief and optimism in business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Creation of Luck Through Intense Interest

Both Munger and Buffett share the belief that intense interest in any subject is crucial for excelling in that area. Naval Ravikant, whose views echo those of Buffett and Munger, suggests that someone with 100% commitment to a subject will significantly outperform those who are less engaged. This idea is reflected in Munger’s statement: "Intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're going to excel in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Moreover, [[importance_of_mindset_and_attitude_in_entrepreneurship | mindset and attitude in entrepreneurship]] is critically linked to curiosity, as it drives a continuous pursuit of knowledge and improvement, leading to success.

## Learning from Role Models

Having role models within and outside one’s family also plays a crucial part in developing successful habits and attitudes. For Buffett, his father was a hero, and for Munger, his grandfather demonstrated sound judgment and financial strength, helping the family survive the Great Depression. Such examples reinforce the value of having admirable attributes passed from one generation to the next—a theme explored in [[lessons_from_sam_zell_on_entrepreneurship_and_curiosity | lessons from Sam Zell on entrepreneurship and curiosity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

Curiosity is not just a passive trait; it is actively fostered through deliberate practice, leading individuals to create their own luck. Whether by following uncharted paths or seeking out heroes and mentors, the pursuit of knowledge and insistence on understanding the world can lead to extraordinary outcomes. The stories and insights shared by Buffett and Munger in their shareholder meetings, as captured in *Buffett and Munger Unscripted*, offer profound lessons on how curiosity, coupled with strategic thinking, forms the bedrock of sustained success.

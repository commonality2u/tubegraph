Michael Ovitz's career in Hollywood is a compelling tale of ambition, innovation, and the shaping of the entertainment industry. Known for his role as a co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Ovitz's influence extended across various domains in Hollywood, positioning him as one of the most powerful figures in the entertainment industry.

## Early Ambitions and the Founding of CAA

Ovitz's journey began with a deep-rooted desire to escape the confines of a modest upbringing in the San Fernando Valley. Influenced by his grandmother's faith in the American dream, Ovitz was determined to carve his path in Hollywood, despite lacking a direct way in. His career in Hollywood started in the mailroom at William Morris, one of the largest talent agencies at the time. Dissatisfied with the slow advancement opportunities and the company's nepotistic culture, Ovitz pursued a more ambitious path.

In 1975, Ovitz, along with a few other young agents, left William Morris to establish the Creative Artists Agency (CAA). They pooled resources, putting up their homes as collateral, and set up operations with a single assistant, serving as a prototypical startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Their vision was to rapidly grow CAA by sharing clients and resources, focusing on teamwork rather than internal competition, and creating opportunities rather than simply fielding offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## Innovations and Breakthroughs

A key aspect of Ovitz's success was his ability to innovate within the rigid frameworks of Hollywood's entertainment industry. Ovitz revolutionized the way Hollywood operated by packaging projects and leveraging the collective power of CAA's assets to shift influence from the studios to the artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>.

One of Ovitz's strategies was his dedication to understanding films and their components. He watched every Oscar-winning film from 1929 onwards to be able to converse intelligently with directors like Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. This method allowed him not only to attract but to retain top talent.

Ovitz also redefined the role of an agent by becoming a deal adviser, facilitating large mergers such as the purchase of MCA Universal by Panasonic for $6.5 billion, which earned CAA a significant fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

## The Impact and Challenges

Ovitz's success at CAA elevated him to a legendary status within the industry. However, his aggressive drive for success also led to challenges, including internal conflicts. Co-founder Ron Meyer, once his best friend and key to CAA's internal dynamics, left the agency for MCA, triggering Ovitz to reconsider his position at CAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>.

Eventually, Ovitz left CAA and accepted a position at Disney as Michael Eisner's number two, which ended in a turbulent fallout and his departure from Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>.

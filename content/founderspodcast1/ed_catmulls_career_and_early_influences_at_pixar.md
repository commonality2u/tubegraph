## Arrival in Silicon Valley

Ed Catmull first entered the film business in 1979, recruited by George Lucas to integrate high technology into the film industry following the success of Star Wars. This appointment placed Catmull at the heart of a dynamic and volatile period in Silicon Valley, providing him with a front-row seat to observe the rise and fall of numerous hardware and software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His mission at Lucasfilm was to merge moviemaking with technology, an endeavor that exposed him to the leadership and innovations of companies like Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Learning from Silicon Valley's Successes and Failures

Catmull noted a recurring pattern among Silicon Valley startups: a cycle of creative ideas receiving funding, leading to rapid success, followed by missteps that led to their downfall. This understanding drove Catmull to question how smart people could make decisions that derailed their successful companies. His observations instilled a desire to protect Pixar from similar fates and foster a sustainable creative culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

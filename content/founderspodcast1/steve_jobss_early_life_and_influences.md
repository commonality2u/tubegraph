## Early Life and Parental Influence

Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955. From a young age, Steve was deeply influenced by his father, Paul Jobs, a lower-middle-class mechanic and craftsman. Paul built furniture and rebuilt cars on weekends, instilling in Steve the paramount value of craftsmanship and pride in one's work.

### Silicon Valley Roots

Growing up in an area that would later be known as Silicon Valley immensely impacted Steve's worldview. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a blossoming of semiconductor, telecommunications, and electronics companies, drawing highly educated engineers and programmers to the region.

Steve learned from his father to see the world differently: everything around was built by someone else, and those mysteries could be unlocked and improved upon. This realization laid the groundwork for his future endeavors, among which was the creation of Apple alongside [[lessons_from_successful_entrepreneurs_like_brad_jacobs_and_steve_jobs | Steve Wozniak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>.

Long-term thinking is a strategic mindset that focuses on sustained growth and resilience over time instead of short-term gains. This approach, famously advocated by Jeff Bezos in his [[longterm_thinking_and_customer_focus_at_amazon | shareholder letters]], is critical for building enduring businesses and achieving success in ever-changing markets.

## Jeff Bezos’s Perspective

The foundation of Amazon’s strategy is long-term thinking. Bezos has articulated this philosophy since the company's early days, writing in his very first shareholder letter that it’s "all about the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>. He routinely emphasizes the importance of focusing on long-term shareholder value rather than short-term financial metrics.

## Key Principles of Long-term Thinking

### Investment in Customer Experience

A commitment to investing heavily in introductions and improved experiences for new and existing customers underscores a long-term vision. Bezos wrote, "We will continue to invest heavily in introductions to new customers" as part of a broader strategy to deliver lasting value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03">[27:03]</a>.

This approach mirrors his belief in [[longterm_thinking_and_customer_focus_at_amazon | customer obsession]] and the idea that focusing relentlessly on customers aligns perfectly with shareholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39">[43:39]</a>.

### Patience as a Competitive Advantage

Long-term thinking allows companies to be patient with their growth strategies. Bezos highlighted Amazon’s culture of patience and its notable support for small businesses with significant potential—a quality that serves as a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19">[52:19]</a>.

### Learning from Failures

Bezos argues that the size of a company's failures should scale alongside its success. This approach ensures the potential for breakthroughs and innovation, essential aspects of long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[36:12]</a>.

### Obsession with a Mission

A long-term outlook involves dedicating efforts to a mission larger than personal or immediate gains. Bezos articulated that leaders should focus on creating a legacy that they can be proud to describe to their grandchildren, thus fostering a long-lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12">[16:12]</a>.

### Invention and Experimentation

Bezos’s philosophy includes a willingness to experiment boldly, knowing that not all will succeed. His idea of "wandering" is integral to uncovering new, nonlinear solutions that short-term thinking might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01">[12:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

In the long run, embracing long-term thinking can determine a company's ability to innovate, grow, and sustain itself in dynamic markets. As exemplified by Bezos’s Amazon, this mindset not only aids in navigating immediate challenges but also in creating a resilient and enduring company legacy.

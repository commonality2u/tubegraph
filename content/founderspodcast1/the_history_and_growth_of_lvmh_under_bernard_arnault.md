## The Rise of Bernard Arnault

Bernard Arnault's ascent at LVMH began just before his 40th birthday when he took control of the company, becoming the chairman of the most expensive company in France at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Arnault's business acumen was first honed in his family business, where his influence led to the sale of his father's building company, setting the pathway for his investment in LVMH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Seizing Control of LVMH

LVMH was the result of a merger between Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, orchestrated by their respective leaders to fend off potential takeovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. However, internal strife between the co-founders Henry Racamier and Alain Chevalier provided an opening for Arnault. Through strategic maneuvers, he bought shares taking advantage of market conditions following the 1987 stock market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. By 1989, Arnault had outmaneuvered both leaders to become the chairman and asserted his vision for the future of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

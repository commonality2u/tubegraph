## The Genesis of Dell

Michael Dell's fascination with computers began early. As a teenager, he was captivated by business magazines, computer parts, and the inner workings of devices like the Apple II, which he bought with his savings at the age of 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This early interest laid the groundwork for his later business endeavors. Dell's path to founding his company was marked by an insatiable curiosity and a series of small entrepreneurial ventures, such as selling newspaper subscriptions using data-driven insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Founding Dell Computer Corporation

In 1984, while still a freshman, Dell founded PCs Limited, which would later become Dell Computer Corporation. Working in his dorm room, he began upgrading and customizing PCs, realizing he could offer better configurations at lower prices by eliminating the middleman and selling directly to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This direct-to-consumer model was a pivotal innovation that contributed to Dell's early success.

Dell's first big break came with the creation of the "Michael Dell special," a fully customized computer built according to customer specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This approach not only appealed to individual consumers but also attracted significant business clients, leading to rapid growth and an impressive revenue stream.

## Scaling and Innovation

By 1987, Dell's company was generating $6 million in sales, a figure that would skyrocket to $33 million within the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. The company continued to innovate, not just in product offerings but also in marketing and operations. Dell leveraged advertising to great effect, with strategic campaigns that highlighted the brand's advantages over competitors like [[compact | Compact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

Throughout the 1990s, Dell successfully navigated challenges such as market downturns by leveraging their efficient business model and continuing to grow their market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. Dell's responsiveness to technological changes was evident in their early adoption of internet sales, launching dell.com at a time when there were only a few thousand websites worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

## Going Private and Further Expansion

In 2013, Michael Dell made the audacious decision to take Dell private in a bold $24.4 billion buyout, allowing the company to transform away from the pressures of quarterly earnings reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. Just two years later, Dell orchestrated the largest ever technology acquisition by purchasing EMC for $67 billion, further cementing Dell's position in IT infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>.

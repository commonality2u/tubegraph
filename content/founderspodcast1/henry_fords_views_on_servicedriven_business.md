Henry Ford, one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history, held a distinct philosophy regarding the core purpose of business, which centered around service to others. His views on service-driven business are deeply embedded within his autobiography, *My Life and Work*, and provide valuable insights for contemporary entrepreneurs.

## The Essence of Service

Ford believed that the primary purpose of business was to serve others, not merely to make a profit. He emphasized that true business success stems from the ability to provide high-quality products at low prices to benefit the consumer. This principle is summed up in his oft-repeated maxim:

## Ford's Business Philosophy

### Continuous Improvement and Efficiency

Central to Ford's views was the idea of continuous improvement and the elimination of waste. He argued that businesses should always aim to improve operations to serve customers better. Ford's dedication to refining processes and the manufacturing system was best illustrated by his development of the assembly line, which significantly cut production time and costs.

### Opposition to Traditional Business Norms

Ford was critical of the prevailing business norms of his time, particularly the focus on profits over service. He believed that many businesses were managed with an emphasis on finance rather than on enhancing service, which he felt was detrimental to true progress:

### Commitment to High Wages

Ford was pioneering in his approach to employee relations, famously instituting the $5 workday to ensure his workers could afford the products they made. He viewed wages not as mere numbers but as crucial to the well-being of families and society:

> "On a cost sheet, wages are figures; out in the world wages are bread boxes and coal bins, babies' nose wiped and children's education, family comforts and contentment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>

## Application Beyond Automobile Manufacturing

Ford argued that his principles of service-driven business could be applied universally across industries. This belief was demonstrated when he bought a failing railroad and applied his business philosophy to turn it into a profitable enterprise. By reducing waste and focusing on service, Ford showed that focusing on serving customers could rejuvenate any business:

> "The essence of my idea then is that waste and greed block the delivery of true service." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>

## Legacy and Influence

Ford's views on service remain highly relevant today, influencing contemporary business strategies focused on customer satisfaction and continuous improvement. His legacy includes demonstrating how putting service over profit not only benefits consumers but can also yield substantial financial success in the long term.

By steering his company with an unwavering commitment to service, Henry Ford transformed the automotive industry and set a standard for future generations of entrepreneurs. His life's work underscores the enduring power of a service-driven business model as a pathway to sustainable success.

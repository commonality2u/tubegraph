[[Sam Zells approach to risk and investment | Sam Zell]], a prominent figure in real estate and entrepreneurship, credits part of his success to a unique strategy known as the "Hawaiian technique." This innovative approach was inspired by another real estate mogul, [William Zeckendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zeckendorf), and it significantly influenced Zell's methodology in the industry.

## Origins of the Hawaiian Technique

The Hawaiian technique is detailed in Zeckendorf's autobiography, a book that deeply resonated with [[Sam Zells entrepreneurial philosophy | Sam Zell]] when he read it as a young man. Zeckendorf's strategy involved viewing assets as a sum of their parts to enhance the overall value of a property. Instead of perceiving a property as a single entity, Zeckendorf broke it down into various components, including its ground leasehold, fee position, operating leasehold, and residual position. This allowed him to seek out different investors for each part, maximizing the property's total value by handling each component separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.

## Application in Zell's Investments

[[Lessons from Sam Zell on entrepreneurship and curiosity | Sam Zell]] described this technique as brilliant and adopted it both within and outside the real estate industry. He found that assessing a property in terms of its individual components allowed for an increase in the overall value, akin to making one plus one equal three. An example highlighted by Zell involved One Park Avenue in Manhattan, which was traditionally valued at $10 million but reached a $15 million valuation through the application of Zeckendorf's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

## Strategic Benefits

The strategic advantage of the Hawaiian technique lies in its flexibility and its applicability to various assets and investment types. According to [[sam_zells_entrepreneurial_philosophy | Zell]], by diversifying the investor base and approaching different aspects of a property with tailored strategies, he could capitalize on the unique values of each segment, thereby increasing the property's total worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from the Hawaiian technique exemplify [[lessons_from_sam_zells_career_and_partnerships | lessons from Sam Zells career]] emphasizing the importance of innovation, adaptability, and strategic thinking in real estate investments. Zell's application of Zeckendorf's method not only illustrates the timelessness of certain investment strategies but also highlights the potential to transform conventional assets into significantly more valuable opportunities. The Hawaiian technique remains a cornerstone of Zell's illustrious career, illustrating the profound impact of historical insights on modern investment practices.

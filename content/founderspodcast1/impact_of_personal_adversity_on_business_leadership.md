The journey of an individual through personal adversity can significantly shape their approach to leadership and business. This is exemplified in the life of Les Schwab, a renowned businessman who founded a tire company that grew into a multi-billion dollar business. Through Schwab's autobiography "Les Schwab, Pride in Performance: Keep It Going," we can explore the profound impact personal challenges had on his development as a business leader.

## Les Schwab's Early Life and Adversity

Les Schwab's formative years were marked by significant personal challenges, beginning with a troubled family environment. Schwab was born in 1917, during a time of economic hardship that was further compounded by his father's alcoholism. His schooling began in a humble railroad box car, and his family was hit hard by the Great Depression, losing their farm to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

These early experiences taught Schwab resilience and a strong work ethic from a young age.

## The Hardship of Personal Loss

Perhaps one of the more poignant adversities Schwab faced was the loss of both his parents by the age of 16.

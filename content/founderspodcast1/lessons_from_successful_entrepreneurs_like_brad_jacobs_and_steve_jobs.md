## The Importance of Recruiting Talented People

Both Brad Jacobs and Steve Jobs emphasize the crucial role of surrounding oneself with the smartest and most talented individuals. Jacobs, who has started multiple billion-dollar ventures, believes that the most important thing a CEO does is to recruit exceptional people. He highlights that there is no substitute for intelligence and advises hiring choices to be as perfect as possible, noting that "an empty seat is less damaging than a poor fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Steve Jobs shared a similar sentiment, stating, "I think I've consistently figured out who the really smart people were to hang around with. You must find extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>. Jobs continued to say that in the field of interest, the dynamic range between what an average person and the best person could accomplish was often dramatically wide, advising entrepreneurs to go after the cream of the crop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Mindset

Successful entrepreneurship also requires a strong mindset and a willingness to continuously learn. Jacobs stresses the importance of going to school on everybody, learning from every interaction and experience. This constant quest for knowledge is something that both Jacobs and successful figures like Jeff Bezos have in common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Clarity of Thought and Communication

In business, clarity of thought and communication can propel an organization forward.

A commitment to clear thinking not only helps in decision making but also ensures a unified direction for the organization.

## Embracing and Solving Problems

Both Jacobs and Jobs recognize that problems are inherent to business and should be viewed as opportunities for growth. Jacobs learned from his mentor that business is about finding and embracing problems, as each is an obstacle to remove on the path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This aligns with Steve Jobs' approach of persistently driving towards solutions and improvements.

## Investing in Technology and Innovation

Technology is a dominant mega-trend, and investing heavily in tech is crucial for success in almost any industry. Jacobs has always prioritized tech investments, aligning with Peter Thiel's notion that understanding and leveraging technology can lead to breakthrough innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Paying It Forward

Successful entrepreneurs often focus on helping the next generation.

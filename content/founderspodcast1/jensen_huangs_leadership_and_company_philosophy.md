## Introduction

Jensen Huang, the founder of [[jensen_huangs_work_ethic_and_management_style | Nvidia]], has developed a unique leadership and company philosophy that has been instrumental in shaping the organization into a tech giant over the last three decades. Jensen is known for his relentless focus on technical skill, maximum effort, and building a company culture that mirrors his own image.

## Key Leadership Traits

### Prioritizing Technical Skill and Talent

Jensen's approach to leadership is reminiscent of [[comparison_between_jensen_huang_steve_jobs_and_jeff_bezos | iconic leaders like Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos]]. He prioritizes technical skill and talent above all else, emphasizing the need to hire and surround oneself with the best and brightest individuals. This philosophy is akin to Steve Jobs' insistence on building a team of A+ players who can outperform larger teams of mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Public Criticism and Teaching

Huang employs a method of public criticism to address mistakes and promote learning within Nvidia. This approach to feedback is similar to [[steve_jobs_approach_to_management_and_leadership | Steve Jobs' method]] of directness and bluntness, where the quality of work is held above personal feelings. Jensen believes public feedback serves as a learning opportunity for the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

Moreover, Jensen is regarded as a teacher within Nvidia, often being referred to as "Professor Jensen." Much like other great founders, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to teaching and developing the people within his organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

## Company Philosophy

### Flat Organizational Structure

Jensen has structured Nvidia with a flat organization of 60 direct reports. This model accelerates decision-making and ensures everyone from top to bottom is empowered and informed, reducing bureaucracy and enhancing agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

### Continuous Innovation and Perseverance

A core element of Nvidia’s philosophy is that innovation is a necessity, not an option. Driven by a firm belief in continuous improvement and perseverance through failure, Jensen has positioned Nvidia to adapt and thrive over the years. This mindset is evident in Nvidia's ability to pivot and focus on AI at a time when others were cautious, a move that has reaped massive rewards for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>.

### Speed of Light Objective

Jensen sets incredibly ambitious goals, referenced as reaching the "speed of light," to motivate his team to work at the maximum possible efficiency constrained only by the laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### Establishing a Learning Organization

Jensen goes to "school on everybody," continuously seeking to learn from others and integrate those lessons into Nvidia. Whether it's through attending industry conferences or reading extensively, Jensen’s lifelong learning philosophy drives the company towards excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.

## Relentless Work Ethic

Kobe's commitment was apparent from the outset of his career. Upon being drafted, instead of celebrating like most players, Kobe went straight to the gym to continue working on his craft.

## Learning from the Greats

One of Bryant's most profound influences was Michael Jordan. Kobe reached out to Jordan for advice on various aspects of the game, demonstrating his desire to absorb knowledge from the greats. This wasn't just about emulating Jordan; Kobe sought to become even better by refining his unique style through the insights of others. The relationship between Kobe and Michael was akin to a mentorship, where Jordan would freely offer guidance, solidifying Kobe's learning-driven mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

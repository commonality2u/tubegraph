## Initial Success and the Challenges of Growing

## Cofounder Conflicts

One of the more personal challenges Mackey faced was related to conflicts with cofounders. Having initiated the business with a romantic partner, he faced unusual and complex dynamics. For instance, urging for an open relationship led to personal heartbreak when Renee acted on it, and Mackey realized the emotional complexity of such decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Additionally, philosophical and strategic differences with cofounder Mark manifested as Mackey's ambitions to grow clashed with differing visions for the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

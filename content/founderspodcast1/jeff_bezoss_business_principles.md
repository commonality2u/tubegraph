## Key Tenets of Bezos's Business Philosophy

### Long-Term Orientation

From the outset, Bezos was adamant about building a long-lasting business, not a generic commodity firm. He consistently emphasized the primacy of long-term shareholder value over short-term profits. In his first shareholder letter in 1997, Bezos stated:
"We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long-term. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>.

### Obsession Over Customers

A relentless focus on customer experience has been a cornerstone of Amazon's strategy. Bezos envisioned Amazon as "Earth's most customer-centric company," a mission that involves obsessing over improving the customer experience. This ideology is embedded deeply in Amazon’s operations and is reflected in the 1998 letter: 
"We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

### Relentless Innovation

A key trait of Amazon under Bezos has been its culture of continuous innovation, often driven by a willingness to experiment boldly and accept failures. Bezos advocates for major innovation, saying:
"Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high. Speed matters in business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. 

### High Standards and Patience

Bezos believes that high standards can be contagious and are crucial for success. Moreover, he maintains that endurance and patience yield long-term success, advising:
"If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.

### Long-Term Customer Focus

The commitment to continuously return efficiency improvements to customers in the form of lower prices is another principle. Bezos underlined this approach in his letters:
"Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

### Encouraging Wandering and Mistakes

Bezos treasures the wandering which leads to unfound opportunities, a notion he articulates as:
"Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. 

### Building Enduring Companies

In line with [[Sam Zells entrepreneurial philosophy | Sam Zell's entrepreneurial philosophy]] and the philosophies of other noteworthy business leaders like [[Akio Moritas business philosophy | Akio Morita]] and [[Principles of Successful Entrepreneurship]], Bezos sought to create a company that could outlive him, serving as a lasting legacy.

## Conclusion

Bezos's business principles have not only shaped Amazon into what it is today but also serve as prescient guides for any entrepreneur. His shareholder letters are a treasure trove of strategic wisdom, emphasizing the importance of long-term thinking, customer obsession, and innovative spirit. As Bezos concludes in his letters:
"Differentiation is survival, and the universe wants you to be typical. Do not let it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

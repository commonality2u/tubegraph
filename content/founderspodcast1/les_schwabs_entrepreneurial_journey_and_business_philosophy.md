## Early Life and Determination

Les Schwab was born on October 3, 1917. Early in life, Schwab dealt with a family troubled by his father's alcoholism and the economic turbulence of the Great Depression. These experiences ingrained in him a deep sense of personal pride and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Despite challenges, he was proud and determined not to repeat his father's failures. His early career began with delivering newspapers, where he quickly exhibited his predisposition for business by taking over all delivery routes in his town at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Building a Tire Empire

Moving from the newspaper business to the tire industry was a pivotal shift for Schwab. At the age of 33, Schwab purchased his first tire shop in 1952 by borrowing against his life insurance, selling his house, and taking loans from his brother-in-law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The tire industry was notoriously competitive and dominated by larger companies that also controlled supply chains. Schwab's success in the tire business didn't come from experience in tires but from leveraging his sales skills and understanding how to run a business effectively.

## Philosophy and Incentives

A cornerstone of Schwab's success was his unique approach to incentivizing employees. He believed in sharing profits with those working hard within the store, particularly because he couldn't be onsite at every location all the time. By making managers direct stakeholders, he ensured that they were motivated to perform to the best of their abilities, treating the stores as their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Charlie Munger of [[charlie_mungers_analysis_of_les_schwabs_business_principles | Berkshire Hathaway]] lauded Schwabâ€™s business model, emphasizing the importance of incentives in aligning employee interests with company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.

## Overcoming Industry Challenges

Early in his career, Schwab faced challenges due to unfair practices by large rubber companies that favored their own retail operations, giving them preferential pricing which put independent dealers at a disadvantage. Schwab identified these challenges as opportunities, partnering with international firms like Toyo Tire Company from Japan, thus breaking the monopoly and reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Marketing Innovation

Les Schwab was not just a savvy businessman but also a marketing innovator. He pioneered the concept of a "tire supermarket," where he showcased all available tires prominently in the store rather than hiding them in warehouses. This strategy not only served as a practical marketing ploy but also as a visual testament to the store's vast inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

Walmart is one of the most extraordinary retail success stories, founded and nurtured under the leadership of [Sam Walton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton). This article delves into how Walmart was created, the principles that guided its expansion, and the significant milestones in its history.

## Early Life and Influences

Sam Walton's background had a profound influence on his business ethos. Growing up during the Great Depression, Sam Walton developed a fierce work ethic inspired by his father, whose life motto was "work, work, work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This relentless drive for hard work and determination played a crucial role in his later success.

## Founding of the First Store

The initial step in Sam Walton's retail journey was purchasing a Ben Franklin five-and-dime franchise in Newport, Arkansas. Funded by a $25,000 loan from his father-in-law, Walton's first store opened at the age of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Walton experimented with customer-centric tactics, such as adding an ice cream machine to attract shoppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## The Loss in Newport and New Beginnings

Despite building a successful business, Walton lost the Newport store due to a lease agreement oversight. This setback forced him to start anew, leading him to Bentonville, Arkansas. A lesson learned from Newport was the importance of controlling his real estate, prompting him to secure a 99-year lease for his new store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Innovations in Retailing

Walmart's core strategy was driven by a commitment to keep costs low and pass those savings on to customers. This focus on discounting emerged from Walton's admiration of other successful retailers like JC Penney and later, the innovative discounter Kmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. 

## The Birth of Walmart

Walton brought his vision for Walmart to life in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. The first Walmart had an immediate impact, achieving significant sales growth from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. The name "Walmart" was chosen for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, requiring fewer letters for signage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## Scaling and Innovations

### Operational Efficiency

Walmart's competitive edge was bolstered by innovative systems for inventory management and logistics. Investing $500 million in a revolutionary IBM mainframe setup in 1979, Walmart interconnected its stores, warehouses, and distribution centers, streamlining operations and reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.

### Accelerated Growth and Acquisition Strategy

Walton saw the potential for rapid expansion, not just through internal growth but also through strategic acquisitions. As a public company, Walmart quickly absorbed other retail chains, converting them to Walmart stores and accelerating its growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

### Innovations in Wholesale and Membership Clubs

In 1983, shortly after visiting a Price Club to witness the nascent membership wholesale model, Sam Walton launched Sam’s Club. Within months, Sam's Club was operational, leading to a chain of successful wholesale clubs that significantly boosted Walmart’s revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

## Customer-Centric Philosophy

Walmart's success was deeply rooted in its commitment to customer satisfaction, encapsulated by Walton’s adage that "the customer is always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. This philosophy manifested in practices such as ensuring easy returns and providing an unmatched customer service experience.

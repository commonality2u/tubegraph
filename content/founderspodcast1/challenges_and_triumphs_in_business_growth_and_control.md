## The Genesis of an Idea

It all began in 1979 when Dyson conceived the idea of an improved vacuum cleaner. His concept of a Cyclone-based vacuum system came from observing the inadequacies of existing models. He noted, "If there was a better kind of vacuum cleaner, Hoover would have invented it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This epiphany spurred his relentless pursuit to transform this idea into reality.

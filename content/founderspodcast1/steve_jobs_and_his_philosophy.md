## A Window into Steve's Thinking

> [!info]
> The best way to understand a person is to listen to that person directly. Steve's words in speeches, interviews, and emails offer a window into how he thought. He was an exquisite thinker much of what is in these pages reflects guiding themes of Steve's life: his sense of worlds that would emerge from marrying the arts and technology, his unbelievable rigor, and his insights into what it meant to be human.

### Insights Born of True Inner Freedom

Jobs was known for his ability to envision what could and should exist, rather than accepting reality as it was. His ideas were intuitions born of a true inner freedom and an epic sense of possibility. He encouraged the belief that life was created by people no smarter or more capable than we are, and thus, it could be changed for the better. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

## Philosophy of Work and Life

Steve Jobs believed that the most important thing was to do work one loved. He famously stated that:

> The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>

He encouraged people to follow their hearts and intuition, asserting they somehow already know what one truly wants to become. Everything else, he believed, was secondary. 

## Life as a Rainbow

A striking metaphor used by Jobs was to think of life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon of the world:

> You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, and then you disappear. (Steve Jobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>

This poetic view highlights his philosophy of making the most of one's time and leaving a lasting impact.

## The Integration of Arts and Technology

Jobs learned early on from [[edwin_land | Edwin Land]] the importance of uniting the arts and technology. This philosophy informed the creation of products that were not only functional but also artistically beautiful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

## Tenacity and Focus

His tenure at Apple was marked by a rigorous focus on quality and innovation. Jobs famously slashed Appleâ€™s product lines from dozens to just four, emphasizing the importance of focusing on a few excellent products rather than spreading resources thinly across many. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>

## Facing Mortality

Throughout his speeches and writings, Jobs spoke candidly about mortality:

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool. I've encountered to help me make the big choices in life. (Steve Jobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>

Knowing that life is temporary encouraged him to live boldly and make decisions based on passion rather than fear or societal expectations.

## Conclusion

Steve Jobs' philosophy is a testament to the power of vision, focus, and the ceaseless pursuit of excellence. His life and work continue to inspire countless individuals to think differently, innovate, and create wondrous things for the world.

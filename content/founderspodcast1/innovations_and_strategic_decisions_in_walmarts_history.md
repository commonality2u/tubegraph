Walmart, founded by [[sam_waltons_early_life_and_career|Sam Walton]], has become a cornerstone of retail by implementing a series of innovative strategies and decisions. These innovations have contributed significantly to the growth of the corporation, establishing Walmart as a dominant force in the retail industry.

## Early Innovations and Business Strategy

Walmart's strategic foundation is built on a simple, yet powerful business model articulated by Sam Walton himself: "It's a very simple idea. I'm going to buy cheap, I'm going to sell low, I'm going to do that every day, and I'm going to do it with a smile and focus on service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Location Strategy

From its inception, Walmart expanded by strategically opening stores in small towns, avoiding big cities, similar to the strategy used by JC Penney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This allowed Walmart to tap into markets that were overlooked by other large retailers, resulting in substantial growth.

### Incentive Structure

Following his early exposure to JC Penney's business model, Walton implemented a 25% profit-sharing incentive for store managers at Walmart. This strategy was inspired by his manager at JC Penney, who motivated his team with profit-sharing bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Technological Innovations

Walmart has been at the forefront of adopting technology to improve its operations.

### Investment in Computer Systems

In 1979, despite initial skepticism about the cost, Walmart invested $500 million in a modern communications computer system, including massive IBM mainframes. This investment enabled real-time communication between all stores, warehouses, and the headquarters, dramatically increasing efficiency and data-driven decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

### Supply Chain Efficiency

Walmart's use of technology extended to its supply chain, where real-time data helped manage inventory and reduce costs. This focus on efficiency was learned early on, echoing the lesson from JC Penney that emphasized cost vigilance and efficient operations as key to business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Expansion and Growth Strategy

### Rapid Expansion

Sam Walton's relentless drive for innovation led to rapid expansion. After realizing the potential of discounting, he transitioned from variety stores to discount stores like Walmart, aggressively expanding across small towns in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

### Acquisition Strategy

To accelerate growth, Walmart began acquiring other retail chains and converting them into Walmart stores. This approach, coupled with an IPO in the early years, provided the necessary resources for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

## Learning and Adaptation

Walmart's success can also be attributed to its culture of continuous learning and adaptation. Sam Walton was known for his management by walking around philosophy, which entailed gathering ideas and suggestions directly from front-line employees and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

### Influence of Competitors

Walton famously learned from other retailers, such as Kmart and Sol Priceâ€™s Price Club, adopting and improving on their strategies to better suit Walmart's needs [[business_philosophy_and_innovation_at_ikea | (like IKEA's adaptation in different markets)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

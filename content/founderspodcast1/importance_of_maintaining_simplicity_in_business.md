> Todd Graves founded Raising Cane's, a successful quick-service restaurant that specializes in chicken fingers. Graves owns over 90% of the business, valued at least at $10 billion.

## A Singular Focus: One Love

Todd Graves attributes much of his success to honing in on a singular focus—creating the best chicken finger meals possible. Graves has consistently resisted the urge to diversify his menu beyond this singular offering. He believes that concentrating on one thing and doing it exceptionally well leads to loyal customers and repeated success. Graves states, "If you do what you do well and consistently do it great, your customers will come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Efficiency Through Simplicity

Graves's deeply rooted belief in simplicity isn't just about the menu; it's about the entire business operation. By keeping things simple, such as having a limited menu, Raising Cane's maximizes efficiency in service and food quality. Graves notes, "If I added different things, my quality would go down, my speed would go down, and it wouldn't be our concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

In a system where each detail is connected, simplicity ensures that every aspect of the business aligns smoothly with the overall mission—delivering high-quality meals quickly.

## Lessons from Other Founders

The importance of simplicity in business is a common theme among successful founders. Graves's approach is reminiscent of other legendary entrepreneurs, such as [[building_and_maintaining_a_strong_business_ethos_and_culture | Harry Snyder]] of In-N-Out Burger, who maintained a limited, high-quality menu since its founding in 1948. This similarity highlights that businesses flourishing through the decades often share a commitment to simplicity and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Simplicity as a Competitive Advantage

By maintaining simplicity, Graves has positioned Raising Cane's to thrive where others might flounder amidst complexity. Graves's focus on a singular product and sound business ethos allows his company to compete effectively against non-founder-led chains that may lack a personal touch or commitment.

## Joseph Duveen and American Millionaires

Joseph Duveen observed that while Europe was rich in art, America was rich in wealth. This simple observation became the cornerstone of his career, starting in 1886 when he was just 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Duveen's model involved sourcing art from European markets and selling it to wealthy American clients. His clients included some of the most affluent and influential figures of the Gilded Age, such as JP Morgan, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Mellon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Duveen's Strategies in the Art Market

Duveen would journey between Europe and America, providing affluent Americans access to European nobility's country homes filled with ancestral portraits for sale.

## The Role of Exclusivity and Scarcity

A fundamental element of Duveen's strategy was creating an atmosphere of exclusivity and scarcity which elevated the value of the art pieces he sold. He insisted on controlling the supply, ensuring that the artworks he dealt with were seen as rare and prestigious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This reflected his belief that art, being priceless, should command high prices.

## Building American Collections

Duveen played a pivotal role in establishing significant American art collections, often by orchestrating visits for his clients to view his works in the homes of other collectors. One notable client was Andrew Mellon, who, with Duveen's influence, amassed a collection which later became foundational to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Joseph Duveen's career exemplifies the synergy between European art and American wealth during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His strategies in dealing, his attention to human psychology, and the relationships he fostered significantly influenced how art was collected and valued in America, leaving a lasting legacy on the art market both historically and contemporarily.

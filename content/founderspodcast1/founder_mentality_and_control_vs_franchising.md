Founders often grapple with the decision of whether to maintain control over their business by owning and operating each location or to expand more quickly by franchising. This discussion frequently revolves around two primary options: maintaining a founder-led business that emphasizes personal involvement and control, or adopting a franchise model which often leads to faster growth but less centralized control.

## Todd Graves and Raising Cane's

Todd Graves, founder of Raising Cane's, exemplifies the founder mentality focused on maintaining control. Graves owns over 90% of his business, which is valued at billions of dollars, and has continually turned down numerous offers to buy or franchise his profitable venture. His dedication to maintaining the quality and vision of his brand is paramount, and he equates losing control with losing the essence of what makes Raising Cane's special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Risks of Franchising

> Pursuing a franchise model can dilute the founder's vision and control. Graves notes that franchises result in a loss of quality control, as management decisions become financial rather than personal. This loss of personal investment can lead to a lack of genuine care for the brand and its stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

Graves argues that a franchise model often prioritizes financial decisions over personal ones. He highlights that big corporate entities lose personal touch, as decisions tend to be driven by financial imperatives rather than the founder's passion and mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

## Advantages of Maintaining Control

The Raising Cane's approach showcases several benefits to retaining company ownership. Graves believes in doing one thing exceptionally well and maintaining a laser-like focus on the quality of his product. He emphasizes that keeping business operations under personal oversight ensures superior product quality and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

Furthermore, this approach aligns with the views of other successful entrepreneurs, such as [[sam_zells_entrepreneurial_philosophy | Sam Zell]], who prioritize maintaining control in their operations to ensure their vision is executed to perfection.

## Singular Vision and Focus

Graves recounts his belief in maintaining a simple menu and focusing on chickens fingers as an example of staying true to a singular vision. He echoes the sentiment that every detail matters, fostering a profound connection between the work and the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

Graves' dedication to a hands-on approach and involvement in decisions, even regarding minor operations like menu choices and marketing strategies, guards against losing the personal connection to the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

## Lessons for Entrepreneurs

Graves' journey emphasizes the significance of being a "fanatical" founder. Staying deeply involved in the business and not giving up are crucial aspects that contribute to long-term success. His approach involves embracing every element of the business, ensuring that each decision aligns with the overarching vision, thereby creating a competitive edge against non-founder-led corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

In conclusion, Graves' story reinforces the importance of the [[importance_of_mindset_and_attitude_in_entrepreneurship | mindset and attitude in entrepreneurship]] that places high value on maintaining personal involvement and control. This founder mentality contrasts sharply with the potential dilution seen in franchise models, emphasizing a more personal, controlled growth path that aligns directly with the founder's original vision and commitment.

Ambition is a driving force in the journey of many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders. It acts as a catalyst for pursuing goals and overcoming obstacles. This article delves into the facets of ambition, its impact on success, and how it intertwines with other traits like determination and discipline.

## Understanding Ambition

Ambition is essentially the desire and determination to achieve success. It helps define one's goals and propels individuals towards their aspirations. According to Paul Graham, ambition is not only a component of determination but also crucial in choosing one's destination in life. It is malleable, meaning it can be cultivated and increased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

## The Interplay of Ambition and Determination

Determination, a mix of willfulness and discipline, is often highlighted as a larger predictor of success than innate talent or intelligence. Ambitious individuals leverage their determination by consistently pushing forward despite challenges. After all, having a strong will without discipline is insufficient if one gives in to base impulses. This balance between will and discipline ensures that ambition translates into tangible success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## External Influences and Ambition Growth

Ambitious individuals are rare, but they flourish when connected with similarly driven peers. This environment acts like water to a plant, allowing them to "bloom like dying plants given water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. The company one keeps significantly affects ambition, as ambitious peers provide encouragement and inspiration lacking in a more conventional setting.

## Encouragement from Achievements

Achievements themselves can further fuel ambition. As individuals reach milestones and achieve their goals, their sights often set higher. Success breeds more ambition, driving individuals to aim for even greater accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

As seen in entrepreneurial journeys across history, ambition helps individuals set high standards and aligns with traits like determination and discipline to create impactful results in business and beyond.

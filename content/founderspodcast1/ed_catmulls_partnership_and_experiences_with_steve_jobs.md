This partnership spanned over 26 years and was pivotal in shaping Pixar into the company it is today.

## The Genesis of a Partnership

In 1979, fresh off the success of "Star Wars", George Lucas hired Ed Catmull to integrate high technology into the film industry. This role placed Catmull at a unique vantage point, observing the rapid emergence and failings of many Silicon Valley startups. By the mid-1980s, Pixar was in need of a benefactor to continue its groundbreaking work in computer animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Steve Jobs entered the scene in 1985, expressing interest in purchasing Pixar from Lucasfilm. At first, Ed was uneasy about Jobs' intense personality. However, after several interactions, it became clear that Jobs was committed to producing "insanely great products", a vision that resonated with Pixar's own aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

## The Roller Coaster Ride with Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs' acquisition of Pixar for $5 million was the start of a long, illustrious journey. Jobs saw potential in Pixar that many others had overlooked, and he was willing to invest heavily, both financially and emotionally, into the company. Jobs was known for his demanding nature, but Catmull observed significant changes in him over time, noting his ability to listen more and express empathy in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

## Creative Tensions and Mutual Growth

One interesting dynamic of their partnership was how Steve valued passion and expertise. Although he could be direct, those working with him, like filmmaker Bill Kon, learned that standing up for one's creative vision was not only respected by Jobs but often led him to change his stance if he recognized the merit in other viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

Ed Catmull highlights that upon meeting Jobs, many had to adjust to his style. Jobsâ€™ feedback, while sometimes harsh, was driven by a desire for excellence and was ultimately aimed at making Pixar's works as exceptional as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

Catmull credits much of Pixar's success to the passionate pursuit of excellence shared by him, [[the_evolution_of_steve_jobss_leadership | Steve Jobs]], and John Lasseter. This pursuit was not merely about creating a successful business but about making a lasting impact through their work. Jobs often remarked on the enduring nature of movies compared to the ephemeral existence of consumer electronics, emphasizing the lasting legacy Pixar's films would have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

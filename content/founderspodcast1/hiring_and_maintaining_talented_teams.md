In the landscape of business, the art of [[the_importance_of_recruiting_and_managing_talent | hiring and retaining talent]] represents a critical determinant of success. Brad Jacobs, an experienced entrepreneur, emphasizes that the most significant responsibility of a CEO is to hire exceptional people. His learnings echo the sentiment that hiring decisions must be as flawless as possible, as the repercussions of hiring the wrong person can be extraordinarily costly. An empty seat, in his view, is less detrimental than a poor fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36">[46:36]</a>.

## The Dynamic Range of Human Capability

Jacobs draws a parallel to the ideas of [[steve_jobs_approach_to_management_and_leadership | Steve Jobs]], who noted that in many fields, the difference in performance between average and top performers could be as vast as 100:1. This stark contrast underlines the significance of hiring A+ players. Jobs articulated that a small team of A players can outperform a large group of B and C players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17">[48:17]</a>.

## Evaluating Potential Hires

When evaluating potential hires, Jacobs prioritizes two primary criteria:
1. **Superior Intelligence**: There is no substitute for smart individuals, as intelligence is closely tied to organizational success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:54">[48:54]</a>.
2. **Dialectical Thinking**: The capacity to view issues from multiple perspectives and reconcile seemingly contradictory information is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:39">[49:39]</a>.

Jacobs also values flexibility in thought and cautions against rigid thinkers.

## Overpaying for A Players

Brad Jacobs advises that companies should be prepared to overpay for top talent because it is nearly impossible to overpay for true talent. He emphasizes that talent should be compensated well, as financial incentives do play a motivational role in employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01">[52:01]</a>.

> The key takeaway is that the cost of hiring a second-best candidate can far exceed the salary savings, ultimately impacting the company’s profitability.

## Building an Outrageously Talented Team

Jacobs believes in the love vibe, where a company environment is like a party, and only those who raise the vibe are invited. This philosophy extends to maintaining a workplace culture where the team spends a lot of time together and enjoys one another's company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21">[50:21]</a>.

## Differentiating Between A, B, and C Players

To distinguish between the different types of employees, Jacobs employs a mental simulation where he imagines an employee quitting unexpectedly. His visceral response acts as a gauge of the employee’s value:
- **C Players**: If relieved by an imagined resignation.
- **B Players**: If amenable to replacement yet not essential.
- **A Players**: If the thought of losing them induces panic.

He stresses that B players often hire C players, so the goal is to minimize C players and keep the team filled with high-performing individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29">[51:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

Overall, hiring and maintaining talented teams is pivotal to creating substantial value in any business. As Jacobs and other entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs have shown, a focus on intelligence, creativity, and culture is crucial in assembling teams that do not just participate but thrive and propel the organization towards outsized returns and success.

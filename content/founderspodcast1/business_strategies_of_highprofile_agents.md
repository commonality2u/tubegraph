High-profile agents possess distinct strategies that set them apart in the competitive world of entertainment. These strategies often stem from a deep understanding of both the industry dynamics and human psychology. The careers of individuals such as Michael Ovitz provide a rich tapestry of lessons on how to build and sustain power in such environments.

## The Importance of Cost Control

One major theme emphasized by historical entrepreneurs and echoed by people like Andrew Carnegie is the importance of controlling expenses. Ovitz, in his approach, demonstrated how critical it is not just to control costs during challenging times but also during boom periods, as indicated by the podcast conversation with John Mackey from Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

> "Profits and prices were cyclical, subject to any number of transient forces of the marketplace. Costs, however, could be strictly controlled and any savings achieved in the costs were permanent." — Andrew Carnegie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

## Broadening the Scope

### Building Equity and Expanding Revenue Models

Agents like Ovitz didn't limit themselves to traditional talent representation. They consistently looked to expand revenue opportunities, moving from mere agent work to consulting for corporate mergers and acquisitions. Ovitz, for instance, helped negotiate the sale of MCA Universal to Panasonic for $6.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

### Innovative Packaging of Talent

One key strategy was to create entire packages (actors, directors, scripts) that Ovitz and his agency could offer to studios, rather than waiting for opportunities to come their way. This allowed Ovitz to leverage his agency’s influence over the studios significantly, a practice unheard of in movies before his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.

## Relationship Management

### Handling Co-founder Conflict

Ovitz's experiences with his co-founder Ron Meyer's betrayal underscore the importance of managing relationships and expectations. The conflict arose despite years of partnership, reminding us of the complexities in shared ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

> Despite betrayals and conflicts, Ovitz remained surprisingly trusting of others, understanding that out of thousands, only a few might betray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

### Cultivating Influence and Loyalty

Ovitz was known for caring deeply about maintaining and cultivating strong relationships, often preferring verbal agreements over written contracts. He believed that contracts could be counterproductive and was cautious about their renewal anniversaries sparking thoughts of leaving among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

## Continuous Self-Improvement

A hallmark of high-profile agents like Ovitz is their unyielding pursuit of knowledge. Ovitz spent years watching every Oscar-winning film and read extensively about industry leaders like Kanosuki Matsushita of Panasonic, always preparing diligently before major negotiations or strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

In summary, the strategies of high-profile agents encompass a wide range of practices from financial prudence and innovative business approaches to relationship management and continuous learning. These methods not only ensure success in their own ventures but also leave a substantial impact on the industries they operate within.

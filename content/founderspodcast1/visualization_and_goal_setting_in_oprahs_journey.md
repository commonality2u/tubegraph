## Visualization in Action

Oprah's belief in the power of visualization is evident in her personal reflections and speeches:

- **The Color Purple**: One of the most remarkable examples of visualization in Oprah's life was her involvement in the film "The Color Purple." Before she was cast, Oprah was deeply moved by the book and intensely desired to be part of the project. Despite not having acted before, she envisioned herself in the movie, telling herself, “I wanted it more than anything in the world” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23">[12:23]</a>.

- **Quincy Jones' Discovery**: Oprah's visualization was part of a larger pattern where she anticipated opportunities before they materialized. Before working with Quincy Jones, who would ultimately help cast her in "The Color Purple," she felt she would be discovered because she “wanted it so badly” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17">[11:17]</a>.

## Goals and Self-Belief

Oprah's journey highlights how goals and self-belief are intertwined with visualization:

- **Childhood Aspirations**: Even as a child, Oprah had a strong sense of self-belief and a future that was different from her present. Growing up in challenging circumstances, she stated, “I knew somehow that my life would be different and it would be better” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28">[18:28]</a>.

- **Ownership and Independence**: When moving towards owning her own show, Oprah transitioned from accepting what was given to actively creating and shaping her path.

### Childhood and Golf Introduction

Tiger Woods' golfing journey began before he was even a year old. His father, Earl Woods, a retired U.S. Army officer, was obsessed with the game and decided early on to introduce Tiger to golf. By the age of one, Tiger had already spent 100 to 200 hours watching his father practice golf swings in their garage. Earl would place Tiger in a high chair and swing clubs into a net, a routine that would mesmerize young Tiger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

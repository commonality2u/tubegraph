Thomas Edison, one of history's most prolific inventors, is renowned not only for his groundbreaking inventions but also for his distinctive work ethic and management style. His approach to work and leadership significantly shaped his success and left a lasting legacy in the realms of invention and innovation.

## Edison's Approach to Work

Edison's commitment to his work was nothing short of legendary. His dedication to innovation was fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the world and his desire to make it a better place. Edison's work ethic was characterized by long, grueling hours, and he often worked through the night, seemingly needing little sleep to function effectively. This was exemplified by his routine of working until 4:00 a.m. and then continuing to read and experiment without rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39">[23:39]</a>.

He famously expressed his drive by stating, "I've got so much to do, and life is so short, I'm going to hustle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03">[24:03]</a>. This relentless hustle and his determination to never quit until achieving the desired outcome were key elements of his work ethos. Edison's belief that "nothing that's good works by itself; you've got to make the damn thing work" further underscores his philosophy that success required persistent effort and ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

## Managing His Team

Edison's management style was hands-on and inspiring. He worked alongside his employees, often covered in grease and dirt, and this willingness to roll up his sleeves earned him the respect and loyalty of his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. One of the key aspects of Edison's management was his ability to make work interesting and meaningful for his employees. He instilled a sense of purpose in them, making them feel they were not just workmen, but also collaborators in the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06">[48:06]</a>.

This management style fostered an environment that encouraged perpetual motivation and relentless productivity. While Edison kept his men at work for long hours, he led by example, often working longer hours than anyone else, which reinforced his position as not only a leader but also a part of the collective team striving towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11">[37:11]</a>.

## Focus on Experimentation and Learning

Edison's work ethic also emphasized constant learning and experimentation. He was a voracious reader and learner, consuming a vast amount of information to inform his inventions. His method of 'complete knowledge' ensured he had a thorough understanding of any field he ventured into, a testament to his belief in being well-prepared and informed before experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55">[37:55]</a>.

As a learning machine, Edison continually sought new methods and materials, testing thousands of different possibilities to achieve his objectives, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

His approach not only contributed to his immense success but also left an indelible mark on how future generations conceived the role of a leader in innovation.

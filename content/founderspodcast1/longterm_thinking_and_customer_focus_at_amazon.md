Amazon's growth and success have been deeply rooted in its unwavering commitment to long-term thinking and an obsessive focus on customers. These principles, championed by its founder Jeff Bezos, have been instrumental in shaping the company's strategies and market leadership.

## The Foundation: Bezos's 1997 Shareholder Letter

Jeff Bezos's first shareholder letter in 1997 laid the groundwork for Amazon's long-term strategic vision. He emphasized that the company aspires to create an "enduring franchise" by using the internet to offer real value to customers. By focusing on customer-centricity, Amazon aims to build lasting relationships and solidify its position in online commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Strategy for Endurance

Bezos envisioned Amazon moving quickly to capture market leadership, even in established markets. He acknowledged that pursuing such opportunities involves significant risk and investment. However, the ultimate success measure for Amazon is the shareholder value it creates over the long term. Market leadership, he argued, would naturally lead to higher revenue, profitability, and stronger returns on invested capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Customer Obsession as a North Star

A relentless focus on customer obsession has always been central to Amazon’s philosophy. Bezos emphasized that Amazon's decisions frequently prioritize maximizing long-term cash flows over immediate profit appearance. The company has been committed to making bold investments where there is a potential for market leadership advantages, acknowledging that not all investments will pay off while emphasizing the value of lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Value, Innovation, and Listening to Customers

From the outset, Amazon offered customers compelling value, starting with books—the company’s initial offering provided far greater selection than physical stores, in a 24/7 open, easy-to-navigate format. This was coupled with a determination to lower prices, enhancing customer value further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The 1998 shareholder letter highlighted Amazon’s vision of building the world’s most customer-centric company. Bezos expressed that Amazon employees should be more concerned about serving customers rather than being complacent about competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Investing for the Long Run

Bezos outlined the importance of Amazon's long-term investment approach, highlighting patience as a virtue in building sustainable value. With the understanding that great opportunities like those Amazon was pursuing would inherently involve risk, Bezos even pegged his chances of initial success at a modest 30%. This humility and readiness to embrace risk underscore the depth and breadth of Amazon's long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Guarding Against Day Two

In his 2017 shareholder letter, Bezos described "Day Two" as stasis followed by irrelevance, and decline. To fend off "Day Two," Amazon focuses on maintaining a Day One energy through customer obsession, resisting proxies in place of real metrics, eagerly adopting external trends, and maintaining high-velocity decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

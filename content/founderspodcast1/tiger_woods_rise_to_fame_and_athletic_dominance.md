Tiger Woods is a name synonymous with excellence in golf and sports in general. His journey to becoming the most celebrated golfer and one of the most prominent athletes of modern times is marked by extraordinary talent, rigorous discipline, and an unparalleled competitive spirit.

## The Beginning of a Legend

Tiger Woods emerged as a prodigy at a very young age. As early as five years old, he had already appeared on national television, showcasing a golf ability that was prodigious beyond belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Woods's early life was defined by an intense training regimen, overseen by his father, Earl Woods, a former Green Beret who believed in psychological warfare to toughen his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Comparing to the Greats

Woods's path to greatness is often compared to that of Mozartâ€”both prodigies, spurred by domineering fathers who recognized their talents and pushed them from an early age. Earl Woods's claim that Tiger wielded more power to influence the world than Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, or Buddha stands as a testament to his belief in Tiger's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Dominance in Sport

During his prime, Woods ushered in a period where his presence on the golf course was akin to a human whirlwind of drama and entertainment. His ability to produce heart-stopping performances led to golf surpassing even the NFL and NBA in viewership ratings at the height of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Woods, much like [[michael_jordans_comeback_and_mentality | Michael Jordan]], possessed intense discipline, an obsession with practice, and a focus that set him apart from contemporaries. His competitive nature allowed him to dominate the Southern California junior circuit in a way that was described as being a decade ahead of his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

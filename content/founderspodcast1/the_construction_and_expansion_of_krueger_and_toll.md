Krueger and Toll was a prominent construction firm established by [[the_psychological_and_strategic_tactics_used_by_ivar_kreuger | Ivar Kreuger]] and his partner, Swedish engineer Paul Toll. This firm played a significant role in the expansion of Ivar Kreuger’s financial empire and served as a foundation for his ventures into various industries, including the infamous Swedish Match monopoly.

## Foundation of Krueger and Toll

Ivar Kreuger initially ventured into construction after gaining experience in America. Inspired by American methods, he returned to Sweden with the ambition to innovate and transform the construction industry there. His meeting with Paul Toll, facilitated by Julius Khan, the inventor of a method for making iron called Khan iron, led to the formation of Krueger and Toll. The firm was destined to become one of Europe's top construction companies within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Innovations and Realignment of Incentives

One of the defining features that set Krueger and Toll apart from other firms was Ivar's ability to realign incentives in the construction industry. Typically, construction projects were plagued by delays, causing financial loss to clients. Ivar identified this misalignment and offered a novel solution: Krueger and Toll would assume the risk of project delays themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

This reshaped the firm's reputation and client relationships, making it a preferred choice for those seeking reliability and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Rapid Expansion and Success

This innovative approach led Krueger and Toll to accrue a series of successful projects, securing its reputation as the best Building Company in Sweden and later, one of the top firms in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. As the firm gained momentum, Ivar utilized his construction success as collateral to expand his business interests further, notably into the match industry by consolidating control over Swedish Match.

## Role in Kreuger’s Broader Financial Empire

Krueger and Toll was instrumental in supporting Ivar Kreuger's broader ambitions. The firm's profitability and solid track record were crucial in convincing American investors to back Ivar's subsequent ventures, including the controversial establishment of monopolies in Swedish Match. This strategy reflected Kreuger's broader business acumen and his understanding of the psychological and financial dynamics of growing a business empire.

## Conclusion

Krueger and Toll's innovative approach to construction contracts and its rapid growth serve as a case study in [[strategies_for_successful_business_expansion | successful business expansion]]. Ivar Kreuger’s ability to leverage this success laid the groundwork for his later, more notorious financial exploits. However, his relentless pursuit of expansion ultimately led to the collapse of his financial empire, underscoring the precarious balance between growth and sustainability in business.

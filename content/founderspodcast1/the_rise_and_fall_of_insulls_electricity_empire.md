Samuel Insull, a name closely tied with the inception and phenomenal growth of the American electric utility industry, is remembered both for his unparalleled contributions and for one of the most dramatic business collapses in history. Insull's journey was marked by visionary expansion, innovations in finance, public relations, and his role in the development of governmental regulation of utilities.

## Early Contributions to the Electricity Industry

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Insull was a pivotal figure in shaping the electricity industry. He began his career as Thomas Edison's private secretary in 1881, eventually becoming a leading executive in Edison's ventures.

## Innovations and Expansion

He was a pioneer in applying load and diversity factors on a large scale, establishing the principles upon which modern utility rates are based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also introduced the concept of the natural monopoly in utility companies and was critical in creating rural electrification and modern public relations strategies for utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## An Unrelenting Drive

Described as possessing near "demonic energy," Insull worked tirelessly, often clocking sixteen-hour days well into his 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Monopoly

While many sought monopolies to raise prices, Insull envisioned growing the customer base to lower costs, making electricity accessible to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. This approach enabled his companies to build some of the largest power stations in the world, achieving tenfold growth in just six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## The Downfall: Leverage and the Great Depression

Despite his successes, [[the_role_of_leverage_in_insulls_business_collapse | Insull's empire]] was critically wounded by over-leverage.

By 1932, his personal fortune of $150 million had evaporated into a net debt, alongside the collapse of his companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

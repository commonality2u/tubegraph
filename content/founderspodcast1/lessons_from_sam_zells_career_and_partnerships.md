## Authenticity and Nonconformity

From an early age, [[sam_zells_entrepreneurial_philosophy | Sam Zell]] recognized his unique perspective and the importance of authenticity over conformity.

## Entrepreneurial Gospel

## Thinking Like an Outlier

One of Zell’s core philosophies is captured in his 'sisms,' like "if everyone is going left, look right." Zell emphasizes the importance of charting one's own path, valuing unconventional wisdom, and trusting one's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

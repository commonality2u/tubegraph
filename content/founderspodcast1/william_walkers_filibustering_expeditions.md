William Walker is a historical figure who embarked on a series of unauthorized military expeditions, known as filibustering, into foreign territories with the aim of seizing control and fostering political revolutions. These activities, particularly in Mexico and Nicaragua, marked a notable period in 19th-century American expansionism, rooted in the ideology of Manifest Destiny.

## The Concept of Filibustering

Filibustering during Walker's time referred to unofficial military expeditions launched without government approval, aimed at supporting political revolutions or secession in foreign countries or territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00">[14:00]</a>.

> The doctrine of Manifest Destiny was a driving force behind many such expeditions, as it was believed that American expansion across the continent was a divine right and inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>.

## Walker's Early Life and Ambitions

Walker was a prodigiously intelligent individual, having mastered multiple languages and graduated from college and medical school at an early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40">[12:40]</a>. However, after failing to save his mother with his medical knowledge, he lost faith in medicine and pursued careers in law and journalism before embarking on his infamous military ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00">[14:00]</a>.

## The Mexican Expedition

Walker's initial filibustering effort targeted Baja California and Sonora in Mexico. Although he declared himself president of the short-lived Republic of Sonora, his expedition ultimately failed, resulting in his retreat to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52">[15:52]</a>.

## The Nicaraguan Campaign

Walker's most infamous campaign occurred in Nicaragua, where he initially intervened in a civil war at the behest of one faction. He was able to seize control and declare himself president by 1856, imposing American-style governance and even attempting to reintroduce slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59">[22:59]</a>.

### Conflict with Cornelius Vanderbilt

Walker’s seizure of the transit operations in Nicaragua, owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt, led to significant conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00">[34:00]</a>. Walker appropriated Vanderbilt’s assets in an attempt to fund his government, not anticipating Vanderbilt's retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00">[33:00]</a>. Vanderbilt instigated and funded a coalition of Central American states to remove Walker from power. Walker ultimately surrendered to U.S. forces sent to ensure his departure from Nicaragua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53">[52:53]</a>.

## Walker's Demise

Despite the failures in Nicaragua, Walker attempted to re-engage in filibustering expeditions. His repeated attempts and subsequent failure to conquer new territories resulted in his execution by the Honduran government in 1860 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39">[53:39]</a>.

## Legacy

William Walker's filibustering activities highlight a turbulent era of American expansionist history. His ventures underscore the complexities of amateur colonialism, imperial ambition, and the often reckless arrogance of self-styled adventurers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:23">[54:23]</a>.

William Walker's expeditions remain a significant chapter in the study of American expansionism and serve as a cautionary tale of the consequences of overreach and the ethical boundaries of sovereignty and intervention.

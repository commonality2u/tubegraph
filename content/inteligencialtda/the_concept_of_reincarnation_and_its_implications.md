The concept of reincarnation, as discussed, is explored through the lens of [[philosophy and theological interpretations | spiritual revelations]] and ancient mythologies, positing a cyclical journey of the soul tied to unresolved issues and accumulated experiences across lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>.

## Logic and Memory in Reincarnation

A common question regarding reincarnation is why individuals do not remember their past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The explanation provided suggests that this lack of memory is due to the inability to "get rid of the three little ghosts" when the physical body dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>.

### The Three "Little Ghosts" (Lower Quaternary)

According to ancient Hindu-Aryan traditions, particularly the Upanishads, three "little ghosts" or bodies are formed when a zygote appears after an egg is fertilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:48">[02:05:48]</a>. These are the lower quaternary, which are added to the physical body:
*   **Emotional Body:** Collects files related to emotions, sensations, and sentimental fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a>.
*   **Mental Body:** Stores files related to concepts, attitudes, and conceptual attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:31">[02:06:31]</a>.
*   **Etheric Double/Double Fluid:** Contains algorithmized and protocoled files related to cravings and addictions (e.g., desire for pudding, sex, drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:24">[02:05:24]</a>.

For the spirit to be released, these three lower bodies must also "die" or be cleansed of their disturbing files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. If these bodies contain negative or unresolved attachments, they become anchored to the self, and since the brain is either buried or cremated, these "ghosts" attach to the spirit (Immortal Triad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:32">[02:14:32]</a>.

### The Immortal Triad (Spirit)

The Immortal Triad refers to the true spirit, comprising:
*   **Atmic Body:** The soul, representing the presence of the Sacred in each spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>.
*   **Buddhic Body:** (Implicitly related to divine wisdom/enlightenment).
*   **Manasic Body:** Corresponds to higher mental and emotional attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:12">[02:07:12]</a>.

Each human being is described as being composed of these seven bodies (physical, three lower quaternary, and three higher quaternary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a>.

## Karma and Incarnational Programming

The concept of reincarnation is intrinsically linked to karma, which dictates the generation of new bodies to process the "dirty code" from previous lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:45">[02:14:45]</a>. This process can continue for an "eternity," as there are problems to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>.

Karma is categorized into three types:
1.  **Sanchita Karma:** The general bank of all files and experiences from many lives, managed by the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Prarabdha Karma:** An incarnational program for a specific life, which is largely predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>.
3.  **Agam Karma:** The way an individual faces or goes through the predetermined challenges in their life, representing their free will and merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:08">[02:17:08]</a>.

The speaker notes that while there is free will in *how* one goes through life's challenges, many things are predetermined by this incarnational program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:40">[02:16:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:47">[02:16:47]</a>.

## Purpose of Reincarnation

New human beings are generated not out of an act of love from the spirit, but out of a "brutal, selfish" need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>. It's a necessity because there's no other option for spirits to resolve the issues accumulated in their files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>. They create "new characters" who are like prisoners within the "walls" of their incarnational program, limited by the baggage of files from many lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:24">[02:16:24]</a>.

## Unresolved Attachments and the Afterlife

If individuals die with strong attachments or vices (e.g., sex addiction, food addiction), their "self" continues to exist uninterruptedly with these desires, even without a physical body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:12">[02:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:17">[02:05:17]</a>. They might end up in a "spiritual hospital" to be "weaned" from these vices, essentially a place for recovery for spirits with vices and psychological affections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>.

Some spirits, particularly sex addicts, might get stuck in a "mental loop" and try to interact with humans who are engaging in these activities (sex, drinking, drugs) to "feed" on the effluvia, connecting to the humans' neural networks (connectome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Detachment and Mantras for a Dignified Passing

The speaker emphasizes the importance of detachment from earthly things—money, children, spouses, parents—as attachment is considered the cause of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>. This aligns with ancient wisdom, like that of Buddha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>.

To ensure a dignified passing and a favorable transition in the afterlife, the Tibetan Book of the Dead offers a technique called "Poa," the art of dying and living well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:02">[02:11:02]</a>. This technique suggests that the last thought a human being has determines how their "self" arrives in [[religious and spiritual beliefs about the afterlife and divine grace | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.

The recommended practice is to create and continuously repeat a mantra, ensuring it is present in one's mind at the moment of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:24">[02:11:24]</a>. The speaker shares two personal mantras:
1.  "Father, I surrender myself to you with joy, love, trust, and gratitude." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:48">[02:11:48]</a>
2.  "I can align myself with myself and rest in the good and in the decency that is in me and in my similar." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:54">[02:11:54]</a>

This practice allows for self-management and control of the mind, ensuring a dignified pulse at the time of physical death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>. The speaker highlights that "what you think, you create; what you feel, you attract; what you aspire to be, becomes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:17">[02:12:17]</a>.

## Personal Revelation and Belief

The speaker states that they "fortunately know" that reincarnation is real, though they don't have scientific proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:38">[02:13:38]</a>. They believe that humans will return multiple times, an aspect which "sucks" about eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. The spirit animating the speaker has been human around "20 or 30 and few times," and has shown some of its past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>.

The speaker notes that humans generally lack easy access to memories of past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:04">[02:15:04]</a>, attributing this to the limited human condition and the "seals and locks" in the brain that prevent full access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>.

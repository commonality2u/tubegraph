The podcast hosts engaged with [[Public figures | political figures]] to discuss health, quality of life, and the sport of bodybuilding, leading to both opportunities and significant controversy.

## Initial Contact and Podcast Invitation
The president's advisor initiated contact, expressing the president's desire to meet the hosts, particularly "Muse," as he knew and followed their work on Instagram, recognizing them as a "reference within Brazilian Fitness" regarding health and quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. This led to an invitation for the president to appear on their podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. The anticipated topics included discussions on sport and representing various health-related professional categories, such as physiotherapists, physical educators, and nutritionists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. The hosts also aimed to introduce the president to the sport of bodybuilding, which they believed he was unfamiliar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

## Facing Controversy and Criticism
The decision to host the president brought significant [[Accusations and controversies surrounding political figures | responsibility and controversy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. The hosts, being outside the [[Political debate on Brazilian politics | political area]], anticipated entering a "very controversial situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Upon announcing the live interview, one host lost 25,000 subscribers on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>, indicating the polarization of [[Brazilian political debates | Brazilian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

### Nature of the Attacks
The hosts expressed negative surprise at the nature of the attacks, which came from members of political parties, [[Public figures | political figures]], and well-known individuals from other podcasts and online movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. These attacks often involved "disqualifying" the hosts with "foul language," "offense," and "aggressiveness," rather than discussing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
The attacks misrepresented the podcast's purpose, turning discussions about reduced supplement taxes into a joke about "teaching him how to speak Whey Protein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. They also branded the hosts as "Bolsonarist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>, a common tactic in the current [[Public perceptions and controversies | polarized environment]] where differing opinions lead to immediate judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

### Threats and Media Involvement
The controversy escalated to threats against the hosts' families, which was described as "hard" and characteristic of "extremists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. A portion of the [[Role and impact of media in shaping public opinion | media]] was seen as being on the "Extreme side," with one newspaper highlighting negative tweets about the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Despite the attacks, one host's Twitter followers increased from 2,000 to 250,000, as "haters" inadvertently promoted their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

## Podcast Objectives and Impact
The primary objective of the podcast was to seize the "opportunity to speak with the president" as the federal representative of [[Public Policy and Economic Growth Strategies | Public Power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. The hosts aimed to introduce the sport of bodybuilding to a wider audience, arguing it is now "more popular than football" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>, with more people doing it without professional monitoring than attending football schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

Key discussion points brought to the president's agenda included:
*   **Education:** Specifically, bringing a nutrition basis to early childhood education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
*   **Physical Education:** Addressing its lack of mandatory status in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>, which contributes to children's sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

The hosts felt they successfully represented their professional category and presented a sport to millions of people in a respectful manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. They noted that their interview style was perceived as "more respectful than journalists who are experts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>, as their intention was to have a pleasant chat rather than provoke the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. The president's willingness to admit when he didn't know an answer and call a minister for a response was seen as an act of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

## Evolution of Media and Political Engagement
The hosts observed a shift in the media landscape, noting that there is no longer a "monopoly of the big Media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Presidents and governors now appear on independent podcasts, indicating that one no longer needs a large organization to "do something important" or "generate news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. Other [[Public figures | political candidates]], like Ciro, also appeared on their podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This shift highlights [[The role of technology in changing political landscapes | the increasing relevance of digital platforms]] in [[Discussion on political ideologies and critiques | political discourse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.

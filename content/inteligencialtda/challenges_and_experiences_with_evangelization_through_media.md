Evangelization through media has undergone significant evolution, driven by the need to reach broader audiences and adapt to modern communication methods. The speaker's journey into media evangelization began with a profound inspiration from Pope St. John Paul II, who advocated for evangelizing "with new ardor, evangelize with new methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. This vision aimed to bring the message of Jesus Christ to people through all imaginable forms, including radio, television, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.

## Early Innovations in Evangelization
Initially, the approach to evangelization involved using music to engage parishioners. The speaker recorded their first CD with religious songs, playing them through a horn system in the parish to encourage participation in church services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This innovative use of music helped to revitalize the mass, making it a "wonderful thing" and increasing attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. The inclusion of instruments like guitars and drums, common in evangelical churches but not traditionally in Catholic services at the time, was also introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This marked an early step in overcoming [[challenges_and_experiences_in_spreading_the_gospel]] by adapting methods.

## Migration to Radio and Television
The transition to broader media began with an invitation to host a radio show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. Initially, the program faced [[challenges_of_migrating_to_television]] due to an unfavorable time slot (1 PM on AM radio) and lack of budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. However, parishioners' calls for specific songs and questions helped boost engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This success led to an expanded daily slot from 9 AM to 10 AM, even running adjacent to popular programs by other priests like Padre Marcelo Rossi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. Today, the radio program is retransmitted live on 1,620 radio stations across Brazil, reaching an estimated 50 to 150 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

Simultaneously, the speaker transitioned to television, initially hesitant about the format of "mass on TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. This led to forming a band called "Ministry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>, and the program has continued for 20 years, airing every Sunday at 8 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The expansion also included acquiring Catholic TV licenses that were at risk of being lost, ultimately leading to a network of 166 TV repeaters across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

## Evolution of Evangelization Methods during the Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique [[experiences_and_insights_on_evangelization_and_church_influence]]. The speaker found that an empty church for mass was impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>. In response, an initiative was launched where people sent photos of themselves, which were then printed and placed in the church benches during televised masses, creating a sense of virtual presence. Over 100,000 photos were received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

Other innovative methods included:
*   **Drive-thru Communion**: People drove their cars, listened to mass on the radio, and received communion through their car windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   **Drive-in Mass**: Services were held at a venue like the Paulo Leminski quarry, where people parked their cars and participated in mass from inside, using car horns for "amens" and light signals for "hallelujahs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
*   **Solidarity Lives**: Inspired by country singers, online "lives" were organized, collecting 830 tons of food and nearly 1 million food items for those affected by tragedies across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

These initiatives highlighted the "highest moment of entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a> and a surprising surge in charity during the pandemic.

## Impact and Challenges of Media Evangelization
The shift to media allowed for a wider reach, connecting with people in remote locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. The distinction is made between preaching to a large, often one-time audience (where the message must be immediately impactful) and a consistent community (where faith can be built over time through catechesis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. The speaker emphasizes a "catechetical" approach in daily programs, focusing on forming consciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

One challenge faced was the speaker's own reaction to widespread recognition. Seeing their face on merchandise like T-shirts initially caused shock and introspection, prompting a realization that this fame could be a tool for evangelization, a "bait of the moment" to draw people to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. This self-reflection led to the creation of an evangelization association, "Evangelizing is Necessary," 17 years ago, focusing on spreading the message of Jesus Christ through all media forms and supporting charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

The effectiveness of this [[podcast_and_media_influence]] is evident in the feedback received from listeners, with many testifying that specific messages on the radio prevented them from committing suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. The program consistently leads in audience ratings, even among non-Catholic listeners, due to the sharing of life stories and the "living word" of the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. The belief is that God uses individuals and platforms to touch lives, leading to miracles and conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>.

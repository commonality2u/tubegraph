This site, called "rank guy," gained significant access but was eventually shut down due to users uploading inappropriate content, including photos of naked minors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>.

    *   **Guitar Chord Website:** He developed a guitar chord website with unique features like real-time tone changes and chord diagrams, which was innovative for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44">[05:44:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:10">[05:56:10]</a>.

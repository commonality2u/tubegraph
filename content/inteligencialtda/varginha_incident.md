The [[brazilian_ufo_and_mystery_cases | Varginha incident]] is considered an emblematic case in Brazilian ufology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. It is one of three major Brazilian UFO cases, alongside Operation Plate and the Official Night of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. The incident occurred in 1996 in Varginha, Minas Gerais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>, and involved military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Despite controversies, it is largely considered an uncontroversial case among ufologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:40">[02:25:40]</a>.

## Alleged Events

The incident began with an alleged UFO crash in Varginha on January 20, 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>. The object was reportedly shot down and seen descending with white smoke, while pieces swung from its back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:09">[02:31:09]</a>. Creatures reportedly jumped from the object and took refuge in a forest near the Andere garden, spreading out by the Green River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:17">[02:32:17]</a>.

### Creature Sightings and Captures

At least ten creatures were reportedly seen in Grandpa's pasture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:25">[02:32:25]</a>. At least four, possibly more, were captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:31">[02:32:31]</a>. Captured creatures were taken to hospitals in Varginha, including Humanitas by Regional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a>. One creature allegedly died and was transported along with two living ones to Badan Palhares at Unicamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:49">[02:32:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

Nurses reportedly cared for a living creature, attempting blood counts with machines that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:54">[02:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:18">[02:34:18]</a>. The machines were then sent for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:20">[02:34:20]</a>. The creatures are described as having red eyes and small bumps on their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>. A hairy creature with red eyes and horns was also reportedly seen in the Rio Verde area on July 4th, 1996, by a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:36">[02:50:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>.

### Dona Terezinha's Testimony and Zoo Deaths

Dona Terezinha, an elderly woman, reported seeing a creature with golden armor-like skin and red eyes grasping a fence at the Varginha zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>. She described being so frightened that her cigarette burned her hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

In the days following her sighting, several zoo animals with unusual eating habits, including a tapir, blue macaw, and red deer, started dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:37">[02:46:37]</a>. Tests on the animals revealed "poisoning by unknown caustic substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:27">[02:47:27]</a>, with injuries appearing to be from the bottom up, as if from cutaneous absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. This coincided with the death of Marco Eli, a military officer who died after taking a scratch that may have led to an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:03">[02:48:03]</a>. Doctors later identified a strong bacteria, though they stopped short of attributing it to the creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:30">[02:48:30]</a>.

### Military and Government Involvement

The Brazilian military, including the Army and Military Police, firefighters, and hospital staff, were allegedly involved in covering up and denying the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:07">[02:52:07]</a>. Military personnel involved in the operations were later transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:18">[02:41:18]</a>. There is a strong suggestion that military personnel were forced to sign confidentiality agreements by their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>.

Reports indicate cooperation between the Brazilian Army and Air Force with the US government on UFO cases, with material and non-human bodies allegedly transferred to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:28">[02:37:28]</a>. The US Air Force (USAF) was reportedly involved in operations, with a C-17 plane allegedly transporting captured creatures from Viracopos to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:30">[02:34:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:44">[02:36:44]</a>. One creature was supposedly taken directly to a US base without passing through Unicamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>.

The **Varginha incident** was classified as "Top Secret" and remains in intelligence files, making its release difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>.

## Controversy and Debates

There is a significant debate among ufologists regarding the [[varginha_ufo_incident_and_government_coverups | Varginha incident and government coverups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:26">[02:40:26]</a>. Some researchers involved in the case, such as Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues and Pacatini, reportedly changed their stance or became uncommunicative after military police investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:06">[02:41:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:35">[02:41:35]</a>. This change of attitude is attributed to pressure and intense interrogations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:32">[02:42:32]</a>.

The lack of definitive physical evidence like creature photos or videos is a major point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>. A documentary filmmaker, James Fox, offered a reward of $200,000 for original footage or images of the ETs from Varginha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>, though his offer has also led to concerns about potential fake evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:38">[02:29:38]</a>.

## Current Status and Impact

The [[varginha_ufo_incident_and_government_coverups | Varginha incident]] continues to be a subject of intense interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:24">[02:56:24]</a>. The city has embraced the UFO theme, with an ET Memorial and related tourism initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:21">[02:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:37">[02:55:37]</a>. Recently, a book was launched by journalist Margarida Rala, offering new insights from a non-ufologist perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Researchers continue to collect testimonies and information, including from military sources, while prioritizing anonymity to protect witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:31">[02:56:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>.

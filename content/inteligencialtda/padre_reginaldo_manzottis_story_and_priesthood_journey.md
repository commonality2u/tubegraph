Padre Reginaldo Manzotti's journey to priesthood and his subsequent work in evangelization is marked by a blend of personal faith, innovative methods, and deep theological reflection. His path began with a miraculous birth and evolved through challenging seminary years, a transformative spiritual experience, and a commitment to spreading the Gospel through media.

## Early Life and Vocation

Padre Manzotti was born to a devout Catholic family, with his father dedicated to charity and nursing homes, and his mother involved in the apostolate of prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. His birth itself was considered a miracle, as his mother was 43 years old and faced a difficult pregnancy with an umbilical cord issue that led doctors to believe he wouldn't survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. He was baptized in the hospital, and his mother vowed that if he survived, he would be a tribute to Our Lady of Aparecida, leading to his middle name, Aparecido <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Despite his religious upbringing, Manzotti recalls a mischievous childhood, playing games, and even stealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. His initial call to the priesthood came at 11 years old, inspired by his parish priest who played piano and preached wonderfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. He found a magazine asking "Do you want to be a priest?" and wrote to the seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. To his surprise, a German priest later appeared at his school looking for him, inviting him to the seminary, a decision he pursued despite initial hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

## Seminary and Education

Padre Manzotti entered the minor seminary at 12 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. His seminary education included:
*   **Minor Seminary:** Three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.
*   **Philosophy:** Three years, described as a "revolutionary" phase that exposed him to freedom of thought, including figures like Che Guevara and Axl Rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Philosophy was crucial for him, as it helped him develop a mental structure and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. He studied various philosophies, even those denying God, which he found important for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
*   **Theology:** Four years, described as a direct search for God, preparing him for priesthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

A significant advantage of his seminary experience was studying outside the seminary, allowing him contact with peers in state schools and avoiding the creation of an "unreal" isolated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. During his studies, he questioned his path and even fell in love, considering leaving the seminary to start a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>. This period was a "fight between the brain and the heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:13]</a>.

## Spiritual Journey and Challenges

Manzotti initially opposed the Charismatic Renewal, viewing it as a "delay" in the Church, influenced by the era of liberation theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. However, he had a profound [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | personal experience]] at a Charismatic Renewal meeting where he was "baptized in the Holy Spirit," leading to a significant [[personal_transformation_and_faith | conversion within his conversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>. This transformed his fervor, prayer life, and desire for the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.

He later experienced an "identity crisis" in his priesthood, feeling frustrated with his assignment to a wealthy school after 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:03:00">[40:03:00]</a>. A wise spiritual director, Bishop Dom Pedro Fedalto, helped him realize it wasn't a vocational crisis but an identity crisis, encouraging him to redefine his priesthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>.

## Priesthood and Evangelization through Media

Padre Manzotti was ordained a priest in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. He initially served as a Carmelite, living in a rigid religious community, but found he lacked "patience for community life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. After transitioning from teaching, he was assigned to a parish in a peripheral neighborhood, Saint Joseph the Worker in Pinhais, which became his "first love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>.

Inspired by Pope John Paul II's call to "evangelize with new ardor, new methods, new expression," Manzotti began innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a>. His initiatives included:
*   **Engaging the Community:** He noticed people weren't coming to church, so he bought a powerful sound system to play religious music and ring a bell at 7:30 AM on Sundays, urging people to attend Mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.
*   **Music Ministry:** He recorded his first CD with religious songs, incorporating modern instruments like guitar and drums into Catholic Mass, which was uncommon at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>. He has since recorded 15 CDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:48:00">[46:48:00]</a>.
*   **Radio Evangelization:** He started a one-hour AM radio show at 13:00, which he later moved to a daily morning slot. This program is now retransmitted live on 1620 radio stations across Brazil, reaching an estimated 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a>.
*   **Media Acquisition:** His bishop encouraged him to acquire radio stations that were at risk of being sold to other denominations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:14:00">[54:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Evangelizing is Necessary" Association:** Recognizing his growing influence, he founded this association 17 years ago to evangelize through all forms of media (radio, television, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>. The association also has a strong charity pillar, assisting 10,000 children monthly and supporting hospitals and nursing homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:14:00">[58:14:00]</a>.
*   **Television Presence:** He now broadcasts on 166 TV repeaters across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:29:00">[57:29:00]</a>.

Manzotti recounts a moment of humility when he saw someone wearing a t-shirt with his face on it, initially bothered by what he perceived as pride. His spiritual director helped him understand that if God was using his image to evangelize, he should allow it as a "bait of the moment" for people to reach God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>.

## Insights and Beliefs as a Priest

Padre Manzotti shares his perspectives on various theological and social issues:

### Preaching Style
He adapts his preaching to the audience: for large crowds he uses "enigmatic" preaching to announce Jesus Christ and inspire immediate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:41:00">[59:41:00]</a>. For his regular community and media programs, he is more "catechetical" and calm, building conscience over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:010">[01:00:10]</a>.

### Pandemic Reflections
He believes the pandemic was not God's punishment but a "corrective" allowed due to human freedom and the misuse of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. He observed both the best and worst of humanity during this time, noting that it forced people to return to essentials and confront issues within their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. He emphasized learning from the pandemic, particularly the concept of humanity as a "common house" where interconnectedness and sharing are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

### Social Values
Manzotti stresses the importance of basic courtesies like "Excuse me," "Please," and "Thank you" for maintaining healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. He highlights that the devil targets two institutions: the family and the church, seeking to infiltrate them with evil and counter-values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. He emphasizes forgiveness as a one-sided act that removes evil from the heart, even if reconciliation isn't immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

### Mental Health and Faith
He addresses the rising rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, recommending seeking professional psychiatric help alongside faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. He believes that gratitude helps people focus on what they have, and that praise music can be a tool for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. He reassures those in pain that "the storm passes" and encourages them to trust in Jesus's healing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. He recounts miracles of healing he has witnessed through faith and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>.

### Catholic Theology
*   **Celibacy:** While seeing celibacy as a "great value" that allows priests to focus their energies on God's work, he believes that in the future, married priests will be "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.
*   **Exorcism:** Manzotti discusses exorcism as an "exceptional case of possession" where the enemy takes over mental faculties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>. He notes that exorcist priests require special appointment and must live a very serious life of confession and communion, as the "wear and tear of the fight is very big," often leading to early deaths from cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>. He recounts a powerful personal experience where he encountered a possessed girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>.
*   **Dogmas and Tradition:** He clarifies that Catholic dogmas, such as the Assumption of Our Lady, are not inventions but beliefs that the Church has held since its origin, which were later formalized. This differs from the "Sola Scriptura" principle of Lutherans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:22">[02:33:22]</a>.
*   **The End Times:** He explains the Catholic understanding of two comings of Jesus (the first in the manger, the second glorious return) and emphasizes that we are currently living in the "time of the Holy Spirit" between these two events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Afterlife:**
    *   **Private Judgment:** Upon death, each individual undergoes a private judgment, where their life passes "like a movie in the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.
    *   **Heaven, Purgatory, Hell:** He describes three destinations: Heaven (for those with intimacy and love for God), Purgatory (a period of purification for those who tried but had flaws), and Hell (the pain of absence from God's love for those who deliberately denied Him) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:50">[02:01:50]</a>. He clarifies that Hell is not a fire but the "absence of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>.
    *   **Limbo:** He states that the concept of Limbo for unbaptized children or animals has been discarded by the Church; children who die are "the purest creatures" around the Throne of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:34">[02:20:34]</a>.
    *   **Suicide:** Referencing Saint Augustine, he states that it's difficult for a suicide to go to hell because it requires "full awareness" and a deliberate break with God. He encourages acts of reparation, such as charity or having Masses said, for those who have lost loved ones to suicide or who died in a state of sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:55">[02:28:55]</a>.
*   **Infant Baptism:** He advocates for infant baptism, believing it brings three gifts: becoming a child of God, a member of the Church, and incorporated into Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:39">[02:38:39]</a>. He encourages grandparents to ensure their grandchildren are baptized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:30">[02:40:30]</a>.

Padre Manzotti admits that his biggest personal question for God is why innocent children suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:12">[02:44:12]</a>, a question even Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged not having a full answer to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:54">[02:44:54]</a>.

The traditional celebration of Christmas on December 25th is a widely accepted practice, yet its historical and biblical accuracy is often questioned. Many Christmas traditions, such as raisins in food, Santa Claus, and pine trees, have roots outside of the biblical narrative [00:45, 01:47, 07:32, 07:53, 11:47].

## Historical and Biblical Arguments Against December 25th

Biblical scholars and historians propose that [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] was not born on December 25th.
Arguments against this date include:

*   **Shepherds in the Field** The Bible describes shepherds in the field at night guarding their sheep when [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. December in that region is freezing, making it unlikely for shepherds and their flocks to be out in the open overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Lambs' Birth Season** Lambs are typically born in late spring, specifically between March and the beginning of April, which is the Hebrew month of Abib (later Nissan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Shepherds would be in the fields at night during this period to care for the birthing ewes and their newborn lambs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Bethlehem and Sacrifice Lambs** Bethlehem, located 8 km from [[historical_significance_of_jerusalem | Jerusalem]], was known as the city where lambs were prepared for temple sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]], referred to as the "Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world," was born in this city, tying His birth to the sacrificial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Dating Through Related Events

Further evidence against a December birth comes from dating related biblical events:

*   **John the Baptist's Birth** Zacharias, John the Baptist's father, was a priest serving in the temple during the "shift of Abijah," which was the eighth week after Passover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Information from the Dead Sea Scrolls and historical records of the Temple's destruction in 70 AD allow for the precise dating of these priestly shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Mary's Conception** Mary conceived [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] six months into Elizabeth's pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Counting nine months from Mary's conception (around the time of Abijah's shift) leads to a birth date for [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] between March and April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## The Date of Jesus' Birth and the Calendar

The timing of [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]]' birth holds profound spiritual significance:

*   **Calendar Change** God Himself changed the Israelite calendar in Exodus 12, declaring the month of Abib (Nissan) as the first month of the year, just before Passover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This aligns with [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]]' birth coinciding with the new year, symbolizing a "newness of life" that He brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Birth and Death Coincidence** [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] was born in this March-April period and also died during this same period, specifically on Passover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. The timing of His crucifixion mirrored the sacrificial lamb ritual, where lambs were brought into homes on the 10th day of Nissan and sacrificed on the 14th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]] entered [[historical_significance_of_jerusalem | Jerusalem]] on Palm Sunday (10th of Nissan) and was crucified at 9 AM, the same time priests tied sacrificial lambs, and died at 3 PM, when the lambs were slaughtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Year of Birth** Based on the death of Herod the Great in 4 BC (who ordered the killing of male children up to two years old following the Magi's visit), and the Magi's arrival two years after the star's appearance, [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] was likely born around 6 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

## The Magi and the Star of Bethlehem

The "Magi" often depicted as kings, were more accurately Zoroastrian astrologers from Babylon, not necessarily wizards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. At that time, astronomy, astrology, and psychology were intertwined sciences used for understanding temperament and making prophetic observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

*   **The Star** The Star of Bethlehem was likely a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 6 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Jupiter was considered the "King's Planet" in Greek texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Ancient Prophecies** The Magi may have been aware of prophecies from Daniel (who was chief of the magicians in Babylon) and Balaam's prophecy about a coming star, which indicated the birth of a great king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Gifts** The gifts brought by the Magi — gold, frankincense, and myrrh — held symbolic meaning:
    *   **Gold** signified royalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   **Frankincense** represented intercession and spiritual significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
    *   **Myrrh** was a valuable and fragrant but bitter spice, deeply connected to death and embalming, foreshadowing [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]]' eventual sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This gift provided Joseph with the means to support his family during their two-year stay in Egypt, fleeing Herod's persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
*   **God's Revelation** The Magi's journey highlights God's ability to reveal truth even to those outside of traditional religious circles, using tools like astrology, which, while later forbidden due to human misuse, initially provided insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Why December 25th?

The adoption of December 25th for [[religious_perspectives_on_christmas_and_its_historical_symbols | Christmas]] originated with Constantine's conversion between 312 and 315 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.

*   **Pagan Integration** Constantine, who had previously worshipped the sun god, integrated various pagan practices into the Christian religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. December 25th was the traditional birthday of the sun god, celebrated as the longest night of the year, after which the days begin to lengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. This strategic move helped institutionalize Christianity within the Roman Empire by making it more palatable to a pagan populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Secularization of Symbols** Many modern Christmas symbols, like Santa Claus, have secular or even non-Christian origins. Santa Claus, for example, is attributed to an advertising campaign by Coca-Cola that popularized the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. Some argue this was a deliberate attempt to remove the person of Christ from the center of the celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Similarly, the Easter Bunny and Easter eggs derive from pagan fertility rites rather than the biblical narrative of [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]]' resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

## Significance and Celebration

Despite the historical inaccuracies of the date, the act of celebrating [[religious_perspectives_on_christmas_and_its_historical_symbols | Christmas]] remains significant for many Christians.

*   **Glorifying [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]]** The main purpose of celebrating [[religious_perspectives_on_christmas_and_its_historical_symbols | Christmas]] should be to glorify [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]]' name and remember His birth as the Savior of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. Even if the date is historically incorrect, it is a global opportunity for people to hear about and remember Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
*   **Love and Unity** [[religious_perspectives_on_christmas_and_its_historical_symbols | Christmas]] provides a unique opportunity for family gatherings, reconciliation, and expressing love, putting aside differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. It is a time for reflection and striving to be a better person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity** It is important to welcome those who may not have family or who struggle with loneliness during this period, offering them community and belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Core Message** While acknowledging the pagan origins of some traditions, the emphasis should remain on the core message of [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]]' birth, His redemptive work, and the new life He offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:12">[02:05:12]</a>. Engaging in family communion, worship, and prayer helps keep Christ at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Legalism and Judgment** Christians are encouraged to avoid judgmental attitudes regarding celebration practices. The focus should be on love, grace, and respecting others' convictions, rather than strict rules or condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. The Bible emphasizes the condition of the human heart over adherence to external rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>.

> "When [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_Trinity | Jesus]] came he was killed by the Pharisees because he did not enter into these questions he saw the heart of man the what matters is the heart of man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:56">[02:07:56]</a>.

In conclusion, while [[historical_interpretations_of_biblical_events | historical interpretations of biblical events]] suggest [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | Jesus]] was not born on December 25th, the annual [[religious_perspectives_on_christmas_and_its_historical_symbols | Christmas]] celebration remains a powerful opportunity to spread the message of Christ's love and the new life He brings to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:12">[02:05:12]</a>.

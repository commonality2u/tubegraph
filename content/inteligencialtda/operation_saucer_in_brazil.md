[[ufological_incidents_in_brazil | Operation Saucer]], officially known as "Operação Prato" (Operation Plate), was a military investigation initiated by the Brazilian Air Force in response to widespread UFO sightings and aggressive phenomena in the Amazon region, particularly in Pará and Maranhão states, during the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Background and Purpose
The operation was prompted by panic among riverside populations due to strange lights and objects appearing in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>. The military was tasked with investigating these occurrences and providing answers to the distressed communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

## Duration and Scope
While often associated with 1977, Operation Plate lasted from 1976 to 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It is famous for the quantity of reports and the aggressive nature of the phenomena observed during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. The military formed teams of five by five soldiers, totaling 25 military personnel, who were stationed in strategic points like Praia do Machadinho in Colares, Pará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.

## Phenomena and Attacks
The incidents involved mysterious lights and objects that reportedly chased and attacked people, particularly in the region of Colares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. These phenomena were sometimes referred to as "chupa-chupa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
Victims experienced:
*   Physical injuries, including burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>.
*   Limpness and fainting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   Extraction of small portions of blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   Marks left on the chest, neck, and arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   Some cases resulted in death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

One notable account includes Silvia Mara, who was attacked inside her home, along with her husband. The beings used a "flashlight-like" object that seemed to paralyze them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. Her dog, Victoria, was also targeted and subsequently died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. Silvia Mara, who was pregnant at the time, lost her baby and suffered trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

The military also recorded visual sightings of objects, with official reports sometimes describing them as "metallic and round, without wings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

## Evidence and Findings
Operation Plate generated hundreds of pages of documentation, including photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. These documents, along with maps of object trajectories, are now available in the National Archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>.
*   **Clinical Examinations:** Witnesses underwent medical examinations conducted by the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.
*   **Physical Evidence:** In cases of reported landings, the Air Force investigated and detected soil changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Military Conclusion:** The official Air Force report from June 2, 1986, concluded that the observed phenomena were "solid and reflected intelligence" due to their ability to follow and maintain distance from observers, and were "not necessarily manned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:37">[02:16:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>.

## [[military_involvement_in_ufo_sightings | Military Involvement]] and [[international_politics_and_brazils_global_relationships | US Interest]]
Brazilian military personnel involved in the operation included Captain Uyrangê Bolivar Soares de Nogueira Holanda Lima, First Sergeant João Flavio de Freitas, Second Sergeant Moacir Neves de Almeida, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. They used codenames, such as William of Holland using "Ernesto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

The United States showed interest in the incidents, especially due to the aggressive nature of the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. There is evidence of cooperation between the Brazilian and North American governments, with American agents collecting material and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:28">[02:22:28]</a>. Documents from the US embassy, released via the Freedom of Information Act, indicate agreements with the Brazilian Army and Air Force regarding UFO incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>.

## Legacy and Controversy
Despite official investigations, the phenomena were never fully resolved by the Brazilian Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>. The press played a significant role, often sensationalizing reports, which contributed to public panic but also brought attention to real events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

[!WARNING|Stigma]
There was a significant stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings, especially for military personnel and pilots, who feared psychological evaluation or retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

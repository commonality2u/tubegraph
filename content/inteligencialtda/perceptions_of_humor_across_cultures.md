[[comedy_and_cultural_differences_between_countries | Comedy and cultural differences between countries]] are evident in various aspects of life and media, with humor varying significantly between nations and even within subcultures.

## National Humor Styles

### Brazil
Brazilian humor often involves laughing at misfortune and ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. It has a very characteristic tendency to be ridiculed and to laugh at "grace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This type of humor can be seen in common jokes, like one about a taxi driver that could also exist in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. There's a strong culture of memes, which are considered part of the expensive culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Brazilians are described as very playful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:39">[02:20:39]</a>.

### France
French humor (outside of immigrant communities) is often described as drier and more observational, similar to English humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. It can be difficult for Brazilians to understand if it's a joke or if it's meant to be arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. French people are generally more reserved about their private lives on social media, often posting photos that resemble contemporary photography rather than personal updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>.

### Germany
German humor is often perceived as more direct and less prone to offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>. Germans are generally predisposed not to get offended by jokes about Germany and are expected to accept them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:31">[02:52:31]</a>. In comedy shows, Germans might react with silence or embarrassment rather than laughter if jokes are too dark or sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>.

### Angola
Angolan humor, as perceived by a French speaker, shares a fraternal connection with Brazilian humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. It's suggested to be more "fifth grade" in its approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:33">[02:26:33]</a>.

### Offense and Cultural Sensitivity
What is considered funny in one culture might be offensive in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:19">[02:37:19]</a>. Jokes about culturally sensitive topics, such as a Brazilian goalkeeper who killed himself after a World Cup loss, might elicit silence or embarrassment in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>.

A French comedian living in Brazil notes that Brazilians often cannot differentiate between a joke and a serious statement, sometimes interpreting jokes as arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a>. This can lead to xenophobia if people mistakenly believe negative statements are serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

In Brazil, humor is sometimes seen as reinforcing prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:35">[02:38:35]</a>. There is a "wave of criminalization" for many things, which is seen as negative because it devalues real problems and creates more taboos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:45">[02:42:45]</a>. People might go after a joke instead of the real problem, such as racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:26">[02:43:26]</a>.

### Humor and Political Sensitivities
Political humor can be particularly tricky, as demonstrated by the strong reactions to political puns in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:08">[02:48:08]</a>. Brazilians are highly polarized, and even wearing a national team shirt can be seen as a political statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>. Political humor can lead to rapid loss of social media followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:42">[02:49:42]</a>.

In France, a German TV program was canceled and taken to court by the president of Turkey for a joke about him, which was perceived as undervaluing his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. This indicates that while French humor might be considered more open, there are still limits, especially when involving foreign political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:50">[02:40:50]</a>.

### Boundaries of Humor
The question of "limits of humor" is a complex one, with varied perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a>. Some believe one can joke about absolutely everything, as long as the intention is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:28">[02:41:28]</a>. The context where the humor happens is crucial: what's acceptable on the street might be offensive in a theater, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>. Jokes among friends might be seen as prejudiced if said in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>.

There is a movement in some countries, like Brazil, to "criminalize" or "cancel" jokes that touch on sensitive topics, which can be seen as counterproductive as it "devalues real problems" and creates more taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:45">[02:42:45]</a>.

## The Role of Comedy
Comedy is a serious business in Brazil, with stand-up comedians spending hours honing their craft and observing audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. A French comedian notes the challenge of performing stand-up in France, as audiences are less inclined to idolize performers compared to Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:01">[03:34:01]</a>.

## Impact of Social Media
[[The role of social media in spreading comedy | The role of social media in spreading comedy]] is significant, with Brazil being the second country worldwide in time spent on social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:38">[03:38:38]</a>. This provides a large audience for comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:15">[03:33:15]</a>. However, the viral nature of content can also lead to misinterpretations and public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>.

In France and Germany, there's a cultural inclination against over-exposing oneself on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:21">[03:35:21]</a>. German social media use is impacted by historical surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:06">[03:38:06]</a>, leading to a more reserved approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:11">[03:36:11]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the Brazilian tendency to share much of their personal life online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:18">[03:36:18]</a>.

## Language and Humor
Cultural differences in humor are also tied to language and expressions. For example, Brazilians often teach foreigners swear words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:24">[02:55:24]</a> and confusing phrases, which can lead to embarrassing situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>. This highlights the importance of context and local understanding when trying to engage with humor in a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:22">[02:58:22]</a>.

During World War II, both Allied and Axis powers engaged in various mystical and occult pursuits, believing they could gain a strategic advantage. This extended from attempts to create super soldiers to seeking ancient artifacts and using astrological guidance.

## Nazi Germany's Occult Pursuits

The Nazi regime, particularly under figures like Heinrich Himmler, heavily invested in supernatural and spiritual aspects to justify their ideologies and develop military advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Joseph Mengele's experiments were aimed at developing "super soldiers" [[paranormal_soldiers_and_occultism_in_world_war_ii | paranormal soldiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, given unlimited resources and human subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Ideological Justification and Ancient Myths
The Nazis' mystical conception sought to justify their idea of a "German superior race" by reviewing history through theosophy, specifically the writings of Helena Blavatsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This led them to believe they were descendants of Atlantean civilizations, children of Norse Gods like Odin, Thor, and Bor, possessing a "divine DNA" and exceptional skills [[influence_of_mythology_and_religion_on_historical_events | influence of mythology and religion on historical events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This lineage purportedly gave them the right to rule the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

They believed in mobilizing a spiritual energy called "Vril" to become invincible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This concept, along with the "divine right" theory, was a cornerstone of their power system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Secret Societies and Sacred Relics
Meetings and development of these ideas took place within the Thule Society [[influence_of_secret_societies_in_nazi_germany | influence of secret societies in Nazi Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. A key aspect of their quest for invincibility was the acquisition of sacred relics:
*   **The Spear of Longinus**: Believed to have pierced Christ's side, it was the first item Hitler took when invading Austria, retrieving it from a museum in Vienna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The Nazis believed possessing it would make them invincible and allow them to establish a "Third Roman Empire" (Third Reich) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail**: Himmler was particularly focused on these, believing they would release a divine power (Vril) and could be used as weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The pursuit of the Ark is well-documented in the book *The Holy Relics of Hitler* by Sydney Kirk Patrick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Influence of Mythology on Racial Ideologies
The concept of Aryan ancestry linked to Lemuria and Atlantis led to the belief that Aryans were heirs to a race of demigods who ruled Earth before a cataclysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This worldview extended to Hitler's neurosis that full power could only be achieved by eliminating other Atlantean peoples who survived the flood, specifically the Semites (Jewish people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This mystical component, combined with a German legend that Jews betrayed Germany in WWI, fueled the atrocities of the Holocaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Symbolism
Nazi symbolism, like the swastika, was influenced by Germanic mysticism. The swastika, a common symbol in Indian and Iranian cultures, was adapted by the Nazis by bending it 45 degrees to the left, signifying constant change and extracting power from the "dark hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Other symbols like the "Black Sun" were also used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Allied Counter-Occult Efforts

The United States also engaged in paranormal research, influenced by suspicions of Russian psychic spies.

### Project Stargate
Begun in the 1970s, Project Stargate was designed to create military psychics, based at Fort Meade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. It aimed to develop "remote viewing" capabilities in soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Notable participants included:
*   **Ingo Swann**: A psychic whose brain waves were studied to understand remote viewing, leading to a refined protocol that increased accuracy from 20% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Uri Geller**: The famous illusionist participated in the initial phase, known for his ability to bend forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Geller had previously worked for the Israeli army and claimed to have predicted the Munich massacre where Israeli athletes were captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Major Ed Dames and Joseph McMoneagle**: Key military figures involved in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The ultimate goal of Project Stargate was to develop abilities like remote viewing, with the highest level being the ability to "kill a goat just by looking at it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

While publicly declared closed due to a low success rate (20%), former participants argued this rate was significant for "unresolvable" cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The project was allegedly hidden and continued under different names, notably revived after 9/11/2001, and is believed to be in full force today, involving "paranormal soldiers" in highly classified groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Operation Paperclip and Mind Control
After WWII, the U.S. launched Operation Paperclip, bringing top German scientists, including those involved in occult research like Joseph Mengele, to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This influx of knowledge contributed to projects like MK Ultra, a CIA mind control project documented by the Church Commission in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The "K" in MK Ultra is believed to stand for "Kontrol" (German for control), indicating its German origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

MK Ultra involved experimenting with substances to manipulate individuals into committing atrocities and developing "sleeper assassins" or "Manchurian Candidates" through brainwashing and trauma-based mind control [[understanding_the_psychological_effects_of_spiritual_warfare | understanding the psychological effects of spiritual warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. The program sought to create fragmented personalities that could be triggered for specific missions, with the host personality unaware of the assassin persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### British Mystical Battle of Britain
The British also engaged in mystical warfare. Dion Fortune, a British occultist and member of the Golden Dawn society (associated with Aleister Crowley), formed a team of magicians in 1939 to combat the Germans mystically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Unable to meet in person due to bombings, she communicated via letters, instructing her followers to meditate and visualize a "mountain of wisdom" and receive guidance from spiritual masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Their objective was not to curse the Germans but to boost British morale and, later, to conjure mist and fog to hinder German air attacks. Reports suggest that in several battles, an inexplicable mist indeed prevented British defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Fortune concluded her rituals in 1943, confident of Allied victory and even "visualized" the emergence of the United Nations five years before its actual formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This mystical battle was a direct "fight between good wizards and evil wizards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Role of Astrology and Future Implications
Astrology played a role in military planning, with Hitler reportedly using astrologers as consultants. The British psychics, led by Dion Fortune, conducted psychic espionage to discover the advice Hitler was receiving from his astrologers, allowing them to prepare countermeasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

The belief in external influences persists today. Elon Musk's interest in colonizing Mars is partly attributed to a belief in an impending "geophysical event" or a Third World War, driving the creation of underground bunkers and advanced space technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This also connects to the theory that current military spending on weapons is secretly aimed at combating future alien threats, as suggested by former CIA agent Chase Brandon in his book *The Cryptos Conundrum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This theory aligns with the plot of *The Three-Body Problem* which depicts aliens hindering human technological progress to prevent future conflict.

The influence of occultism is also widely seen in [[the_influence_of_occultism_in_music_and_pop_culture | music and pop culture]], with figures like Stan Lee drawing inspiration from these mystical WWII stories for superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The existence of these documented projects, though often dismissed as conspiracy theories, suggests a deeper, often hidden, engagement with the esoteric in military and intelligence operations [[military_strategies_and_their_evolution_through_history | military strategies and their evolution through history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

[[Jair Bolsonaros political career and presidency | Jair Bolsonaro]] has faced numerous political controversies and legal challenges throughout his career, particularly intensified during and after his presidency. These issues range from accusations of election fraud and alleged coup attempts to investigations into personal conduct and financial matters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>

## Overview of Legal Challenges

Bolsonaro states that his legal troubles began in 2021, while he was President of the Republic, with investigations included in a "fake news" inquiry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a> He claims these inquiries are confidential and secret, preventing access to information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> He argues that the Federal Police (PF) engaged in "evidentiary fishing" (fishing expeditions), which is prohibited by the Supreme Federal Court (STF), by recording phone numbers and then investigating anything suspicious. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> He feels these issues are used to "wear him down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>

## Specific Controversies and Legal Cases

### Ineligibility and Electoral Disputes

Bolsonaro's ineligibility stems from a meeting with ambassadors in July 2021, where he discussed Inquiry 1361 related to alleged electoral fraud in his election. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:39">[02:13:39]</a> He argues that the TSE initiated an inquiry into his claims of election fraud, but when Lula won and his team petitioned the TSE for similar investigations, they received a negative response and a R$22 million fine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a> He believes this demonstrates the TSE's bias against him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>

He criticizes the TSE for:
*   Issuing resolutions less than six months before elections, which he states is illegal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:09">[02:33:09]</a>
*   A resolution in mid-October 2022 (between the first and second rounds) to prevent right-wing pages from freely disclosing his name. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:17">[02:33:17]</a>
*   Prohibiting the use of his September 7th image and pictures of Lula defending abortion or trivializing theft in his campaign. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>
*   Spending money to run a campaign encouraging 16-17-year-olds to get voter IDs, which he claims mostly vote left, giving Lula over 2 million votes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>
*   Labeling eight businessmen, including Luciano Hang, as "scam businessmen" for "talking nonsense" in private conversations and removing Hang's page with 10 million followers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:46">[02:34:46]</a>

Regarding his ineligibility, he mentions being accused of "abuse of political power" for the ambassador meeting and "abuse of economic power" for using Pastor Silas Malafaia's sound car. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a> He believes the rapid judgment of his case, compared to Lula's, is unjust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:09">[02:40:09]</a>

### Jewelry and Gifts Case

Bolsonaro faced scrutiny over gifts of jewelry he received, with the press initially claiming they were worth R$16 million, then R$5 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> He asserts that these "very personal jewels" are considered gifts to the respective former President of the Republic, regardless of value, according to the law and a TCU decision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> He states that everything requested by the Supreme Court and Federal Police was delivered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> He also mentions an incident where a jewelry set intended for his wife, Michelle, was seized at an airport, claiming it was a gift and she wasn't present when it was received by a minister. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> He believes the whole situation was created to "wear down" him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>

### Vaccine Card Forgery Allegations

Bolsonaro claims there were two instances of alleged forgery on his vaccination card:
1.  In Peru, São Paulo, where it appeared he had been vaccinated in the SUS. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a> He claims the email that registered him was "lula@gmail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a> He asked the PF to investigate, but it was inconclusive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>
2.  In Duque de Caxias, he claims he asked the head of the CGU to investigate, and the forgery was ruled out as he never took the vaccine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>

He mentions a search and seizure at his home to obtain his vaccination card, which he views as ridiculous. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a> He also states the PF went to the United States to look for a vaccine card and found none because he never had one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>

### January 8th Events (Coup Allegations)

Bolsonaro rejects accusations of orchestrating a coup on January 8th, 2023. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a> He points out that he was in the United States and condemned the events three times on Twitter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a> He argues that a coup requires armed forces, tanks, leadership, and financing, none of which were present. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a> He also highlights that the only weapon seized was a "stretching and a half two balls of good." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>

He claims the events were "set up" by the opposing side to simulate an attempted coup, drawing parallels to the January 6th Capitol riot in the US, but noting he was no longer president. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a> He states that Abim sent over 30 messages to the GSI about the possibility of riots, but "nobody did anything," suggesting the government stimulated the events. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a> He questions why the Minister of Justice, Flávio Dino, only released four cameras out of 200, alleging that other images were deleted because they would compromise the current government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>

He discusses the "coup minutes" document, stating no such document has been presented. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a> He also dismisses the "green and yellow dagger" story, calling it "childish" and alleging the general whose computer contained it was not heard from. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>

### Marielle Franco Murder Accusations

Bolsonaro recounts being accused for six years of being the "mentor" of the murder of Marielle Franco due to one of the accused living in his condominium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> He dismisses the claim that his son dated the accused's daughter, as the daughter lived in the United States. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> He also refutes the accusation that another participant in the murder called him from his condominium and he authorized their entry, providing an attendance record from the Chamber of Deputies to prove he was not in Rio de Janeiro at the time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> He argues he had no interest in eliminating Marielle Franco, as their political bases were completely different. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

### Whale Harassment Allegation

Bolsonaro was investigated for "harassment of cetaceans" (whales), specifically for being photographed on a jet ski near a whale in Guarujá. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> He claims this report came from someone linked to Marina Silva's ministry and views it as an attempt to "mock" or "scold" him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> He states the police delegate recommended archiving the case, but the Public Prosecutor's Office could still pursue it, potentially leading to 3 to 5 years in prison. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:27">[02:19:27]</a>

### Influence of Judicial Decisions (Alexandre de Moraes, TSE)

Bolsonaro frequently criticizes Minister Alexandre de Moraes and the TSE for what he perceives as judicial overreach and political persecution. He highlights:
*   Moraes allegedly threatening Cid with his father, wife, and daughter to make him sign a plea bargain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>
*   The plea bargain being signed while Cid was imprisoned, which Bolsonaro claims is illegal based on Lava Jato decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>
*   The arrest of his political advisor, Felipe Martins, on the accusation that he fled with Bolsonaro to the US, despite police knowing he was in Brazil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a> Bolsonaro claims Martins was pressured but refused to "report" anything because there was nothing to report. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>
*   The rapid processing of his ineligibility case compared to [[Comparison of Jair Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva | Lula's]] cases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>
*   The TSE's alleged interference in the 2022 elections by banning his campaign from using certain images and promoting voter registration among young people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>
*   The R$22 million fine imposed on his party (PL) for questioning election results, which he calls "sarcasm" and "humiliation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>

He alleges that the rapid decision on his passport, delayed until he announced he wouldn't return to Brazil, was to prevent him from carrying forward information to US authorities about events in Brazil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a> He feels Moraes tries to appear "evil" to intimidate others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>

### Corporate Card Secrecy

Bolsonaro explains that the presidential corporate card has three uses: for the Alvorada residence (staff, food, animal feed), for official trips (delegations, fuel), and a personal card of up to R$20,000/month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a> He claims he never used his personal card and turned over his financial statements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>

He states the secrecy surrounding the card was to protect individuals like his wife's hairdresser and manicurist from malicious people or blackmail, and when the seal was opened, there was nothing confidential. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:31">[02:11:31]</a> He highlights that this secrecy law is from the Dilma Rousseff government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:21">[02:12:21]</a>

### Adélio Bispo Investigation (Attempted Assassination)

Bolsonaro claims the investigation into Adélio Bispo's 2018 assassination attempt was flawed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a> He alleges the Federal Police delegate, Rodrigo Mora Fernandes, who concluded Adélio acted alone, was an admirer of the PT and was later promoted by Lula to the intelligence directorate of the Federal Police. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a> He questions how Adélio, a "poor, miserable" man, could afford to travel or how he knew of his son Carlos's private travel plans. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:54">[02:14:54]</a> He also found it strange that three lawyers, one arriving by private plane, appeared to defend Adélio the day after the attack. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:51">[02:15:51]</a> He mentions a report that Adélio had connections with the PCC, but the investigation concluded it was "without wanting to." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:34">[02:16:34]</a>

### Flávio Bolsonaro's "Cracks" Case

Regarding his son Flávio Bolsonaro's "cracks" case (alleged illicit financial schemes), Bolsonaro states there were 23 similar cases, but only Flávio was investigated, and he views it as an "exaggeration." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:39">[03:10:39]</a> He claims the action was ultimately blocked, and life goes on. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:57">[03:10:57]</a>

## Broader Themes and Criticisms

### Judicial Overreach and Political Persecution

Bolsonaro and his allies frequently accuse the judiciary, particularly the STF and TSE, of exceeding their authority and engaging in political persecution against him and his supporters. They point to:
*   The differing treatment of cases, where right-wing individuals face severe penalties, while left-wing individuals do not. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:59">[02:44:59]</a>
*   The jailing of elderly individuals and women for minor acts on January 8th, citing Débora, a hairdresser sentenced to 14 years for painting a statue with lipstick, as a prime example of "tremendous injustice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>
*   The blocking of his supporters' financial resources and social media accounts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>
*   The concept of "amnesty" as a political remedy to address what they see as unjust sentences for January 8th participants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>

### Economic Policy Criticisms

Bolsonaro contrasts his [[Economic and social policies during Bolsonaros presidency | economic policies]] with the current government's. He highlights:
*   His reduction of federal taxes on fuels, which the current government reinstated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:21">[02:52:21]</a>
*   His concern for informal workers during COVID-19, leading to emergency aid and the *Pix* instant payment system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a> He claims *Pix* was his government's idea, implemented to help 40 million people without bank accounts, and resulted in bankers losing over R$20 billion annually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>
*   The current government's alleged "budget adjustment" allocating R$750 million to the MST (Landless Workers' Movement) and its hostility towards agriculture, including the proposed reactivation of "Red April." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:42">[02:44:42]</a>

### Foreign Interference Claims

Eduardo Bolsonaro claims "external interference" in Brazil's electoral process, citing information from Mike Benz about money sent from the United States (via USAID) to Brazilian entities like the TSE. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a> He states that if USAID hadn't existed, [[Jair Bolsonaros political career and presidency | Jair Bolsonaro]] would still be president. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a> He also suggests China sought the Biden administration to remove Bolsonaro from power, believing they would have greater ease in transactions with another government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>

## Political Strategy and Outlook

Bolsonaro emphasizes his commitment to fighting what he perceives as injustices and restoring balance between the powers. He aims to combat a "psychopath" like Alexandre de Moraes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a> His presence in the United States, according to his son Eduardo, allows him to reach authorities who can help expose the situation in Brazil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>

Despite the legal challenges, Bolsonaro and his allies maintain that he remains a viable candidate, the "greatest right-wing leader," and would win if he ran today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a> They believe the current government's actions only serve to discredit and persecute the conservative movement in Brazil, which they assert is here to stay. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>

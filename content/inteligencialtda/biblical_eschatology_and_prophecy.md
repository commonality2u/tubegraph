[[Biblical prophecies and eschatology | Biblical eschatology and prophecy]] involves the study and [[Interpretations of Biblical prophecy and the end times | interpretations of biblical prophecy and the end times]], particularly concerning events leading up to and including the return of Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15"></a>. This field of study draws from various biblical texts, including Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, Ezekiel 38, Daniel, and Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00"></a>.

## Signs of the End Times
Prophecies indicate that the end times will be characterized by a combination of global events and spiritual shifts. These include:
*   **Wars and Rumors of Wars** Such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31"></a>. The 20th century, particularly marked by two World Wars, established a hegemonic global order, but recent times have seen an unprecedented number of significant wars that have shaken geopolitics locally, regionally, and worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11"></a>.
*   **Diseases and Pandemics** The COVID-19 pandemic connected the element of war and global finitude, aligning with Jesus's warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23"></a>.
*   **Natural Disasters** An increase in the intensity and number of earthquakes above six points on the Richter scale has been observed since the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16"></a>. There are also reports of the Earth spinning faster, which some interpret as a fulfillment of prophecy that "days would be shortened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40"></a>.
*   **Spiritual and Political Signs** Including the rise of false teachers and a general strangeness in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51"></a>.

## Geopolitical Landscape and Prophecy
[[Historical and biblical perspectives | Geopolitics]] is seen as intrinsically linked to end-times prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24"></a>. The current global climate is described as a "barrel of gunpowder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51"></a>.

### Key Global Players
*   **United States (US)**: Currently the greatest world power, but facing internal divisions and economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:57"></a>. Its "policy of ambiguity" regarding Taiwan is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54"></a>. The US holds back the Antichrist's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06"></a>.
*   **China**: A rising power that challenges the US-led order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54"></a>. China is the world's largest importing and trading country, with its economy being crucial globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57"></a>. Its 5G technology gives it immense global control and surveillance capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:21"></a>.
*   **Russia**: Seen as a supporting actor in the new Cold War between China and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04"></a>. Russia is a key ally of Iran, which is poised to lead a war against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04"></a>.
*   **Taiwan**: Strategically important due to its semiconductor industry and its geographic position, which could allow control of vital sea access for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:58"></a>. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and intends to "reunify" it, possibly by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47"></a>. The US has an agreement to support Taiwan if China invades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25"></a>.
*   **Israel**: Central to God's prophetic clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:31"></a>. Israel is currently in a fragile state, dependent on allies like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:55"></a>. Its recent gas discoveries in the Mediterranean Sea are significant, as they could supply Europe and reduce reliance on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:14"></a>.

## The Tribulation and its Phases
The concept of tribulation comes from Daniel's prophecy of 70 weeks, where the last "week" (seven years) is the period of Great Tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:46"></a>.
*   **First Half (3.5 years)**: A period of "relative peace" initiated by a peace agreement, potentially involving Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:54"></a>. This period will see the rise of the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15"></a>.
*   **Second Half (3.5 years)**: Begins when Satan falls to Earth and the Antichrist breaks the peace covenant with Israel, entering the Holy of Holies in the rebuilt Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:12"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:14"></a>. This marks the "Abomination of Desolation" spoken of by Daniel and Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09"></a>.

### The Antichrist and False Prophet
*   **The Antichrist**: A human leader, possibly from a renewed Roman Empire or a coalition of nations, who will be possessed by demonic forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:54"></a>. He will perform signs and wonders and demand to be worshipped as God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:49"></a>. He will deny the father and the son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21"></a>.
*   **The False Prophet**: A religious leader who will compel humanity to worship the Antichrist's image and accept the Mark of the Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:15"></a>.

### The Mark of the Beast
Described as a "mark" or "seal" that will be required to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:30"></a>. It is literally described as a piercing or tattoo that marks the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:09"></a>. Refusal to take the mark will result in condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:58"></a>. The mark also denies Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:35"></a>. The internet system (www) is seen by some as representing the 666 mentioned in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:59"></a>.

### Rebuilding the Third Temple
For end-times prophecies to unfold, the Third Temple must be rebuilt in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:20"></a>. This is a highly sensitive geopolitical issue due to the presence of Islamic holy sites (Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque) on the Temple Mount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:30"></a>. Some interpretations suggest the Temple will be built in the northern part of Mount Moriah, avoiding conflict with existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:04"></a>. Rituals, such as the sacrifice of a completely red heifer, are being prepared by Jewish priestly families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:57"></a>.

### Gog and Magog War
Ezekiel 38 describes a future war led by Gog, the leader of Magog (identified as Russia), against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:10"></a>. Allies include Iran (Persia), Turkey, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:24"></a>. This war is expected to cause global chaos, setting the stage for a peace agreement that will usher in the Antichrist's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:20"></a>.

## New World Order and Global Control
Various initiatives are seen as laying the groundwork for a global government and increased societal control:
*   **Agenda 2030**: A UN initiative promoting sustainability and drastic changes in consumption patterns and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:50"></a>. It is viewed as an ideological imposition that aligns with the "Great Reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:51"></a>.
*   **Digital Currency**: The move towards Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is seen as a tool for absolute government control over financial transactions, eliminating anonymity and allowing authorities to monitor and restrict spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00"></a>. China's digital yuan served as a test case for this type of financial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:08"></a>.
*   **Social Credit System**: Modeled after China's system, this would evaluate citizens based on their behavior and compliance, affecting their ability to buy, finance, or even travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:39"></a>.
*   **Population Reduction**: Mentioned in the Georgia Guidestones (a monument recently demolished), this is a controversial idea debated by global elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00"></a>.
*   **One World Religion**: Efforts towards religious dialogue and tolerance, such as those promoted by Pope Francis, are seen as paving the way for a syncretistic, unified global religion that may eventually suppress traditional faiths, especially Judeo-Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:56"></a>.

## The Church and Faith in the End Times
*   **Cooling of Faith**: As prophesied by Jesus, the love of many will grow cold, and faith will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:26"></a>. This decline in spiritual conviction weakens resistance to the Antichrist's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:57"></a>.
*   **Rapture**: The belief that true believers will be "raptured" or taken from the Earth before or during the Tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06"></a>. Different [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | interpretations of eschatology and end times]] exist regarding the timing of the rapture (pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, post-tribulation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:24"></a>.
*   **Purpose of Tribulation**: The Tribulation is primarily meant to test the "inhabitants of the Earth" (those deeply rooted in worldly matters) and to bring Israel to repentance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:57"></a>.

## The Return of Jesus and Final Victory
*   **The Lamb as Judge**: Contrary to some assumptions, Jesus Christ, depicted as the Lamb who was slain, is the one who opens the seals of judgment in Revelation. He is the "Lion of the Tribe of Judah" and the King of Kings, who will judge and conquer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55"></a>.
*   **Armageddon**: The final battle where Christ descends with the Church to defeat the forces of the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00"></a>.
*   **Wedding of the Lamb**: A symbolic representation of Christ receiving His redeemed people (the Church) in heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00"></a>. This aligns with the Jewish wedding custom where the groom prepares a home for his bride and returns unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:05"></a>.

[[Prophetic visions and endtimes prophecy | Prophetic visions and endtimes prophecy]] are seen not as a cause for despair but as a call for preparation and evangelism, knowing that God has a plan for humanity's redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20"></a>.

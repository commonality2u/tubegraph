The topic of the first and second comings of Christ is central to Christian theology, encompassing Christ's eternal nature, his role in creation, his incarnation, his purpose on Earth, and his promised return to establish his kingdom and judge the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:07">[07:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:22">[07:48:22]</a>.

## The Eternal Christ
Before his incarnation, Christ was already eternal God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:01">[08:42:01]</a>. He is referred to as the Word or the Logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:06">[08:45:06]</a>, which signifies the very essence of God in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:40">[09:02:40]</a>. The Bible states that all things were made through him, confirming his role as creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:12">[09:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:34">[16:58:34]</a>.

### The Trinity
The concept of the Trinity is one of Christianity's mysteries, understanding God as three persons—Father, Son (Christ), and Holy Spirit—yet they are one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:15">[08:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:43">[08:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:34">[10:37:34]</a>. This concept is supported by passages like Genesis 1, where God uses plural forms like "Let us make man in our image and likeness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:32">[09:57:32]</a>.

The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit acted together in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:03">[15:43:03]</a>. When God the Father gave the command "Let there be light," it was the Word (Jesus) who executed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:04">[15:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:01">[15:26:01]</a>. The Spirit of God was also active, standing over the waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:07">[15:37:07]</a>.

### Pre-Incarnate Appearances in the Old Testament
Christ appeared in the Old Testament, often as the "angel of the Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:04">[11:16:04]</a>. This "angel" is distinct from created angels because he receives adoration and does not refuse it, unlike created angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:38">[11:51:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:32">[12:57:32]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Moses and the Burning Bush** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:09">[11:59:09]</a>: The Lord Jesus is speaking to Moses from the bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:23">[12:18:23]</a>.
*   **Joshua before Jericho** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:30">[12:26:30]</a>: Joshua encounters the "captain of the armies of the Most High," who commands him to remove his sandals because the place is holy, similar to the encounter with Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:10">[12:43:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:48">[12:47:48]</a>.
*   **Abraham and the Three Visitors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:05">[22:23:05]</a>: Three beings appear to Abraham, two angels and the third being the angel of the Lord, who is Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:08">[22:26:08]</a>.

## The First Coming of Christ
The incarnation of Christ was not a reaction to man's sin but was eternally planned by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:21">[17:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:04">[17:47:04]</a>. God, being omniscient, knew humanity would fall and pre-planned the Redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:54">[18:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:16">[19:59:16]</a>. This is evidenced by Revelation 13:8, which refers to "the Lamb that was slain since the foundation of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:02">[19:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:02">[19:15:02]</a>. This highlights God's incomprehensible and unconditional love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:30">[20:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:30">[20:51:30]</a>.

### Prophecies and Their Fulfillment
The entire Old Testament points to Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:08">[26:55:08]</a>. There are thousands of prophecies, types, characters, and even sacrificed animals that foreshadowed Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:40">[27:57:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:18">[28:02:18]</a>. Jesus himself stated that the scriptures "testify of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:20">[28:15:20]</a>.

*   **First Prophecy of the Messiah:** Genesis 3:15 contains the first prophecy, where God speaks of the descendant of the woman stepping on the serpent's head, signifying Christ's victory over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:44">[28:28:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:47">[28:48:47]</a>.
*   **Birthplace in Bethlehem:** The prophet Micah (5:2) foretold that the ruler of Israel would come from Bethlehem Ephrathah, despite its small size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:58:05">[37:58:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:14">[38:08:14]</a>. Caesar Augustus's census forced Joseph and Mary to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, ensuring this prophecy's fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:47">[40:57:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:03:16">[42:03:16]</a>.
*   **Virgin Birth:** Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that a virgin would conceive and bear a son named Immanuel (God with us) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:35">[02:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. This was essential for Jesus to be born without sin, as sin is transmitted through the human father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:18">[02:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

### Purpose of the First Coming: Salvation and Redemption
Jesus's primary purpose in his [[events_surrounding_the_birth_and_crucifixion_of_jesus | first coming]] was to save humanity from sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. He came to live a holy life, without sin, to become a perfect sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:43">[44:23:43]</a>. God, who abhors sin but loves the sinner, sent his Son to overcome what Satan did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:08">[32:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:08">[32:12:08]</a>. Through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and through one man (Jesus), righteousness came to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:24">[45:51:24]</a>.

### Crucifixion as Sacrifice
Jesus's death was prophesied and meticulously planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. He died as the Paschal Lamb during the Easter festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. His crucifixion happened at 9 AM, the time of the morning sacrifice, and he died at 3 PM, the time of the evening sacrifice, indicating his fulfillment of the sacrificial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

His passion included elements of the Roman Saturnalia festival, where a condemned slave was paraded as king before being killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. This highlights Jesus, the King of the Universe, dying like a condemned slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. His death was not due to incompetence or weakness but a voluntary surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. This sacrifice allows for the forgiveness of sins, as the blood of animals only "covered" sins, while Jesus's blood destroys them, making believers "whiter than snow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

## The Second Coming of Christ
The story of Jesus does not end with his death and resurrection; he promised he would return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. This second coming is a significant part of Christian eschatology. [[christian_eschatology_and_prophecy | Christian eschatology and prophecy]]

### Prophecies and Signs
The Bible dedicates about 40% of its content to prophetic aspects, and many apostles, including Paul and John, extensively discuss the second coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a>. Jesus himself gave signs of his return in the "Prophetic Sermon" (Matthew 24-25), mentioning natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and apostasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a>.

Specific prophecies indicating the end times include:
*   **The Return of Israel to Their Land:** Ezekiel 36 states that God would bring the people of Israel back from all nations to their land, and they would never leave again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>. This was fulfilled in 1948 with the establishment of modern Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:11">[01:43:11]</a>.
*   **The Valley of Dry Bones:** Ezekiel 37's vision of dry bones coming to life is seen as a prophecy of the Holocaust and Israel's subsequent re-establishment as a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:05">[01:41:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.
*   **The Dead Sea Becoming Fresh:** Ezekiel also prophesied that the Dead Sea would have fresh water and fish, with the northern part becoming fresh while the southern part remains salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>. This is seen in the geological changes and appearance of fresh water craters in the northern part of the Dead Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>.
*   **Gog and Magog War:** Ezekiel 38 describes nations like Russia (Magog), Iran (Persia), and Turkey coming against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. This is a future event where God himself will give Israel an overwhelming victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>.
*   **Global Control and Technology:** The development of chips for human implantation (like Neuralink) and the rise of global control systems (like Elon Musk's super-app X) are seen as precursors to the "mark of the beast" (666) prophesied in Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:33">[01:50:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. The number 666 can be interpreted as "WAV vav vav" (www) in Hebrew, linking it to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.

### The Rapture
The next significant event is the rapture of the church, which occurs before the second coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>. During the rapture, the dead in Christ will be resurrected, and living believers will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:24">[01:48:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. This event is invisible to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>.

### The Great Tribulation
Between the rapture and the second coming, there will be a seven-year period known as the Great Tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>. This will be a time of intense global distress, dominated by the antichrist and a false prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:24">[01:49:24]</a>. The antichrist is a political leader, while the false prophet is a powerful religious leader who will compel worship of the beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. The world is preparing for a global agenda of control, potentially leading to a loss of democracy, which aligns with the conditions for the antichrist's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>.

### The Millennium
After the Tribulation, Jesus will descend with the church to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:38">[01:48:38]</a>, and there will be a 1,000-year period known as the Millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:21">[02:17:21]</a>. This is described as a "Golden Age" where Christ will be physically present and Satan will be imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:24">[02:17:24]</a>. During this time:
*   Sin will be greatly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:39">[02:17:39]</a>.
*   There will be great prosperity and bountiful harvests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:48">[02:17:48]</a>.
*   No plagues or corruption will exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>.
*   Saints with glorified bodies will govern with Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:49">[02:18:49]</a>.
*   Life expectancy will increase significantly, with those dying at 100 years old considered young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>.

At the end of the 1,000 years, Satan will be released for a short time to seduce nations, and some will side with him, leading to a final conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>.

### Final Judgment
After the Millennium and the final conflict, Christ will come again to end the conflict and bring about the final judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:37">[02:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. In his first coming, Jesus was the Lamb who died for sins; in his second, he will be the Lion who judges the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[02:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:41">[02:03:41]</a>. Those who accepted him will experience joy in his presence eternally, while those who did not will be separated from God in the Lake of Fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:14">[02:05:14]</a>.

The second coming is not something to be feared by believers but rather "the Blessed Hope," as it signifies the ultimate reunion of the bride (the Church) with the groom (Christ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>.

The [[Igor Guimarães]] character known as the Josias puppet was created as a new comedic persona for the "Pânico" program [00:46:29]. The initial concept for the character arose from [[Morgado]] and [[Beth Moreno]], a writer for the show, who needed a new character for [[Igor Guimarães]] to perform [00:46:32], as he was already performing other characters [00:46:41].

[[Igor Guimarães]] proposed embodying the character himself, stating, "I can make a doll" and "don't even put on make up I'm a doll" [00:48:00]. The Josias puppet gained significant popularity because it combined seemingly contradictory elements of humor, mixing "bread with the wrong" [00:49:18]. This included heavy, absurd humor, such as speaking from a prison voice or mentioning organ theft, delivered through a puppet [00:49:27]. This unique style resonated with a younger audience that was leaning towards lighter humor, yet found the puppet's dark comedy enchanting [00:49:47].

## Characteristics and Impact
*   **Performance:** The Josias puppet is characterized by its interaction with the audience, including singing songs [00:26:34].
*   **Preparation:** Behind the scenes, the character involves makeup, shine, and moisturizer [00:26:40].
*   **Themed Environment:** The character even has a dedicated "room of the doll Josias" in [[Igor Guimarães]]'s house [00:17:09].
*   **Influence on Humor:** The Josias puppet's success at "Pânico" highlighted a demand for sketch characters in Brazilian television, a format that was becoming less common [00:50:04]. [[Igor Guimarães]] believes that this type of humor, which defies traditional boundaries, is still relevant and valued by audiences [00:50:31].

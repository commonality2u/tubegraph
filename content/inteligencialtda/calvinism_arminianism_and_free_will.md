The [[christian_denominations_and_their_differences | Protestant Reformation]], which occurred in the 16th century, specifically beginning in 1517, led to the development of two primary theological lines concerning [[soteriology_and_theological_interpretations | salvation]]: Calvinism and Arminianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. These two lines confronted each other in a debate at the Synod of Dort in 1618-1619 in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Calvinism

Calvinism, rooted in the teachings of [[role_of_key_figures_like_martin_luther_and_john_calvin_in_the_reformation | John Calvin]], defines [[doctrine_of_predestination_and_election | salvation]] based on five core points:
1.  **Total Depravity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>: This doctrine asserts that humanity, after the Fall, is entirely corrupted in every aspect – reason, emotion, and volition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Every human being is born a sinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The problem of evil originates from within the human heart, not from external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For example, power does not corrupt, but rather reveals the corruption already present within a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Essentially, humanity is bad unless [[concepts_of_sin_and_salvation_in_christianity | God]] transforms the heart's inclination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Unconditional Election** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>: Calvinism posits that God chooses humanity, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Humanity's love for God is a response to God's prior love for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
3.  **Limited Atonement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>: This means Christ's work on the cross was effective; He died to *actually* save His church, not just to make salvation possible for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
4.  **Irresistible Grace (Effective Vocation)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>: When God calls, He effectively calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. "My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Those truly called will respond.
5.  **Perseverance of the Saints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>: A person who has been truly saved has their salvation guaranteed by God, and cannot lose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. A child of God remains a child of God, even if they err <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Sin incurs disciplinary treatment from God, but does not revoke their status as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Calvinism emphasizes God's [[doctrine_of_predestination_and_election | sovereignty]] in salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Salvation is seen as a work planned by God, executed by God, and consummated by God, ensuring all glory goes to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. It is not something found by man, but rather God finding man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. Human beings are dead in their crimes and sins before conversion, implying an inability to choose salvation on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

While God is sovereign, man is still 100% responsible for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>. The decision to repent and believe lies with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.# Calvinism, Arminianism, and Free Will

Salvation is seen as a work planned by God, executed by God, and consummated by God, ensuring all glory goes to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

## Arminianism

[[arminianism_vs_calvinism_debate | Arminianism]], originating from Jacobus Arminius, holds different views:
*   **Human Choice in Salvation**: Arminianism suggests that humanity is not totally depraved and therefore has the [[role_of_free_will_in_salvation_theology | free will]] to choose God and salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>.
*   **Conditional Election**: God's election is conditioned upon man's foreseen faith.
*   **Unlimited Atonement**: Christ's death made salvation possible for everyone, but it is only actualized for those who believe.
*   **Resistible Grace**: God's grace can be resisted by human free will.
*   **Conditional Perseverance**: Salvation can be lost if a believer does not persevere in faith.

In [[arminianism_vs_calvinism_debate | Arminianism]], the individual holds the "reins in hand" regarding their salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

## Free Will vs. Free Agency

The core of the [[arminianism_vs_calvinism_debate | Calvinism-Arminianism debate]] centers on the concept of [[role_of_free_will_in_salvation_theology | free will]]:
*   **Calvinist View**: Calvinism does not believe in "free will" in the sense that a human being, after the Fall, has the power to choose *not to sin* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. Only Adam, before sin, possessed this ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. However, Calvinism does believe in "free agency," meaning individuals can make daily choices like deciding what to wear or which path to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
*   **Arminian View**: Arminianism contends that individuals possess the ability to choose not to sin and to accept or reject salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.

From a biblical perspective, man is considered "dead" spiritually, incapable of initiating a response to God without divine intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Salvation, therefore, is a completely divine work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

## Divine Foreknowledge and Human Responsibility

A common question is why God allows sin if He knows everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:20">[02:11:20]</a>. The answer lies in the distinction between divine foreknowledge and divine determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40">[02:24:40]</a>.
*   **God's Omniscience**: God is omniscient and knows the future; He is never surprised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>. The plan of redemption, for instance, precedes the Fall, as the Lamb was slain "before the foundation of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>.
*   **Human Responsibility**: God's foreknowledge does not mean He *determined* humanity to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Man is fully responsible for their rebellion against God and disobedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. God desires man to repent and believe, but He also gives repentance for life and saving faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>. The decision is the individual's, but it is God who works in them to incline their heart toward Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>. No one can claim they were not chosen if they desired salvation, as God takes away spiritual "earplugs" and "blindfolds" when a heart inclines towards Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>.

In summary, the [[arminianism_vs_calvinism_debate | Calvinism vs. Arminianism debate]] boils down to differing views on God's sovereignty and humanity's freedom in the process of salvation. Calvinism emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty and divine initiation in salvation, while Arminianism emphasizes human free will and the individual's choice to accept or reject God's grace.

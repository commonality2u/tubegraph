[[Islamic practices and beliefs | Islamic practices and beliefs]] and history are deeply intertwined, influencing not only religious observance but also social, political, and economic aspects of life.

## Core Tenets and Beliefs

The foundational text of [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] is the Quran, which literally means "that which heals" or "the book to be read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. The first divine order revealed in the Quran is "read," emphasizing the pursuit of knowledge as the initial step towards faith and understanding God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:39">[03:17:39]</a>. [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] promotes conviction derived from knowledge, not mere aesthetic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:50">[03:20:50]</a>. This conviction enables adherence to religious practices, even when they require effort, such as waking up for early morning prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:52">[03:31:52]</a>.

God, in the Islamic view, is the absolute Creator, eternal, and without beginning or end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>. This means God neither generates nor is generated, having no children, partners, father, mother, or descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. All beings and entities, including prophets and angels, are considered His creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>.

The Quran contains three main themes:
*   The [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | history of previous peoples]], both successful and unsuccessful, serving as lessons for humanity to avoid past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:02">[04:51:02]</a>.
*   Faith and belief in one God (monotheism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:02">[04:59:02]</a>.
*   Laws and rules that guide human behavior and societal organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:50">[05:17:50]</a>.

### Communication and Good Words
The traditional Arabic greeting "Salamaleico" (Assalamu Alaikum) means "May the peace of God be with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. The reciprocal response is "Aleikum Salam" (Wa Alaikum Assalam), meaning "And with you too, the peace of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This exchange is a supplication, sharing prayers for peace, and is seen as a blessed start to any conversation, as positive words are believed to bear fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Speaking good words, supplications, words of motivation, or praise is encouraged, as words are considered vibrations and energy that leave a lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This concept is likened to experiments showing water crystals forming beautiful symmetrical patterns when exposed to positive words, versus chaotic ones with negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

Muslims are taught to invoke God's blessing by saying "Bismillah" (In the Name of God) before performing daily actions, from eating and drinking to dressing and leaving the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This practice is believed to invoke God's protection and blessing upon every act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

## Prophet Muhammad's Life and Role

Prophet Muhammad, whose name means "the praised one" or "the one who is praised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, was born in Mecca (present-day Saudi Arabia) around 570 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. He lived as an ordinary person until the age of 40, working as a merchant for a businesswoman, who was 15 years his senior and later became his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. They had six children, two boys who died as infants, and four girls who grew to adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

At 40, during spiritual retreats, he received the first revelation of the Quran through the Angel Gabriel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Muhammad was illiterate, and the Quran was revealed orally over 23 years, with his companions acting as scribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This oral transmission and later compilation by his companions, with his corrections, ensured its preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

Prophets, including Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, Abraham, and others, are seen as teachers sent by God to guide humanity and demonstrate how to apply divine scriptures in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. They serve as role models, teaching how to handle various situations, such as managing anger or dealing with injustice, in alignment with God's teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### The Migration (Hijra) and Islamic Calendar
Initially, Muhammad faced persecution in Mecca due to his call for monotheism, which challenged the polytheistic practices and commercial control of the Meccan elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. In 622 CE, at God's command, he migrated to Medina, about 450 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. This migration, known as the Hijra, marks the year zero of the Islamic calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. In Medina, the Prophet was accepted as a ruler, leading to the establishment of an Islamic government and an organized Muslim community with its own army and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. This transition from a persecuted group to a sovereign state was a crucial turning point for [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Islamic Governance and Law (Sharia)

Islamic law, or Sharia, is viewed as a comprehensive code of life that governs all aspects of human existence, including political, economic, educational, family, and social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It does not separate the secular from the spiritual; instead, it integrates ethics, spirituality, and faith into all behaviors and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. For example, honesty and not deceiving others are religious precepts that apply in politics, business, and family life alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This means a Muslim's values and behavior should remain consistent whether inside or outside a mosque, as a spouse, parent, president, or worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

While Sharia provides general rules, it also allows for adaptation to new technologies and situations through unchanging ethical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For instance, therapeutic cloning for organ regeneration is permitted, but human cloning is forbidden due to complex issues of lineage and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Economic Principles
[[cultural_and_historical_influences_on_economics | Islamic economic principles]] emphasize collective well-being over individual gain. Free trade is permitted, but usury (interest) is prohibited because it benefits individuals at the expense of the collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This means Muslims are restricted from investing in financial systems that rely on interest or in companies dealing in prohibited substances like alcohol or pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Social Responsibility and Charity
A core practice is "Zakat," an annual charitable payment of 2.5% of a Muslim's net profit to the poor and needy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This system fosters social responsibility, encouraging individuals to care for their neighbors and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The Prophet Muhammad stated that "it is not completely faithful to a person who sleeps satisfied and his hungry neighbor and he knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>. This practice promotes social inclusion and reduces feelings of resentment between the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:53">[02:19:53]</a>.

### Marriage and Family
In [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]], marriage is a partnership based on mutual agreement and respect, rather than arranged marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>. Physical contact before the marriage contract is prohibited, emphasizing the importance of knowing a person's character, values, and family before physical intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. This approach aims to prevent regrets stemming from decisions based solely on passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Both men and women have distinct roles and responsibilities within the family and society, but neither is superior to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The husband's primary role is to support and protect the family emotionally and materially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:49">[01:53:49]</a>. The wife's primary role is as an educator, guiding children and often even the husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">[01:54:53]</a>. Women are not forced to work but have the right to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">[01:55:12]</a>. Decisions in marriage should be made through mutual agreement, as both partners are seen as essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:19">[01:57:19]</a>.

## Social and Cultural Practices

### Dietary Laws (Halal)
[[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic dietary laws]] prohibit the consumption of pork and all its derivatives, as it is considered harmful to human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. Alcoholic beverages are also forbidden, as they are seen as the "mother of all evils," contributing to accidents, domestic violence, and other social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>. This prohibition extends to avoiding any apology or encouragement of alcohol consumption, including social drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Clothing
[[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic clothing guidelines]] dictate that both men and women should avoid tight or transparent clothes that define the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Men must cover from the navel to the knee, including during sports. Women must cover their entire body except for the face and hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>. These rules are for the preservation of family, fidelity, and to prevent temptation, applying equally to both genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### Prayer and Fasting
Muslims perform five daily prayers at specific times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. These prayers involve ritualistic movements, including standing, bowing, and prostrating (placing the forehead and nose on the ground) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:56">[03:15:56]</a>. Prostration symbolizes humility and submission to God, placing the highest part of the body (forehead, associated with pride) below the lowest (the ground) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:40">[03:18:40]</a>. Prayers are performed in Arabic to maintain the originality of God's word, though personal supplications can be in any language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

The month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, requires fasting from dawn until sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This practice, one of the five pillars of [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]], serves spiritual, mental, physical, and social functions, allowing individuals to feel the hunger of the needy and fostering empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.

## Historical Context and Expansion

[[geopolitics_and_religion_relationship | Geopolitics and religion relationship]] played a significant role in the initial expansion of [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]]. The Arabian Peninsula before [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] was characterized by tribal conflicts and influence from major powers like the Persian and Byzantine Empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. The message of [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] emphasized freedom from subjugation and submission to any entity other than God, advocating for justice and leadership as service to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.

Following the Prophet Muhammad's death, [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic expansion]] continued, with invitations sent to other empires for alliances or to accept the Islamic message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. This led to a significant expansion under leaders like Omar, reaching regions like the Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. Islamic governance introduced public administration concepts still used today, such as institutions for animal welfare, orphanages, and aid for the needy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

Historically, Jews, Christians, and Muslims coexisted peacefully in regions like Jerusalem under Islamic rule for centuries, demonstrating that peace is possible when there is respect and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Understanding Misconceptions

### [[Islamic extremism and Middle Eastern conflicts | Islamic Extremism and Middle Eastern Conflicts]]
Terrorism is not inherent to [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] or any religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:40">[03:00:40]</a>. Terrorists are fanatics who justify atrocities with ideology, whether religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:59">[03:01:59]</a>. Media often wrongly associates [[islamic_extremism_and_middle_eastern_conflicts | terrorism with Islam]] to attack the religion itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:40">[03:02:40]</a>.

Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Palestinian perspective views Zionists as colonizers who took their land and established Israel in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Palestinians, including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and atheists, lost their country and homes in this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>. This ongoing conflict is seen as a result of injustice, as human nature does not accept injustice indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:55">[02:52:55]</a>.

### Sunni and Shia Divisions
The division between Sunni and Shia Muslims originated from a political disagreement over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:52">[02:56:52]</a>. Shias believe leadership should have remained within the Prophet's family, while Sunnis (the majority, 85%) believe it should go to the most capable individual, regardless of lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:35">[02:57:35]</a>. This fundamental difference led to historical conflicts, but coexistence is possible through dialogue and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:16">[02:59:16]</a>.

## [[Cultural and societal influences on spirituality | Cultural and Societal Influences on Spirituality]]

[[cultural_and_societal_influences_on_spirituality | Culture influences the practices of Islam]], but core tenets remain universal. While Arabic is preserved for prayers and Quranic recitation, other aspects like clothing can adapt to local climates (e.g., lightweight fabrics for hot regions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The traditional head covering worn by Arab men, for instance, serves practical purposes like protection from sandstorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:20">[03:25:20]</a>.

In [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]], specific hygiene practices are outlined, such as using the left hand for personal cleansing and the right hand for eating and greeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:13">[03:27:13]</a>. These rules are part of the comprehensive code of life, designed for health and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:41">[03:27:41]</a>.

### The Role of a Sheikh
The term "Sheikh" in Arabic means "elderly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Historically, tribal leaders were often the eldest members, revered for their experience and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Later, the title evolved to include individuals, even young ones, who deeply studied the Quran and returned to guide their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. A Sheikh acts as a guide, providing insight from the Quran on various matters, from politics to scientific advancements like cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Interfaith Understanding and [[History and significance of religious figures and texts across different faiths | Shared Figures]]

[[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | Islam recognizes Abrahamic prophets]] like Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad as messengers of the same God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Muslims believe that God sent 124,000 prophets throughout human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. All prophets are considered equal in importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The Quran mentions Jesus 25 times, more than Prophet Muhammad himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

Muslims believe Jesus did not die on the cross but was raptured into heaven at 33 years old, and he will return as a sign of the end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This belief contrasts with the Christian crucifixion narrative, with an interpretation suggesting God placed Jesus's likeness on Judas Iscariot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

The Quran does not view Jews, Christians, and Muslims as separate religions but as different stages or "updates" of the same monotheistic faith revealed by the same God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:51">[03:39:51]</a>. Therefore, a Muslim man can marry a Christian or Jewish woman, as long as she is a monotheistic practitioner, and he is obligated to guarantee her religious freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Conversely, a Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man because he is obligated to ensure the religious freedom of his wife, and a non-Muslim husband would not be bound by the same obligation to uphold his wife's Islamic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

Muslims are descendants of Ishmael, while Jews are descendants of Isaac; however, adherence to [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] is based on conviction and knowledge, not ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. The term "Muslim" means "one who surrenders totally and voluntarily to the one God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

The Islamic lunar calendar, based on lunar cycles, has 12 months, usually 29 or 30 days, causing it to shift approximately 10 days earlier each year compared to the Gregorian calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>.

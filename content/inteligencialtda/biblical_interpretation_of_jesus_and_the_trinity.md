The Christian faith understands God as a Trinity, comprising three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. These three are considered one God, eternally existing and working in complete synergy, yet maintaining their individual personalities [00:08:19]. This concept is described as a mystery that cannot be fully understood in all its depth [00:08:24], yet is affirmed through biblical texts. An analogy often used to illustrate the Trinity is water, which can exist in solid, liquid, and gaseous states while remaining H2O, representing different manifestations of the same essence [01:04:42].

## Jesus's Pre-existence and Divinity

According to biblical interpretation, Jesus Christ, as God the Son, eternally existed with God the Father and the Holy Spirit [00:10:09]. He was never created [00:10:09] and is considered the "Word" or "Logos" [00:08:45], which is the very essence of God and the active force in creation [00:09:03].

The Gospel of John states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" [00:08:47]. All things were made through Him, and nothing was made without Him [00:09:09]. God the Father is viewed as the architect who conceived creation, while the Word (Jesus) executed it, and the Holy Spirit supervised the process [00:09:17].

During creation, the term "God" (Elohim) is used in a plural form, and God says, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," indicating the involvement of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit [00:09:36]. Jesus is described as the "exact manifestation of God" and the "exact expression of his being" [01:02:28]. When asked to show the Father, Jesus responded, "Whoever sees me sees the Father... I and the Father are one" [01:04:06].

## Jesus in the Old Testament

Before His incarnation, Jesus was active, often appearing as a "messenger of Yahweh," translated in the Portuguese Bible as the "angel of the Lord" [01:11:04]. This "angel of the Lord" is distinct from created angels, as He receives worship, unlike created angels who refuse it [01:11:27].

Examples of Jesus's pre-incarnate appearances include:
*   **The Burning Bush**: When Moses encountered God in the burning bush, it was the Lord Jesus speaking to him [01:11:59].
*   **Joshua before Jericho**: Joshua encountered a figure with a drawn sword who identified Himself as the "captain of the armies of the Most High" and commanded Joshua to remove his sandals because the place was holy, mirroring the encounter with Moses [01:12:21].

The entire [[role_of_jesus_in_the_old_testament | Old Testament]] is seen as pointing to Jesus through types, characters, and even sacrificed animals [02:55:00]. Prophecies, such as the one in Genesis 3:15, speak of the Messiah crushing the serpent's head, which is understood as Jesus's victory over the devil through His death and resurrection [02:28:29].

## The Incarnation and its Purpose

Jesus's incarnation was not a reactive measure to humanity's sin, but rather an eternal plan of God [01:17:21]. The Bible speaks of the "Lamb that was slain since the foundation of the world," indicating that Jesus's sacrifice was foreseen and decided in eternity [01:19:33]. God's love, which is His very nature, is the explanation for this plan [02:01:16].

The virgin birth of Jesus was crucial because sin is transmitted through man, not woman [02:06:17]. As Adam transmitted sin, Jesus needed to be born without a human father to be sinless and thus a perfect sacrifice [02:06:22].

Jesus's coming to Earth was to save humanity from sin [02:14:00]. His teachings were thousands of years ahead of their time, transforming human history and shaping Western culture [02:14:04]. He challenged the rigid, stereotypical laws of His era by emphasizing a change of heart and unconditional love, exemplified by His healing of lepers and acceptance of outcasts [02:29:50]. His ultimate objective was to live a holy life to become a perfect sacrifice [02:22:00].

Jesus's death was necessary for salvation [02:40:02]. It was not the fault of the Jews or Romans, but rather a voluntary act of surrender for the sins of humanity [02:12:35]. His death on Passover, as the Paschal Lamb, and the timing of His crucifixion aligned perfectly with the ancient sacrificial rituals, emphasizing His role as the ultimate sacrifice [02:47:41].

## The Second Coming of Christ

Jesus's story does not end with His death and resurrection; He promised to return [02:01:57]. The second coming is a central theme in the Bible, spoken of by Jesus Himself in the "Prophetic Sermon" (Matthew 24:2) and by many apostles [02:02:10]. While no one knows the exact day or hour [02:26:33], Jesus instructed believers to observe the "times and seasons" through various signs [02:26:47].

The second coming is distinct from the rapture of the church, where believers meet the Lord in the air [02:48:05], whereas the second coming involves Jesus descending to Earth for all eyes to see [02:48:38]. Between these two events lies the Great [[tribulation_and_biblical_prophecy | Tribulation]], a period dominated by the Antichrist and the false prophet, forming a "Satanic Trinity" [02:48:50].

At His second coming, Jesus will act as a judge, unlike His first coming as the Lamb of God [03:03:34]. He will establish judgment and eternal rule, bringing an end to suffering and ushering in a millennium of peace [03:04:11]. The world is seen as preparing for this return, with numerous signs, such as natural catastrophes and technological advancements, converging in recent times [03:35:51].

## Conclusion

Jesus is presented as the eternal, uncreated God the Son, central to creation and redemption. His first coming provided salvation through sacrifice, fulfilling ancient prophecies. His promised second coming will bring judgment and establish His eternal kingdom, marking the culmination of God's redemptive plan for humanity.

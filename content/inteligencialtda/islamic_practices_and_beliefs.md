## Introduction to Islam
Islam, as a religion, is a code of life encompassing comprehensive rules for all aspects of human existence, including ethics, spirituality, and societal roles, without separating the secular from the heavenly [01:10:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">01:10:59</a>), [01:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">01:15:00</a>). Its core principle is the total and voluntary surrender to the one God [01:16:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">01:16:16</a>), [03:49:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">03:49:09</a>).

[[Faith and spirituality discussions | Faith]] and conviction are paramount in Islam, as belief is rooted in knowledge [03:22:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:25">03:22:25</a>). The first divine order revealed in the Quran was to "read" or "acquire knowledge" [03:19:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:52">03:19:52</a>), emphasizing that knowledge is the initial step to reaching God and the pinnacle of [[Spirituality and personal beliefs | faith]] [03:19:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:52">03:19:52</a>).

### The Power of Words and Intentions
Words are considered vibrations and energy in Islam [05:06:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:06">05:06:06</a>). Speaking well or offering supplications for others generates positive vibrations and leaves a good impression [04:17:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:17">04:17:17</a>), [05:18:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:18">05:18:18</a>). Conversely, wishing harm or speaking negatively poisons oneself internally [04:55:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">04:55:00</a>). Saying "In the Name of God" (Bismillah) before daily activities invokes divine blessing and protection [06:27:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">06:27:00</a>).

## Core Beliefs
Islam is a monotheistic religion, believing in one God as the Creator and Sustainer of everything and everyone [04:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">04:06:00</a>), [04:47:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">04:47:47</a>). God is eternal, without beginning or end, and has no children, partners, wife, father, mother, or descendants [04:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:51">04:50:51</a>). All beings, including prophets like Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, Moses, David, Solomon, and Adam, are God's creatures [04:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:51">04:50:51</a>).

> [!NOTE] The word "Islam" means "Total and voluntary surrender to God the only one" [01:19:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">01:19:21</a>), [03:49:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">03:49:09</a>).

## The Quran and Prophets
The Quran is the holy book of Islam, revealed over 23 years [01:11:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">01:11:52</a>), [03:48:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">03:48:47</a>). It comprises three main themes:
1.  **History of previous peoples:** Lessons from successful and unsuccessful nations (e.g., Pharaoh, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham) [04:08:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:47">04:08:47</a>). This teaches humanity not to repeat past mistakes and to learn from the experiences of ancestors [04:37:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">04:37:37</a>).
2.  **[[Faith and spirituality discussions | Faith]] and belief in God:** Emphasizing monotheism and God's power as the Creator [04:39:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:59">04:39:59</a>).
3.  **Laws and rules:** Guidelines on what is permissible and forbidden [04:14:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:52">04:14:52</a>).

God sent 124,000 prophets throughout human history [05:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:12">05:12:12</a>). Prophets act as teachers and facilitators, showing how to apply divine scriptures in practice and how to deal with life's situations [04:22:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:22">04:22:22</a>), [04:34:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:34">04:34:34</a>).

### [[The life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad | Prophet Muhammad]]
Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca (present-day Saudi Arabia) around 570 CE [02:26:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">02:26:26</a>). His name, Muhammad, means "the praised one" [02:53:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:35">02:53:35</a>). He was illiterate, a merchant who worked for a businesswoman 15 years his senior, with whom he later had six children [02:46:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:42">02:46:42</a>). At 40, during spiritual retreats, he received the first revelation of the Quran from the Angel Gabriel [02:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">02:57:00</a>).

The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad gradually over 23 years, often in response to specific situations [03:48:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">03:48:47</a>), [03:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">03:57:00</a>). His companions, the scribes, wrote down the revelations as he narrated them [03:22:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">03:22:22</a>). He died at the age of 63 and is buried in Medina, having fulfilled his mission [03:26:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">03:26:26</a>).

### Jesus and Other Prophets in Islam
Islam recognizes Jesus as a messenger of God, born miraculously through the Angel Gabriel and God's word in Mary's womb [04:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:51">04:50:51</a>). Jesus is mentioned more times in the Quran than Prophet Muhammad [04:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:51">04:50:51</a>). Muslims believe Jesus did not die on the cross but was "raptured" or ascended into heaven at 33 years old, and will return as a sign of the end times, to establish justice and defeat the Antichrist [05:03:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">05:03:00</a>).

Other prophets mentioned include Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Joseph, David, and Solomon [04:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:51">04:50:51</a>). All prophets shared the same mission: to guide humanity [04:52:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:51">04:52:51</a>).

## Islamic Practices (Sharia)
The Islamic holy law, or Sharia, is a comprehensive code of life that provides general rules for everything, from daily routines to social and economic systems [01:45:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">01:45:51</a>). It encourages [[Spirituality and personal beliefs | spiritual]] elevation, self-control, and physical detox [03:47:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:33">03:47:33</a>).

### Daily Prayers (Salat)
Muslims perform five mandatory daily prayers at specific times throughout the day [03:09:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:55">03:09:55</a>). These prayers involve ritualistic movements and specific recitations from the Quran in Arabic, facing the Kaaba in Mecca [03:15:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:56">03:15:56</a>), [03:29:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:55">03:29:55</a>). The prayer movements symbolize humility and submission to God, with the forehead placed on the ground as a sign of recognizing God's superiority [03:40:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">03:40:40</a>).

> [!NOTE] The first prayer is usually between 5:00 and 6:00 AM, requiring an effort to leave comfort [03:11:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">03:11:10</a>).

### Charity (Zakat)
Zakat is an obligatory annual payment of 2.5% of net profit from the rich to the poor [01:16:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">01:16:39</a>). This fund is distributed by institutions or directly to the neediest individuals, especially closest family members and neighbors [01:18:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">01:18:18</a>). This practice strengthens social ties and fosters a sense of collective responsibility [01:19:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">01:19:01</a>).

### Fasting (Sawm)
Fasting is observed throughout the entire month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar [01:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">01:47:00</a>). From dawn until sunset, Muslims abstain from all food and liquid [01:47:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">01:47:07</a>). This practice serves social, spiritual, mental, and physical functions, allowing individuals to experience hunger and thus be more inclined to help the needy [01:47:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">01:47:30</a>).

### Dietary Laws (Halal and Haram)
Pork and its derivatives, as well as alcoholic beverages, are strictly prohibited in Islam because they are considered highly harmful to human health and well-being [01:25:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">01:25:04</a>). This prohibition extends to their consumption, sale, transport, and even apology or encouragement [01:28:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">01:28:30</a>), [01:28:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">01:28:50</a>). This rule has been in place since the beginning of humanity's creation [01:26:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">01:26:56</a>).

### Dress Code
Islamic dress code requires both men and women to wear loose, non-transparent clothing that does not define the body [01:30:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">01:30:05</a>). For men, the area from the navel to the knee must be covered [01:30:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">01:30:47</a>). Women must cover their entire body except for the face and hands [01:30:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56">01:30:56</a>). This is for the preservation of family, fidelity, and to prevent temptation [01:32:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">01:32:35</a>).

### Daily Hygiene
Muslims are guided to use their right hand for clean things like eating and greeting, and their left hand for personal hygiene after using the restroom [02:37:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:13">02:37:13</a>). This promotes hygiene and prevents contamination [02:37:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">02:37:54</a>).

## [[Differences and roles in Islamic marital and social structures | Islamic Marital and Social Structures]]
Islam emphasizes the equality of all human beings, regardless of gender or background [01:50:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:17">01:50:17</a>), [01:50:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:22">01:50:22</a>). While there is no inherent superiority, different roles and attributions are assigned for the organization of society and family [01:50:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:59">01:50:59</a>), [01:52:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">01:52:56</a>).

### Roles of Men and Women
In the family, the husband's primary role is that of captain, leader, protector, and financial supporter of the family [01:53:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">01:53:50</a>), [01:54:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:21">01:54:21</a>). The wife's primary role is the educator of the children and the basis of the family and society [01:54:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">01:54:53</a>). However, women have the right to work and are not forced to, and couples can mutually agree to exchange roles based on their strengths [01:55:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:12">01:55:12</a>), [01:55:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:49">01:55:49</a>).

Both men and women are subject to the same rules regarding honesty, fidelity, and avoiding illicit acts like drinking [01:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">01:33:00</a>).

### Marriage Process
Marriage in Islam emphasizes a rational and informed decision-making process, rather than being solely driven by passion or physical attraction [02:10:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">02:10:53</a>). Arranged marriages are not encouraged, as individuals are free to marry who they choose, provided there is a minimum convergence of values and ethics [02:00:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">02:00:36</a>), [02:01:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">02:01:03</a>). Respect is considered more important than love for a lasting relationship [02:01:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">02:01:46</a>).

The process involves:
1.  **Initial Meeting:** The man expresses interest in the woman and seeks permission from her family to meet her [02:07:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">02:07:03</a>).
2.  **Family Introduction:** Families meet to get to know each other, observing interactions and discussing values and expectations [02:07:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:40">02:07:40</a>).
3.  **No Physical Contact (Initially):** Physical contact, including kissing or holding hands, is prohibited until after the marriage contract is signed [02:03:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">02:03:30</a>), [02:20:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">02:20:01</a>). This ensures that the relationship develops based on character, values, and compatibility rather than superficial attraction [02:06:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">02:06:12</a>).
4.  **Marriage Contract:** This is the point where the couple becomes husband and wife, acquiring duties and rights [02:21:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">02:21:56</a>). This contract serves as both a civil and religious union [02:20:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">02:20:06</a>).

> [!WARNING] A Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man, while a Muslim man can marry a Muslim, Christian, or Jewish woman [02:27:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">02:27:52</a>), [02:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">02:57:00</a>). This is because the man is obligated by religion to guarantee his wife's right to religious freedom, even if she is non-Muslim [02:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">02:57:00</a>).

### Divorce
Divorce is permitted within Islam, but under strict rules and parameters to ensure no one is harmed [02:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">02:12:12</a>).

## [[Islamic history and cultural influence | Islamic History and Influence]]
The term "Sheikh" (or Sheik) in Arabic means "elderly" [01:32:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:58">01:32:58</a>). Historically, the leader of an Arab tribe was its oldest member, valued for experience and wisdom [01:39:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">01:39:58</a>). Later, the title extended to those who supported their clan financially and eventually to young scholars of the Quran who guided their communities [01:41:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">01:41:14</a>). In Islam, a Sheikh serves as a religious and political guide, advising on all aspects of life, including science and modern issues like cloning [01:47:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">01:47:48</a>).

> [!NOTE] Therapeutic cloning of organs is generally permitted, but human cloning is forbidden because it blurs identity and family lineage [01:59:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:33">01:59:33</a>).

### Early Expansion and the Islamic Calendar
Prophet Muhammad began disseminating Islam in Mecca, initially to his closest family and then to the poor and needy who suffered injustice [01:57:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">01:57:03</a>). The elite of Mecca initially opposed him due to their vested interests in polytheism and social control [02:53:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:35">02:53:35</a>). Due to persecution, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (the "Hijra" or migration) [01:00:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">01:00:34</a>). This event, marking the year zero of the Islamic calendar, symbolized the shift from persecution to autonomy and the establishment of an Islamic government [01:00:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">01:00:48</a>), [01:06:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">01:06:06</a>).

### Contributions to Public Administration
During the early [[Islamic history and cultural influence | Islamic empires]], many innovations in public administration were developed, such as institutions for animal welfare, asylums, orphanages, and funds to assist needy individuals with marriage [01:15:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">01:15:56</a>).

## [[Islamic extremism and Middle Eastern conflicts | Misconceptions and Challenges]]
### Terrorism
Terrorism is considered a choice of individuals or fanatic groups, not an inherent part of Islam [03:01:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:31">03:01:31</a>). It is seen as an act of aggression and disrespect, and attributing it to religion as a whole is a manipulation [03:01:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:31">03:01:31</a>).

### Sunni and Shiite Divisions
The division between Sunni and Shiite Muslims originated from a political disagreement over the succession of Prophet Muhammad [02:56:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:52">02:56:52</a>). Shiites believe leadership should be hereditary within the Prophet's family, while Sunnis believe it should be based on aptitude and knowledge [02:57:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:18">02:57:18</a>). Sunnis represent about 85% of all Muslims worldwide [02:57:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:35">02:57:35</a>).

### Palestine and Israel Conflict
From an Islamic perspective, the conflict between Palestine and Israel is viewed as a matter of justice and the right to heritage and land [02:46:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:39">02:46:39</a>), [02:48:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:35">02:48:35</a>). Palestinians (including Muslims, Christians, and Jews) lost their lands and country in 1948 with the creation of Israel, which is seen as a colonial act [02:44:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:37">02:44:37</a>), [02:46:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:54">02:46:54</a>). Historically, Muslims, Christians, and Jews coexisted peacefully in Jerusalem for centuries under Islamic rule [02:42:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:15">02:42:15</a>). The conflict is attributed to external influences starting around 1948 [02:42:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">02:42:51</a>).

## The Afterlife
Muslims believe in an eternal life after death [03:35:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:30">03:35:30</a>). Death is seen as the end of one phase and the beginning of another, not a definitive end [03:36:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">03:36:06</a>). The soul, which is the breath of God, never dies [03:36:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:13">03:36:13</a>). There is no belief in reincarnation [03:37:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:02">03:37:02</a>).

On the Day of Final Judgment, all people will be resurrected with their bodies and questioned about their deeds in this life [03:37:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">03:37:07</a>). Those who die believing in one God and whose good deeds outweigh their bad deeds will enter eternal paradise [03:37:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:16">03:37:16</a>). Paradise and hell are both real and physical places [03:37:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:45">03:37:45</a>). Paradise is a place of reward where individuals will have whatever they desire [03:38:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">03:38:00</a>).

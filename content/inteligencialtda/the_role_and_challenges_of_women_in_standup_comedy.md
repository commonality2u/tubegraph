Cris Paiva, a renowned comedian, shares her insights into the dynamics of the comedy industry, particularly from the perspective of a woman and mother. Her experiences highlight both the inclusive nature of standup and the specific [[gender_and_comedy_industry_dynamics | challenges and experiences in standup comedy]] faced by women in the field.

## Comedy as a "Big Company Without Walls"

Cris Paiva describes comedy as "a big company without walls" where comedians can freely collaborate and hire each other without needing formal permission or external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This environment means that no one should demand "satisfaction for anyone from your work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Comedians can book each other for shows, creating a fluid and collaborative space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Cris recounts how her former partner eventually became "no longer part of this great company" due to his actions, leading to a natural cessation of professional collaboration within the Brazilian comedy scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This demonstrates the self-regulating nature of the community.

## Personal Experiences Shaping Comedy

Cris Paiva's personal life, particularly her separation and journey as a single mother, has significantly influenced her comedy. She is "famous for making jokes about ex-husband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Her divorce served as the inspiration for her "most text expected from cometi center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>, a standup routine about her separation that went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

> "The text gave me a lot on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

She emphasizes that finding the right "Tom" or tone was crucial for this material, ensuring the audience could laugh along with her rather than pity her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This personal narrative has been a "liberator" not only professionally but also emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:52">[03:30:52]</a>.

## [[Challenges and experiences in standup comedy | Challenges and Experiences in Standup Comedy]] for Women

While standup is generally considered inclusive, Cris addresses specific [[gender_and_comedy_industry_dynamics | gender and comedy industry dynamics]] and [[challenges_of_being_a_comedian | challenges of being a comedian]] faced by women:

### Navigating Relationships and Ego
Cris describes how her former partner's ego was a challenge within their relationship, especially as she gained more recognition in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. She recounts feeling "guilty of my victories" because her success would often lead to a "butt face" from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This led her to decline opportunities or try to include him, hindering her own career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Quotas and Representation
Cris expresses strong reservations about quotas for women in comedy, arguing that merit should be the sole criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>. She finds it irritating that certain festivals mandate a percentage of female comedians, believing it can lead to unqualified women being put on stage, which ultimately harms the perception of women in comedy generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>.

> "It irritates me when I see it caught on a raw woman and give her space because then he says something like this It's bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.
> "Women are not good, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a> (This is the negative generalization she wants to avoid).

She advocates for encouraging women to build their skills and for successful female comedians to uplift beginners, rather than relying on mandated numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>.

### Stereotypes and Perceptions
Cris notes that there's a misconception that women in comedy only make "sex jokes" or talk about "small dick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:08">[02:50:08]</a>, when in reality, their material is diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. She asserts that a comedian's quality should be judged on their talent, not their gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>.

### Political and Ideological Boycotts
Cris touches on the [[challenges_in_navigating_controversial_humor | challenges in navigating controversial humor]] and political polarization within comedy. She highlights how some comedians face "boycott to the comedian no aligned with the biggest shitty ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a>, impacting their ability to work. She believes this "canceling" culture is counterproductive, as it narrows the scope of comedy and alienates audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## [[Collaborating with other comedians | Collaboration and Support]]

Despite the challenges, Cris emphasizes the strong sense of community and support among comedians. She credits [[danilo_gentilis_standup_comedy_career_and_challenges | Danilo Gentili]] for opening doors for her, allowing her to perform at his solo shows, which helped her gain visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:35">[03:00:35]</a>. She cherishes the genuine care and assistance she has received from him and others in the comedy circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>.

Cris is launching a new video podcast with Yasmin Yassine, which she believes will be the first of its kind featuring two women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. The show aims to be a general chat for all genders, not just "feminine" topics, offering "another Prisma and another look" on various subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>. This initiative demonstrates the drive for women to create their own spaces and narratives within the industry.

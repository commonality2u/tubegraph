## Early Life and Path to a Police Career

Born in Londrina, the interviewee moved to Maringá as a baby and was raised "on the street," experiencing a childhood filled with playing ball, mud fights, and "castor oil war" [00:08:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He describes it as a "root childhood," including playing "cops and robbers," where he always chose to be the police [00:09:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

At 16, after being caught graffitiing a school wall, which resulted in his father having to sign a document and paint over the damage, he decided to move to São Paulo when his grandmother invited him [00:10:58]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. He quickly found work in São Paulo's job market, which was thriving during the "economic miracle" of 1980 [00:12:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

At 19, he joined the [[experiences_in_the_military_police | Military Police]] [00:13:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. His desire to become a police officer stemmed from a childhood frustration when he couldn't ride in a police car, which some of his schoolmates had the opportunity to do [00:13:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. His older brother, who joined the Military Police in 1982, explained the competitive exam process [00:14:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He passed the Military Police competition in 1983 [00:14:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

His military training was described as "rigid" but provided a "certain structure of life" and "formed character" [00:14:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. He joined the police during the end of the dictatorship era [00:15:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. He celebrated March 31st (the date of the 1964 coup in Brazil) publicly, which led to a deputy filing an ethics council complaint against him, though nothing came of it [01:17:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

His [[career_and_experiences_of_a_police_officer | career progression]] involved starting as a soldier, then being promoted to corporal, sergeant, and finally first sergeant, the rank at which he retired [02:00:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>. Retirement is mandatory after 35 years of service or by reaching a certain age, depending on rank [02:04:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>. His last day of work was June 17th, when he reached his 35-year service limit [02:03:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[02:03:38]</a>.

## Experiences in Law Enforcement

### Highway Patrol and Drug/Contraband Interdiction

The interviewee's experience predominantly revolved around highway patrol, focusing on intercepting illicit goods and criminals.

*   **Drug Trafficking:**
    *   **Marijuana in Buses:** On his last day, he identified a young woman on a bus who seemed nervous and was carrying a bag with 12 kg of marijuana [00:30:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. A phone call to her accomplice led to the arrest of another woman carrying 10 kg of marijuana on a different bus, highlighting a common tactic of drug mules to travel separately [00:30:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
    *   **Cocaine in Fuel Tanks:** In another instance, a sniffer dog located 4 kg of cocaine hidden in the fuel tank of a Monza [00:41:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. The car had to be cut open by firefighters to retrieve the drugs [00:50:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. The value of such quantities suggests significant financial backing for these operations [00:43:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
    *   **Concealment Methods:** Drugs were often hidden in various places, including clothing, travel bags, and even in the lining of vehicle doors to fit more product [00:59:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. The use of sniffer dogs was crucial for detection, and the police also developed an intuition for suspicious behavior [00:44:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Contraband Smuggling:**
    *   **Varied Goods:** Smuggling from Paraguay was rampant, including pirated games, cell phone screens, toys, electronic goods, dental instruments, microphones, and even sex shop products [00:36:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
    *   **Organized Operations:** Larger scale operations involved hiring multiple individuals, like a businessman who hired 20 people to each bring their quota of goods, accumulating thousands of dollars worth of merchandise [00:34:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
    *   **Counterfeit Products:** A compressor was once seized that had 7 kg of crack hidden inside, only discovered by Federal Revenue Service (IRS) after a training course revealed specific methods of concealment [00:39:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
    *   **Human Trafficking/Illegal Entry:** The interviewee also encountered cases of illegal entry into the country, such as a bus full of Haitians entering through Paraguay [01:35:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>, and families of Arabs attempting to enter Brazil without proper visas due to bureaucratic difficulties [01:36:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>.
*   **Medicine Smuggling:** Certain medicines, like "strong rheumatism" and Cytotec (an abortifacient), were frequently smuggled due to their prohibition or high cost in Brazil [02:21:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:52">[02:21:52]</a>. Viagra and Sibutramine (for weight loss) were also common [02:22:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.
*   **Anabolic Steroids:** A significant amount of anabolic steroids, including those for horses, were seized due to their high market value and small size, making them easy to transport [02:25:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.
*   **Cigarette Smuggling:** The interviewee recalls numerous seizures of cigarettes, often transported in adapted vehicles like Astras and Vectras that could fit 30 to 35 boxes of cigarettes by ripping out interior linings [01:13:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Larger quantities were carried in trucks, sometimes openly with tarpaulins, or hidden among other goods [01:10:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. "Beaters" or scouts would drive ahead to warn truck drivers about police presence [01:10:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

### Vehicle Theft and Recovery

The interviewee encountered many cases of stolen vehicles, often used for transporting contraband. In one incident, two stolen Renegades were recovered after the drivers, who were brothers, inadvertently stopped when ordered to [00:53:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Another case involved an S10 pickup truck with a fake license plate that belonged to an identical truck parked in its owner's garage [00:56:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Vehicles, particularly Astras, were often stolen or fraudulently financed to be used in cigarette smuggling [00:57:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

### Serious Crimes and Investigations

*   **Child Rape and Murder:** The interviewee recounts a harrowing case of a 10-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, her body found after her younger sister reported seeing her with a neighbor [02:23:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:17">[02:23:17]</a>.
*   **[[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations | Notable Crime Cases and Investigations]] - "Natanael Buffalo":** He details the case of "Natanael Buffalo," a man who, after serving a sentence for sexually abusing a teenager, later gained the trust of a church community in Maringá before kidnapping, raping, murdering, and burning an 11-year-old girl [02:26:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>.
*   **[[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations | Notable Crime Cases and Investigations]] - "Tower Maniac":** The "Tower Maniac" in Maringá killed six or seven women, all prostitutes [02:30:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:33">[02:30:33]</a>. The killer was identified through a piece of car paint found at a crime scene and security camera footage [02:31:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:09">[02:31:09]</a>. The interviewee had a prior encounter with the "Tower Maniac" who tried to attack him and a colleague with a pickaxe [02:34:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>.

### Confrontations and Shootouts

The interviewee describes a significant shootout that occurred near the end of his career. His team encountered a car with three armed men who opened fire with pistols [02:05:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:28">[02:05:28]</a>. The police returned fire, forcing the criminals to abandon their vehicle [02:06:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>. Inside, they found four long guns (12-gauge carbines), a vest with fake explosives and a timer, and "Miguelitos" (iron artifacts designed to puncture tires) [02:06:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>.

### Accidents and Emergency Response

During his time on highway patrol, the interviewee witnessed and responded to numerous accidents.

*   **Scene Management:** The first priority at an accident scene is to signal the track to prevent further collisions [01:38:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>. Victims are assisted, and specialized police are called [01:38:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.
*   **Fatal Accidents:**
    *   **Vehicle Fire:** A particularly tragic accident involved a Corolla and a Pointer colliding. The Pointer caught fire with three people inside, including a 15-year-old girl whose foot was trapped [01:39:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. The car burned quickly, and the girl's burned body had to be removed by firefighters [01:40:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>.
    *   **Drunk Driving:** He often encountered drunk drivers and would remove their car keys to prevent them from causing accidents [01:42:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>.
    *   **Bus Accident:** A new bus, traveling from the Northeast, veered off the road into a ravine near a bridge to avoid a collision, causing passengers to be disoriented [01:43:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. Two firefighters on board helped evacuate passengers [01:43:58]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:58">[01:43:58]</a>.
    *   **Motorcyclist Fatality:** A motorcyclist was hit by multiple cars on the highway after falling, leaving his body severely dismembered [01:48:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:13">[01:48:13]</a>.
    *   **Pedestrian Fatality:** A woman, disoriented and drunk, was run over by a car on the highway, resulting in her head being severed by the car's rearview mirror [01:49:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:16">[01:49:16]</a>.

## Reflections on Law Enforcement and Society

### Perception of Police Work

The interviewee believes that [[public_perception_and_the_reality_of_customs_and_drug_enforcement_work | public perception]] often undervalues police work, especially when large seizures are reported [01:45:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. He highlights that police often rely on "willpower" and "experience" rather than just "information" or "crystal balls" to make arrests [01:46:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>.

### Views on Drug Use and Crime

He distinguishes between casual marijuana use and criminal behavior, stating that while not all marijuana users are "bums," all "bums" (criminals) are often marijuana users [01:55:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:45">[01:55:45]</a>. He acknowledges that some users lead productive lives, but also notes that for many, marijuana use leads to other drugs and crime [01:56:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:10">[01:56:10]</a>. He views any illegal act as such, but would enforce the law if marijuana were legalized [01:56:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:51">[01:56:51]</a>. He applies a similar logic to alcohol, acknowledging that some people drink responsibly while others "go to the gutter" due to alcoholism [01:57:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:27">[01:57:27]</a>.

### Personal Impact of Difficult Cases

The interviewee admitted that some experiences, like witnessing the burned body of the 15-year-old girl in the car fire, were "very strong" for him [02:29:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>. Seeing too many accidents led him to think about his own family, causing a "selfishness" when confirming the car model in an accident wasn't his family's [01:47:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>. He states he doesn't regret killing criminals as he views them as "human evil" and a "relief to society" [02:22:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>.

### Role as a Legislator in Public Security

After retirement, he was "pushed into politics" by people who saw his potential [02:44:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:30">[02:44:30]</a>. He became a federal deputy in 2018, the most voted in Paraná with 314,963 votes [02:48:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>. His main focus is on [[public_safety_and_law_enforcement | public safety and law enforcement]], advocating for valuing public security operators with "decent wages, decent working hours," and "first world vehicles, weapons, and equipment" [02:49:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>.

### Views on Gun Control

The interviewee believes in the right of "good citizens" to carry and possess weapons for self-defense [02:27:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. He advocates for stricter laws for those who misuse weapons [02:27:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. He works to annul restrictive decrees on armament and opposes taxes on weapons, viewing them as making ownership unfeasible [02:38:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. He supports providing rifles to every police vehicle in Paraná for initial confrontations with armed criminals [02:12:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>.

### Views on Justice and Criminal Punishment

The interviewee is a strong advocate for tougher penalties for criminals.
*   **Life Imprisonment and Death Penalty:** He is personally in favor of the death penalty for criminals involved in cases like child murder but is pursuing life imprisonment through a plebiscite due to the constitutional and political [[challenges_in_addressing_violent_crimes_legally_and_socially | challenges in addressing violent crimes legally and socially]] of the death penalty [02:28:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:06">[02:28:06]</a>. He notes that currently, murderers in Brazil serve a maximum of 10 to 15 years, despite potential sentences up to 30 years [02:29:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:33">[02:29:33]</a>.
*   **Organ Donation from Criminals:** He proposed a project for compulsory organ donation from criminals killed in confrontation with police, arguing that their organs should be given to those on transplant waiting lists as a "return to society" [02:53:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:16">[02:53:16]</a>. This project was rejected for being "against human dignity" [02:53:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>.
*   **Serial Killers:** He is working on a project to typify "serial criminal" or "serial killer" in Brazil, a classification currently absent [02:30:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>.

### Views on Censorship Bill

He strongly opposes the censorship bill, primarily because it was reported by a "communist" deputy and is supported by "television networks" and "artists" from the left, whom he views as aiming for "financial profits" and fearful of the "democratic advancement" of internet platforms [02:57:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:41">[02:57:41]</a>. He sees it as a "great lobby" that restricts freedom of speech and platform content [02:59:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>. He cites an instance where the Supreme Federal Court (STF) ordered Telegram to remove its opinion on the bill and post the Minister's opinion instead, illustrating perceived censorship [03:05:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:44">[03:05:44]</a>.

### Views on Organized Crime (PCC)

He considers "killing bandits" and "cutting the financial power" of criminal factions, such as the PCC, as key strategies against them [03:33:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>. He notes that the PCC has "27 thousand members" in Brazil and engages in large-scale drug trafficking [03:35:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:20">[03:35:20]</a>. He works to increase penalties for cell phone theft and robbery, as these crimes significantly impact ordinary citizens' lives [03:37:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:10">[03:37:10]</a>.

## Health and Personal Life

The interviewee revealed he suffered five heart attacks, three of which occurred while on duty in Military Police vehicles [02:36:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:55">[02:36:55]</a>. One heart attack happened upon learning of a friend's death, and another while breaking into a drug dealer's house [02:37:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. He underwent heart surgery at 40, having five bypasses, and is now "fine" but gets tired easily [02:43:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:15">[02:43:15]</a>.

He recounts an incident where he was sued by the Federal Public Ministry for referring to arrested criminals as "fat," "chubby," and "Robocop" during an interview [03:09:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:39">[03:09:39]</a>. He paid a fine of R$100 per month and had to sign in court for two years as a result [03:10:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:46">[03:10:46]</a>. He also faced a lawsuit from Marcola, the head of the PCC, for comments made about him in a podcast [03:14:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:09">[03:14:09]</a>.

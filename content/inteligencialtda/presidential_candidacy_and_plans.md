## Presidential Candidacy and Plans

Pablo Marçal outlines his motivations and proposals for a presidential run, emphasizing a desire to transform Brazil through new leadership and economic strategies.

### Motivation for Candidacy

Pablo Marçal decided to run for president on January 28th, while in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. He expresses that Brazil is "led by people that doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and acknowledges his disgust with politics, but understands that one is "always governed by what you are disgusted by" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. His ultimate goal is to win the election, not merely to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. He believes that 60% of the Brazilian population does not want either [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]] or [[arguments_over_jair_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

He highlights the significant personal sacrifices involved in his candidacy, including convincing his wife, children, parents, and over 100 business partners from his 26 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. His revenue has stopped growing for the first time in 15 years since he spoke about politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. He even sold one of his companies for six times below its invested value to dedicate himself fully to public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Marçal also states that if he becomes president, he will never sell another course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. He made a promise to his children not to handle public money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

### Government Plans and Proposals

Marçal's vision for Brazil is centered on transformation, focusing on economic growth, job creation, and a shift in national mentality.

#### Economic and Administrative Reforms
He believes Brazil's main problem is its mentality, advocating for a shift to encourage growth and individual prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. He proposes a plan called "Seeds for Govern" (SPG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>.

Key proposals include:
*   **Decriminalizing Success and Prosperity:** His first decree as president would be to decriminalize success and prosperity, aiming to "release the Brazilian to thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.
*   **Reducing Bureaucracy and Taxes:** He supports free markets, individual freedom, and reducing taxes and bureaucracy for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:17">[02:28:17]</a>. He aims to simplify Brazil's complex tax system and proposes an "electronic tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.
*   **Addressing Internal Debt:** He recognizes that 78% of collected money goes to internal debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>, proposing negotiation with the 200 families who hold these court orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.
*   **Pension Reform:** He identifies pension (Social Security) as the main issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>, noting the system is "withering, swallowing everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.
*   **Digital University and Entrepreneurship:** He plans to create a federal digital university with no physical locations, leveraging existing education funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:28">[02:15:28]</a>. This university would instruct people to undertake via e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:03">[02:15:03]</a>.
*   **Opposition to Wealth Tax:** He opposes taxing large fortunes or dividends, arguing it leads to capital flight, as seen in Uruguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:36">[02:16:36]</a>. He emphasizes that Brazil is already good from a fiscal perspective for holding wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:06">[02:18:06]</a>.
*   **Public College Fees:** He supports charging tuition for public colleges, arguing that the poor, who cannot pass entrance exams, end up subsidizing the rich who can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:58">[02:18:58]</a>.

#### Infrastructure and Energy
Marçal stresses the importance of infrastructure, noting there are 22,000 paralyzed works in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. He believes investing in infrastructure can significantly reduce unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>.

Regarding energy:
*   **Petrobras Privatization:** He advocates for privatizing Petrobras and fragmenting it into multiple companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>. He recalls that the "PPI" (Import Parity Price) was implemented in the Michel Temer government to prevent Petrobras from breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41">[01:39:41]</a>.
*   **Energy Matrix Expansion:** He aims to double or triple Brazil's energy matrix in the next 10 years, particularly by activating refining platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>. He notes that by 2030, combustion cars will be phased out globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:49">[01:39:49]</a>.
*   **Niobium and Graphene:** Brazil holds 95% of the world's niobium reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:41">[02:57:41]</a>, and Marçal believes Brazil should dictate its price, not the London Metal Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:43">[02:59:43]</a>. He also mentions graphene as a key resource for technology production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:28">[03:00:28]</a>.
*   **Satellite Utilization:** He highlights that Telebras has a 400 million real satellite that is not being used, which could be pointed to the Amazon for mapping and tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>.

#### Public Security and Justice
Marçal views public security as a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

His proposals include:
*   **Unified Police System:** Unifying police systems across federal, civil, and military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:40">[02:37:40]</a>.
*   **Valuing Police:** Rewarding police and removing chest cameras, arguing they create insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:36">[02:38:36]</a>.
*   **Criminal Legislation Reform:** Reforming the 82-year-old penal code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:22">[02:21:22]</a>, and including concepts like "punishability exclusion" and "resocialization" in early childhood education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:32">[02:09:32]</a>.
*   **Prison System Reform:** Treating prisons like businesses, using private companies to manage them and employing prisoners in productive work, reducing the R$1800/head cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.
*   **Weapons Policy:** He is in favor of Brazilians having the right to self-defense, especially in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He proposes that invading a residence be classified as a crime of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:21">[02:42:21]</a>.
*   **Combating Factions:** He notes the existence of 34 criminal factions in Brazil and warns that without a shift, a PCC president could emerge in 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:06">[02:41:06]</a>.

#### Social Issues and Education
Marçal believes that "Brazil is not condemned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> and highlights the need to address social issues, especially with 35 million people experiencing hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

He states:
*   **Family Values:** He points to the "destruction of the father" as a cultural issue, noting that on Father's Day, only 10 fathers show up at prisons compared to 80 mothers on Mother's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:59">[01:55:59]</a>. He proposes a "parenthood plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:03">[01:56:03]</a>.
*   **Sport and Education Integration:** He advocates for the Ministry of Sports to be integrated into the education portfolio, believing sport enhances emotional health and reduces school dropout rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:20">[02:34:20]</a>.
*   **Combating Marxism:** He discusses the concept of "Cultural Marxism," which he believes aims to destroy the nation by gradually taking over culture rather than by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>. He wrote a book on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:34">[01:51:34]</a>.

### Approach to Governance and Political Strategy

Marçal aims to professionalize public management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:04">[02:54:04]</a>.
*   **Cabinet Formation:** He plans to have 25 Ministries, believing it reduces corruption more than Bolsonaro's 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. He evaluates potential ministers based on technical positions, honesty, and loyalty, without being tied to political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
*   **Rewarding Good Governance:** He proposes a government portal to financially reward the best rulers and ideas among the 70,000 politicians in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>.
*   **Political Independence:** Marçal claims political parties do not control him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a> and that he will not sell his soul for the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. He asserts his determination not to take photos or make statements dictated by parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.
*   **No Re-election Commitment:** As a proposal for electoral reform, he states he would commit in writing on day one to not seek re-election, enabling faster reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:20">[02:53:20]</a>.
*   **National Unity:** He rejects the division of Brazilians into "left or right," arguing that 70% of the population does not care about such distinctions, especially those facing hunger or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He emphasizes uniting Brazil through the "harmonization of difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>.
*   **Against Traditional Politics:** He criticizes career politicians for "enhanc[ing] misery" to secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>. He sees himself as a "politician from the private sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>, aiming to accelerate the process of Brazilian transformation by being in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.
*   **Handling Crises:** Drawing on the concept that "no one strong who has had an easy past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:34">[02:57:34]</a> and that "crisis shows if you are weak or not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>, he believes Brazil is in a "storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:15">[02:59:15]</a> and needs courageous leadership.

#### Views on Other Political Figures
*   **Jair Bolsonaro**: Marçal claims that [[arguments_over_jair_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro]] and [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]] made a "personal agreement" to avoid a second round with anyone else, as it's "cheaper and wears out less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He feels [[arguments_over_jair_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro]] "appropriated hope" and "destroyed their team hopeful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. He criticizes Bolsonaro for involving religiosity in politics and having a "hatred that involves faith and politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. He believes Bolsonaro is losing the election due to the economy and high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:50">[02:07:50]</a>.
*   **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva**: He says [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]] has a different dictatorial style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a> and that he "enhanced this misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:15">[02:21:15]</a> in Brazil. He notes that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]]'s government opened 56 state-owned companies, liking a "giant state" that "enslaves the others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>.
*   **Juscelino Kubitschek**: Marçal sees Juscelino Kubitschek as a great inspiration because he was the "only guy who put a government program" and "fulfilled 100%" of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>, moving Brazil 30% further into the map by building Brasília <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

#### Challenges and Controversies
Marçal acknowledges that "success is criminalized" in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a> and discusses past [[accusations_and_controversies_surrounding_political_figures | controversies]].

*   **Pico dos Marins Incident:** He addresses the incident where he led a group up Pico dos Marins during adverse weather, which resulted in media attention and accusations of irresponsibility. He clarifies that no one was injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:19">[02:55:19]</a>, no helicopter was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:10">[02:55:10]</a>, and firefighters were not needed for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:21">[02:55:21]</a>. He admits to regretting the embarrassment from the negative media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>, but states he would not deny prayer or change his approach if faced with a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:32">[02:59:32]</a>. He views the incident as a learning experience, stating he learned enough not to repeat the "same simple mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">[02:58:33]</a>.
*   **Silas Malafaia and Nando Moura:** He discusses past clashes, including with Pastor Silas Malafaia, whom he says called him a "megalomaniac" and "psychopath" for being against Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Marçal later apologized and removed a video criticizing Malafaia, expressing regret for engaging in what he called "stupid" fights that don't build anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>. He accuses Malafaia of using his position for political manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a>.
*   **Criticism of Sincerity:** Marçal is repeatedly questioned about his sincerity and whether his motives are altruistic or for personal gain, with some suggesting he aims to "capitalize" on his political involvement for his business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. He consistently denies that his primary motivation is personal or financial gain, stating that he is doing it for Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.## Presidential Candidacy and Plans

He emphasizes uniting Brazil through the "harmonization of difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>.

#### Views on Other Political Figures
*   **Jair Bolsonaro**: Marçal claims that [[arguments_over_jair_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro]] and [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]] made a "personal agreement" to avoid a second round with anyone else, as it's "cheaper and wears out less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He feels [[arguments_over_jair_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro]] "appropriated hope" and "destroyed their team hopeful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. He criticizes Bolsonaro for involving religiosity in politics and having a "hatred that involves faith and politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. He believes Bolsonaro is losing the election due to the economy and high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:50">[02:07:50]</a>.
*   **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva**: He says [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]] has a different dictatorial style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a> and that he "enhanced this misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:15">[02:21:15]</a> in Brazil. He notes that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_brazil | Lula]]'s government opened 56 state-owned companies, liking a "giant state" that "enslaves the others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>.
*   **Juscelino Kubitschek**: Marçal sees Juscelino Kubitschek as a great inspiration because he was the "only guy who put a government program" and "fulfilled 100%" of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>, moving Brazil 30% further into the map by building Brasília <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

He admits to regretting the embarrassment from the negative media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>, but states he would not deny prayer or change his approach if faced with a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:32">[02:59:32]</a>. He views the incident as a learning experience, stating he learned enough not to repeat the "same simple mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">[02:58:33]</a>.
*   **Silas Malafaia and Nando Moura:** He discusses past clashes, including with Pastor Silas Malafaia, whom he says called him a "megalomaniac" and "psychopath" for being against Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

He consistently denies that his primary motivation is personal or financial gain, stating that he is doing it for Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

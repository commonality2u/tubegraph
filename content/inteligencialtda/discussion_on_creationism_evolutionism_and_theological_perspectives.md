The program "Limited Intelligence" hosted Rog√©rio Vilera and a pastor to discuss various theological topics, including the [[creationism_versus_evolutionism_debate | creationism versus evolutionism debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

## Creationism as an Article of Faith

The pastor refutes the notion that [[evolution_and_biblical_narratives | evolutionism]] is "Science" and [[creationism_versus_evolutionism_debate | creationism]] is "superstition," stating that this assertion does not deserve full credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. He clarifies that [[creationism_versus_evolutionism_debate | creationism]] is an article of faith and religion, not a science article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

### Challenging Scientific "Truths"

The discussion highlights four basic ideas often applauded as scientific truths but lacking sufficient evidence:
*   **Eternal Matter**: The Greek idea that matter is eternal is refuted; matter was created, as only God is eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. The Bible states that "all things were done through him [Christ], without him nothing that was done if done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
*   **Spontaneous Generation**: The idea that the world gave birth to itself is dismissed; it did not call itself into existence or generate on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
*   **Cosmic Chance (Big Bang)**: The theory of a mega-explosion that brought the world into being through chance is questioned due to a "lack of evidence of the evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. It is argued that "disorder does not produce order," "chaos does not produce the cosmos," and a "casual explosion does not produce such a vast universe with such precise laws with such surgical movements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Charles Darwin's Evolutionism**: Darwin's 1859 book, *On the Origin of Species*, contains many verbs in the future subjunctive, implying a lack of robust evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Past and present scientists are presented as [[creationism_versus_evolutionism_debate | creationists]] who demonstrate a "planning" and "plan" in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

### The Design Argument

Arguments for a Creator's plan are presented through examples of intricate design:
*   **Earth's Position**: If Earth were further from the Sun, it would freeze; if closer, it would burn, indicating its precise placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
*   **Moon's Function**: The moon is described as the "cleaning lady of planet earth," regulating ocean tides necessary for life, implying a deliberate plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Human Anatomy**: Features like the nose being turned downwards (to prevent rain from entering) and the location of the mouth are cited as evidence of design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
*   **Genetics and DNA**: Referencing Nobel Prize laureate Marchal Nirenberg's discoveries, it is stated that the human body's 60 trillion cells contain 1.70 cm of DNA ribbon each, with all genetic data recorded and computerized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. This immense length of DNA, if stretched, would span 102 billion kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. The argument is that "codes of life were planted in us by the almighty God creator of the heavens and the earth," and this is "irrefutable science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

## Biblical Interpretation of Creation

The discussion addresses the interpretation of Genesis regarding the six days of creation:
*   The pastor believes the days were "Literal 24 hour days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:58">[02:46:58]</a>. This is supported by Exodus 20:9-11, which uses the six days of creation as a basis for the Sabbath, implying literal 24-hour periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>.
*   The creation of the sun on the fourth day is cited as confirmation that subsequent days were 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>.
*   The "gap theory" (the idea that there was a long period between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2, possibly accommodating [[evolution_and_biblical_narratives | evolution]]) is rejected. The phrase "the earth was formless and empty" does not mean it "became without empty form" due to an angelic fall, but rather details God's "macro project" of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:41">[02:48:41]</a>.
*   Connecting to [[evolution_and_biblical_narratives | Darwinism]], the pastor states that interpretations allowing for millions of years "will fall exactly in the lap of the [[evolution_and_biblical_narratives | evolution]] of [[evolution_and_biblical_narratives | Darwinism]]" as a way of "trying to marry Christ and Darwin," which is called [[philosophy_and_theological_interpretations | "atheistic evolutionism"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:49">[02:49:49]</a>.

## Reconciling Science and Faith

The pastor asserts that when the Bible is "correctly interpreted" and science is "correctly understood," they "does not enter into a collision course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. This is because both have the "same author, who is God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. While God cannot be proven, the belief in creation is by faith, as stated in Hebrews 11:3: "By faith we understand that it was the universe formed by the word of God so that the visible came into existence of the things that do not appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

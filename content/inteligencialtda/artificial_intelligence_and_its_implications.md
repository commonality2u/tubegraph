## Advancements and Applications
[[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | Artificial intelligence]] has reached a significant level of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. New programs like Sora can create animations and 60-second videos from simple text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Other examples include ChatGPT, which answers questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, and Midjourney, which generates images and paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Advanced technology already exists that can make a person appear to be speaking in another language with their voice and mouth movements, making it difficult to distinguish from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Some personal projects demonstrate the potential for nurturing AI. For instance, "Biazinha" is an [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | AI]] program fed with books and lectures to improve its responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_society | Societal Impact and Concerns]]

### Disconnecting from Reality
A significant concern is the potential for people to live virtual lives and lose connection with real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. With [[advancements_in_technology_and_potential_impacts | advancements in technology]] like Apple's smart glasses, individuals might walk down a real street while connected to a virtual reality, leading to a profound disconnection from others and from physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. This virtual existence can lead to believing in a self-created reality as the only truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Job Market and Future Professions
The [[impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_society | impact of artificial intelligence on society]] is expected to be significant in the job market. It's predicted that children today will work in professions that don't yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> and may have at least five lifelong professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, a stark contrast to previous generations who often had one career for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Professions like dubbers are already seeing their work threatened by [[artificial_intelligence_and_robotics | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Historically, humanity has always reinvented itself with new technologies, as seen with the decline of roles like bus fare collectors, gas station attendants, and supermarket cashiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

### Mental Health and Social Behavior
The rise of [[impacts_of_social_media_and_artificial_intelligence_on_society | social media and artificial intelligence]] contributes to increased anxiety and depression among young people. A Fiocruz survey showed a 6% rise in suicide and a 29% rise in self-harm among young adults and teenagers from 2011 to 2022, with a clear link to the fear of "cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Social media fosters a culture where individuals passively consume others' lives and actively criticize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, leading to a need for constant approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

The "performance society," where individuals feel solely responsible for their success and failure, exacerbates depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. This contrasts with earlier societies where oppression was an external problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. People become "products on shelves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>, seeking validation and sometimes losing their essence as human beings if they advertise something they don't believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

## [[concerns_and_misconceptions_about_ai | Ethical Considerations and Limitations]]

### The Singularity and Control
A significant [[concerns_and_misconceptions_about_ai | concern about AI]] is the possibility of "singularity," where machines surpass human understanding and control, potentially leading to a scenario reminiscent of "Blade Runner" replicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. However, it's noted that AI is driven by numbers and requires human programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The real concern lies with the parameters and biases introduced by programmers; if AI learns from hate-filled social media, it can become racist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

### Neuralink and Brain Manipulation
Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-chip technology, raises ethical questions. While promising to restore movement for those with spinal cord injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>, there are concerns about its potential to alter personality, erase memories, or reduce violence, effectively programming individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>. The historical example of lobotomies, which removed the ability to act violently but not the violent thoughts, serves as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. The challenge is that changing execution does not change the core feeling or empathy, which AI cannot yet instill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>.

### AI in Relationships
The idea of virtual girlfriends powered by [[artificial_intelligence_and_robotics | artificial intelligence]] is seen as psychologically detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. This mirrors the themes in the movie "Her," where a man falls in love with an AI assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. Such relationships prevent individuals from investing fully in real human connections, as AI can always provide what the person wants to hear and serve multiple "partners" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.

## The Future of Psychology
Psychology and psychiatry are considered some of the last specialties to be replaced by [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>. While AI might assist with disease diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:09">[02:20:09]</a> or robotic surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:17">[02:20:17]</a>, the human-to-human interaction inherent in therapy is something [[limitations_of_artificial_intelligence_and_human_cognition | artificial intelligence]] cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>. For aspiring psychologists, studying neuroscience, neuromodulator techniques, and evidence-based therapies is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:33">[02:20:33]</a>.

Comedy and humor can vary significantly across cultures, reflecting national traits, historical contexts, and social norms. [[international_comparisons_in_comedy | International comparisons in comedy]] highlight how jokes that land well in one country might fall flat or even offend in another.

## Humor Styles by Country

### Brazil
Brazilian humor often involves self-ridicule and finding humor in misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. There is a concept of "fifth-grade humor" in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Brazilians are described as very playful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:37">[02:20:37]</a>. The meme culture is deeply integrated into Brazilian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>, and online comments from Brazilians can sometimes be perceived as having "no limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>.

### France
French humor is characterized as drier, observational, and less focused on misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:38">[02:32:38]</a>. It can be "very, very dry," making it difficult for Brazilians to discern if a statement is a joke or arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:47">[02:32:47]</a>. The concept of "turning pain into laughter" exists in French comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>.

### Germany
German humor is generally less prone to offense, with people accepting jokes made about their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:25">[02:52:25]</a>. This acceptance is partly due to historical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:31">[02:52:31]</a>.

### African Countries
Similar to Brazil, North African countries like Algeria and Morocco also share a humor style that jokes about misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:55">[02:29:55]</a>.

## Perceptions of Humor Across Cultures
[[perceptions_of_humor_across_cultures | Perceptions of humor across cultures]] vary greatly. For instance, a joke about a Brazilian goalkeeper who committed suicide in 1950 after losing a World Cup final might be considered a joke by some, but others might see it as inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>.

### Challenges in Cross-Cultural Comedy
Performing comedy in a foreign country, especially with references specific to one's home country, can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Audiences might not understand local references, for example, jokes about Brazilian slang or motorcycle culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

One comedian recalled performing a show in France where the audience did not want a Portuguese-language show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. Brazilians who live abroad may also perform for a Brazilian community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

An individual's status as a foreigner can sometimes make them an "easy target" for jokes or exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.

### Humor and Social Sensitivity
In Brazil, certain topics like politics and football are generally avoided by comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:58">[05:49:58]</a>. Jokes about the Amazon can also be sensitive due to political conflicts between French and Brazilian presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:52">[05:55:52]</a>. Religion is also considered a sensitive topic due to its importance in Brazilian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:05">[05:06:05]</a>.

There is a growing trend in Brazil to "criminalize" or restrict certain types of jokes, which some argue can devalue real problems and create more taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:45">[02:42:45]</a>. This contrasts with countries where humor is seen as less of a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:30">[02:38:30]</a>.

While some believe all topics can be joked about if the intention is good and the context is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:28">[02:41:28]</a>, others argue that certain subjects are off-limits for humor, such as historical tragedies in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>.

### The Role of Social Media
[[the_role_of_social_media_in_spreading_comedy | The role of social media in spreading comedy]] can be complex. While Brazil is a top country for social media usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:36">[03:38:36]</a>, France, for example, has a culture that is generally less keen on social media, seeing it as "tacky" to idolize someone or excessively share private life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:01">[03:34:01]</a>. This can impact how comedy and individual content creators gain traction. Online "cancellation culture" is prevalent in Brazil, where people actively seek to cancel someone for perceived offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>.

### Learning and Performing Comedy
Comedians often start with "Open Mikes" to learn and perform short sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Developing a full solo show typically takes one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:26">[03:06:26]</a>. Performing abroad can be challenging due to language barriers and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. Some comedians plan to create content with subtitles that are funny in both their home country and the target country, focusing on universal jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:25">[03:04:25]</a>.

## Cultural Differences in Interaction

Beyond humor, general cultural differences also impact communication and daily interactions:
*   **Directness vs. Politeness**: French culture is described as more direct in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>, often preferring to state the "real thing" as a form of help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. In Brazil, being too direct can be perceived as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. Brazilian politeness can sometimes be indirect, leading to misunderstandings for foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **Social Norms**: In France, it's not common to "invite someone out" in the same way as in Brazil; instead, people talk about taking a coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. In Brazil, it is common for the person who invites to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>, whereas in France, there is no such expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>.
*   **Physical Contact and Modesty**: Brazilian culture is generally more liberal regarding physical expressions like kissing multiple people in one night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. While carnival allows for nudity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, saunas with family are generally not acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. In France, topless sunbathing is acceptable, but thong bikinis are not common and are frowned upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
*   **Personal Space**: In Europe, staring at someone can be considered harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. There is also a cultural shyness in approaching women in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.
*   **Cleanliness Habits**: French people use less deodorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:58">[02:09:58]</a>, which can lead to stronger body odors in public places like subways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>. In contrast, Brazilians use more perfume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:20">[02:10:20]</a>.
*   **Financial Perceptions**: In Brazil, expressing wealth by saying "Thank God I am" is common, rather than explicitly stating "I am rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:22:45]</a>. Travelling to Europe or buying certain items can be perceived as "rich" in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>. Conversely, in Germany, being homeless can be an option due to government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>.
*   **Parental Homes**: In France, people tend to move out of their parents' homes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:09">[03:20:09]</a>.

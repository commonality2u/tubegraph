He began his career in radio before transitioning to television, facing various challenges and contributing to the show's significant impact on media.

## Early Life and Unexpected Career Path
Marcos Chiesa initially pursued a college degree in Biology, a field he "always liked" but found exact sciences challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>. He even considered studying veterinary medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>. His academic path unexpectedly shifted during a college vacation when he sought something to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

## Radio Career: The Genesis of Pânico
Chiesa's journey into radio began with a chance opportunity through friends who worked at Transamérica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:05">[02:30:05]</a>. He started in promotions, distributing stickers and prizes, a role he found enjoyable and less like work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:05">[02:31:05]</a>. After a year without pay, he was officially hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:05">[02:41:05]</a>.

He later moved to Rádio Cidade, continuing in promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. His big break came when he joined Jovem Pan, still in a promotional capacity, but eventually became a key part of *Pânico* on the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.

Initially, he was hesitant to participate in the show, feeling "shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>. However, he gradually started talking "nonsense," which was well-received by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. His nickname "Marcão da Nem" was given by Emílio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

The radio show, co-hosted by Emílio Batista and Billy, involved interviewing people on the street about various topics, from marijuana legalization to more absurd discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Marcos would often interject with "nonsense" or provocative statements, which the hosts encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>. The show's success on radio led to its expansion nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Pânico Radio:
*   **Improvisation:** The show thrived on spontaneity, with Marcos often saying whatever came to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>.
*   **Controversial Humor:** The show was known for its edgy, often "cursing" humor, which resonated with audiences at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:15">[03:18:15]</a>.
*   **Audience Connection:** The show fostered a sense of community, making listeners feel like "part of that group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>.

## Transition to Television: Pânico na TV
The idea of bringing *Pânico* to television initially faced skepticism and significant financial challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. The first year of *Pânico na TV* yielded "zero" earnings, with the team even using their own money to buy equipment and cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This period of [[experiences_and_stories_from_behind_the_scenes_at_pnico_na_tv | behind-the-scenes experiences]] involved learning how to produce a show with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

Marcos believes his earlier experience doing segments for Luciano Huck's show, "Caldeirão do Huck," helped lay the groundwork for *Pânico na TV* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

### Iconic Segments and Pranks:
*   **Pânico Delivery:** A segment where intoxicated individuals were driven home by "Panícats," often with humorous and unexpected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. These stunts could be quite dangerous, with one incident involving a Panicat throwing up on the back of another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Five Ways To...:** This segment involved demonstrating various, often absurd, ways to achieve a goal, such as giving a birthday gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Marcos himself participated in a segment involving waxing, which he described as "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Dangerous Stunts:** *Pânico* was known for its extreme stunts, including Marcos being locked in a coffin set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, being stung by bees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, and sitting on an anthill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. These stunts often resulted in injuries, including a broken rib and a swollen face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Interviews and Characters:** The show frequently interviewed celebrities, sometimes using provocative or embarrassing questions. Characters like "Sabrina" (Sabrina Sato) were pivotal, and her popularity from Big Brother Brasil made her a key element for the show's composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The show often featured random people who became popular characters, such as "Alemão" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_pnico_na_tv | Challenges and Controversies]]:
*   **Censorship and Pressure:** The show faced pressure due to its controversial nature, with a constant need to balance humor with potential backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Instances like throwing cockroaches at a woman's head led to criticism and calls from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Expectations:** The pursuit of high ratings created immense stress, forcing the team to constantly innovate and push boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Departure of Key Cast Members:** Over time, popular cast members like Sabrina Sato, Ceará, and Japinha left the show, creating challenges for continuity and maintaining audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Humor and Media Evolution
Marcos Chiesa observed a significant shift in [[the_evolution_and_changes_in_brazilian_entertainment_media | entertainment media]] over his career. He noted that humor in the past allowed for more freedom and less concern about being "politically correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. He believes *Pânico* stood out by "taking those off the pedestal," referring to celebrities and public figures who were previously seen as untouchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This approach allowed the show to be "different" and "refreshing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

He acknowledges that the modern era, with social media, has intensified scrutiny and made some of *Pânico*'s past antics impossible today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

## Personal Health and Future Endeavors
In recent years, Marcos Chiesa has undergone heart surgery, requiring four stents, and has adopted significant lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, to manage his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. He mentioned that these health issues prompted him to reassess his habits, especially regarding smoking and unhealthy eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

He continues to be involved in content creation, expressing a desire to work on his YouTube channel and pursue projects related to cars and motorcycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He also enjoys traveling and experiencing different cultures, often incorporating these experiences into his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

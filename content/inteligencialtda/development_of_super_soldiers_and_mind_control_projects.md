The development of "super soldiers" and the implementation of mind control projects have been explored by various military powers, often intertwined with [[paranormal_soldiers_and_occ_in_world_war_ii | occultism]] and [[research_into_unexplained_phenomena | unexplained phenomena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## US Projects

### Project Stargate
Project Stargate was initiated by the United States with the goal of creating military psychics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>. It was based at Fort Meade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>.

*   **Motivation**: The US began to believe that Russians had paranormal spies due to strange occurrences, such as the leaking of atomic codes by a general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The theory was that Russian paranormal spies accessed the general's dreams to steal confidential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This concept resembles Christopher Nolan's *Inception* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Key Figures**:
    *   **General Albert Stubblebine**: A three-star Major General and head of Army intelligence for 10 years, he commissioned Colonel Jim Channon to research paranormal capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Stubblebine believed in abilities like passing through walls, based on the atomic structure of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Colonel Jim Channon**: Tasked with investigating paranormal phenomena, he returned after two years with a document called "Battalion of the First Earth," outlining protocols for paranormal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He is portrayed by Jeff Bridges in *The Men Who Stared at Goats* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Ingo Swann**: One of the first psychics used in the project, whose brain waves were studied to understand when he correctly perceived information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Uri Geller**: The famous illusionist participated in the first phase of the project, known for bending forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Geller, an Israeli army member, allegedly predicted the 1972 Munich massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Major Ed Dames**: A military participant who later became wealthy teaching remote viewing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He claimed to have found his wife using remote viewing and to have won lotteries and casino games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Joseph McMoneagle**: Another military participant in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Remote Viewing**: A technique developed to allow individuals to perceive information from a distance through drawings and extrasensory perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The hit rate for remote viewing was refined from 20% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The ultimate goal of the project was to develop skills like killing a goat just by staring at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Public Perception and Continuation**: The project was subject to a "Limited Hangout" where the CIA presented a small, downplayed version to the media, claiming a low success rate of 20% while hiding its true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The project was revived after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> and is believed to be in full force today, involving a "10th generation of paranormal soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Project MKUltra
Project MKUltra, an officially documented CIA mind control program, aimed to control behavior and even induce atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The "K" in MKUltra comes from the German word "Kontrol" (control), indicating its origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. It was revealed during the Church Commission in 1974, which investigated illegal CIA activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

*   **German Influence**: The project has roots in German research, notably from scientists brought to the US through Operation Paperclip, including figures like Joseph Mengele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Project Talent**: A sub-project under MKUltra, Project Talent aimed to create super soldiers through childhood trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The idea was to fragment a child's personality through extreme pain and psychological manipulation, often involving substances like LSD, to create multiple personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. One personality would be an ordinary individual, while another could be a "super assassin" or "sleeper agent" who doesn't consciously know their mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the "Manchurian Candidate" theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Allegations of Super Soldiers (Testimonies)

*   **Robert Duncan O'Finnean (codename "Del")**: Claims to have been a guinea pig in a super soldier project, experiencing strange nightmares and fragmented memories of combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. He discovered that his childhood memories were fabricated and that he was offered by his father (a secret agent) to Project Talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. O'Finnean claims to have implants in his brain, shoulder, and spine, which were revealed by MRI scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. He alleges that these implants, combined with spiritual forces, provide him with exceptional physical abilities, such as super strength, enhanced perception (seeing in slow motion), and the ability to "pass through walls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He believes he was a "receiver" who would receive telepathic commands from a "sender" psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. His story resembles plotlines from *The Bourne Identity* (for which he sued for plagiarism) and *Total Recall* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Prince (aka James Casbolt)**: A Canadian individual who also claims to have been a super soldier, used in a project called Operation Delta as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. He stated that Michael Aquino, a former US Army Lieutenant Colonel and leader of the Temple of Set, was responsible for "appeasing" [[conspiracy_theories_involving_possible_alien_involvement | aliens]] or Fallen Angels who worked with the American army in secret bases like Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## German Influence and Occultism
The search for super soldiers and mind control techniques by the US is closely tied to German research and [[paranormal_soldiers_and_occultism_in_world_war_ii | occult beliefs during World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

*   **Joseph Mengele's Experiments**: Joseph Mengele, a Nazi doctor, conducted horrific experiments aimed at developing super soldiers, with unlimited resources and "guinea pigs at will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Nazi Occult Beliefs**:
    *   **Aryan Race**: The Nazis, particularly Heinrich Himmler, invested heavily in supernatural and spiritual research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. They sought to justify the idea of a "German superior race" (Aryans) by reviewing history through Theosophy (Helena Blavatsky's teachings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. They believed Aryans were descendants of Atlantean civilizations and Nordic gods (Odin, Thor), possessing "Divine DNA" and exceptional skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Thule Society**: A secret society that played a role in developing these mystical concepts and trying to create paranormal soldiers and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Vril**: The concept of "Vril" was an energy believed to be spiritual, which could be mobilized to make Germans invincible, especially with access to certain sacred relics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Sacred Relics**:
        *   **Spear of Longinus**: Believed to have pierced Christ's side, Hitler immediately seized it upon invading Austria, believing it would make him invincible and establish a "thousand-year kingdom" (Third Reich) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
        *   **Ark of the Covenant**: Nazis, particularly Himmler, also actively sought the Ark of the Covenant, believing it would unleash divine power and allow them to mobilize "Vril" to create a weapon of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The power of the Ark is depicted in *Indiana Jones*, where those who gaze upon it perish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Racial Superiority**: The belief in being descendants of Atlantean "demigods" who ruled Earth before a cataclysm, provided a "divine right" justification for the Nazis to dominate the world and eliminate their perceived enemies (Semites, believed to be survivors of Atlantis's "other" lineage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Operation Paperclip**: After WWII, the US initiated Operation Paperclip, bringing top German scientists (including aerospace engineers like Wernher von Braun, who later founded NASA, and occultists like Joseph Mengele) to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This transfer of knowledge influenced US projects like MKUltra, particularly in the areas of mind and behavioral control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Other Related Concepts

*   **Montauk Project**: A purported series of top-secret US government experiments conducted at Montauk Air Force Station on Long Island, New York. It allegedly involved [[research_into_unexplained_phenomena | psychic research]], mind control, and even time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The project's antenna reportedly influenced the behavior of people in the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The project's "Montauk Chair" was said to enhance psychic abilities, allowing individuals to spy on distant locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. This project is linked to the Philadelphia Experiment, which allegedly involved making a ship invisible and teleporting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Acoustic Record**: A concept in which everything that happens in the universe is spiritually recorded, like a "blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. According to Chris Thomas, the Ark of the Covenant is the only thing capable of editing this record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **The Problem of Three Bodies**: This [[technological_advancements_and_global_control | science fiction series]] depicts an [[conspiracy_theories_involving_possible_alien_involvement | alien civilization]] interfering with human scientific advancement to prevent humanity from developing enough weapons to defend itself in a future war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. It creates a global elite to convince humanity that the aliens are saviors, while secretly hindering technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptos Conundrum**: A book by former CIA agent Chase Brandon, described as fiction but hinting at deeper truths, features a sculpture at the CIA headquarters with unsolved riddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The book's interpretation of the fourth riddle suggests an impending arrival of evil aliens who wish to destroy Earth, and that modern military spending is an excuse to prepare for this extraterrestrial threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This aligns with Elon Musk's interest in colonizing Mars as an escape from a potential disaster on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Satanic Panic**: A period in the US during the 1980s that saw widespread fear about alleged satanic cults involved in rituals and child abductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. A notable debate occurred between former FBI agent Ted Gunderson, who claimed these cults eliminated children in rituals, and Michael Aquino, an army officer and leader of the Temple of Set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Astrology in WWII**: Hitler reportedly used astrologers as consultants for military guidance, while British mystics, led by Dion Fortune, performed "psychic espionage" to counter these influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Fortune's rituals were said to bring fog to hinder German air attacks on Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **[[modern_technology_and_the_apocalypse | Future of Human Freedom and Control]]**: The discussions touch on the broader implications of advanced technology and potential control, aligning with themes of [[technological_advancements_and_global_control | global control]] and the [[future_of_human_freedom_and_control | future of human freedom]].

## Father Reginaldo Manzotti's Life and Priesthood Journey

Father Reginaldo Manzotti is a prominent Catholic priest whose journey into priesthood and subsequent innovative ministry has significantly impacted evangelization. His life reflects a deep [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | personal conversion and faith journey]], adaptability, and a commitment to spreading the Gospel through modern means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Early Life and Calling

Born to a deeply Catholic family, Father Manzotti describes his own birth as a "miracle from God" as his mother had him at 43, and he was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around him, initially not expected to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. His very religious mother, whose father was dedicated to charity and his mother to the apostolate of prayer, decided to have him baptized in the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. She promised that if he survived, he would be a tribute to Our Lady of Aparecida, hence his name Reginaldo Aparecido Manzotti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Despite his religious upbringing, he was a "naughty boy" who enjoyed playing and even stealing in his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. However, he was always involved in church activities, participating in the choir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. His calling to the priesthood began around age 11, inspired by his parish priest who played piano wonderfully and preached effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. He found a magazine with a question asking, "Do you want to be a priest?" and wrote to the seminary. To his surprise, a German priest arrived at his school one day to take him to the seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Seminary Life and Education

He entered the seminary at 11 or 12 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Seminary life was "bell-ruled," with strict timings for everything from waking up to meals and chapel visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While initially traumatized by the rigidity, he later appreciated it for instilling discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

His educational path included two faculties:
*   **Philosophy**: Three years of study, which he found "revolutionary" as it exposed him to diverse and "absurd" thoughts, transforming his perspective and grounding his thinking with logic and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. During this period, he was influenced by figures like Che Guevara and Axl Rose, highlighting his restless nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
*   **Theology**: Four years of direct study of God, preparing him for priesthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

A significant advantage of his seminary experience was studying externally at state schools and private colleges, which allowed him to have contact with people his age and avoid the "unreal world" of an internal seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This exposure was crucial for his future ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>.

During his discernment, he faced doubts, acknowledging that certainty isn't always present for a 12-15 year old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. He emphasizes that discernment is a two-way process, with the Church also assessing if a candidate truly has a vocation and is not entering as an "escape" from family issues, trauma, or other difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. He warns that those who seek priesthood out of disillusionment will be frustrated and harm the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>.

### Spiritual Journey and Influences

Father Manzotti initially held strong criticisms against the Charismatic Renewal, viewing it as a "delay" and associating himself with liberation theology, which interpreted all theology from the perspective of the excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. However, his perspective shifted dramatically after an "experience with the renewal" at a large Charismatic Renewal meeting, where he was "baptized in the Holy Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>. This marked a profound [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | conversion]] for him, confirming his path to priesthood with renewed fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>. He now identifies with the Charismatic Renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of unity among Christians, citing Pope St. John Paul II's document *Unitatis Redintegratio*, which encourages focusing on what unites different faiths rather than what separates them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This perspective highlights that true faith lies in charity and good attitudes, not in doctrines that divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Father Manzotti also touched upon significant changes in [[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | Catholic rituals and practices]], such as the shift from Latin Mass with the priest facing away from the congregation to vernacular Mass with the priest facing the people, following Vatican II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a>. These changes, initially met with resistance, aimed to make the Mass more accessible and emphasize the assembly's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:19">[02:29:19]</a>.

### Priesthood and Ministry Development

He was ordained a priest in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>. Early in his priesthood, he faced a crisis of identity, not a vocational crisis, after serving 13 years as a religious Carmelita priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:31">[02:38:31]</a>. He found community life rigid and felt frustrated when assigned to a wealthy school, feeling distant from his calling to reach more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:52">[02:39:52]</a>.

Inspired by Pope St. John Paul II's call to "evangelize with new ardor, with new methods," he sought innovative ways to reach people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:44">[02:40:44]</a>. His bishop, Dom Pedro Fedalto, helped him overcome this identity crisis by assigning him to a parish in the poor outskirts of Pinhais, which he called his "first love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:48">[02:42:48]</a>. There, he observed people's lack of enthusiasm for Mass and decided to infuse joy into the liturgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

This led to:
*   **Music Ministry**: He recorded his first CD with religious songs and used loudspeakers to play music, drawing people to Mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>. He incorporated modern instruments like guitar, drums, and keyboards, despite initial resistance from some traditional Catholics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:37">[02:45:37]</a>. He has since recorded 15 CDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:48">[02:46:48]</a>.
*   **Radio Ministry**: Invited to host a radio show, he started with a difficult 1 PM slot on an AM station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:13">[02:50:13]</a>. Through community engagement and adapting his content, his program became a hit, eventually moving to a prime 9 AM slot and being retransmitted by 1620 radio stations across Brazil, reaching an estimated 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:40">[02:52:40]</a>.
*   **Mass on TV**: He began celebrating Mass on open TV, initially skeptical but quickly adapting to the medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>.
*   **Evangelizing is Necessary Association**: Recognizing the need to acquire Catholic radio and TV licenses being lost to other groups, he founded the "Evangelizing is Necessary" association 17 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. This organization supports his media presence, with 166 TV repeaters and numerous radio retransmissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:31">[02:57:31]</a>. Beyond media, the association is deeply involved in charity, assisting 10,000 children monthly and supporting hospitals and nursing homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:14">[02:58:14]</a>.

### Ministry During Pandemic

The pandemic presented new challenges and opportunities for Father Manzotti's ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. He quickly adapted, emphasizing that the pandemic was not God's punishment but an allowance of human freedom, a corrective for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. He observed both the worst (stealing respirators) and the best (charity, family reconnection) of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>.

His team implemented creative initiatives:
*   **Photos in Pews**: As churches emptied, he asked people to send photos, which he printed and placed in the pews during Mass, making the empty church feel connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:46">[03:02:46]</a>.
*   **Drive-Thru Communion**: To allow people to receive the Eucharist safely, they organized drive-thru communion, with people driving up to receive it in their cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Drive-In Mass**: Masses were held in open spaces like quarries, where people parked and participated from their cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>.
*   **Solidarity Lives**: Inspired by country singers, he hosted live streams that collected 830 tons of food for those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:44">[03:05:44]</a>.

He noted that the pandemic led many people to convert or reconnect with religion, while others distanced themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:56">[03:08:56]</a>. He stresses the importance of humility, gratitude, and fighting individualism, as humanity shares a "common house" – the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:35">[03:09:35]</a>.

### Catholic Beliefs and Practices Explained

Father Manzotti provides insights into various [[catholic_beliefs_and_practices | Catholic beliefs and practices]]:

*   **Celibacy**: He explains that while celibacy is a value and not inherently evil, he believes the Church may open to married priests in the future, especially for already married men (known as "married men") as seen in the Orthodox Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. He shares his own personal dedication, noting that his demanding ministry would make marriage difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>.
*   **Exorcism**: He recounts a personal encounter with a possessed girl and explains the difference between obsession and possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. He clarifies that an exorcist needs special appointment by a bishop, extensive study, and a very serious spiritual life, as the work is physically and spiritually draining, often leading to early death from illnesses like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:50">[03:52:50]</a>.
*   **The Devil and Gaps**: He emphasizes that the devil is "tied up" but can attack if given "gaps" or permission through sins like drug addiction, betrayal, or anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:43">[03:11:43]</a>. He uses the metaphor of a house with cracks that the enemy exploits to ruin its foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:36">[03:49:36]</a>.
*   **Eschatology (Last Times)**: The Church believes humanity is in the "last stage of creation" between Christ's incarnation and His glorious return, called the second coming of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:24">[03:58:24]</a>.
*   **Judgment and Destinations**: Upon death, individuals face a "private judgment," where their life passes before them like a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:03">[04:01:03]</a>. The three possible destinations are:
    *   **Hell**: Not necessarily a physical fire, but the pain of absence of God's love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:12">[04:02:12]</a>. It's for those who deliberately denied God throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:12">[04:14:12]</a>.
    *   **Purgatory**: A state of purification for those who sought God but had imperfections, purging their impurities before entering heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Heaven**: For those in deep intimacy with God, like saints and the "good thief" on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:39">[04:05:39]</a>.
*   **Suicide**: The Church believes that suicides are not automatically condemned to hell, as intense pain often mitigates full awareness of the act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:44">[04:29:44]</a>. Acts of reparation, like charity and Masses, can help mitigate the severity for those who died in sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:37">[04:30:37]</a>.
*   **Children and Baptism**: Unbaptized children who die go to heaven, as God's justice includes mercy and they haven't made a deliberate denial of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:16">[04:16:16]</a>. He encourages infant baptism, believing it blesses children from birth with God's grace and makes them "daughters/sons of God" and members of the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Dogma**: He clarifies that a dogma is a truth believed by the Church since its origin, formalized by the Pope, rather than a new invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. He uses the Assumption of Our Lady as an example, where the Church has always believed Mary's body and soul were taken to heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:31">[04:48:31]</a>.
*   **Catholic Belief vs. Sola Scriptura**: Catholics believe in both the Word (Bible) and Tradition (practices and beliefs passed down by apostles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>, unlike Lutherans who adhere to "Sola Scriptura" (Scripture alone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:55">[04:52:55]</a>.

### Lessons and Legacy

Father Manzotti stresses the importance of confronting personal pain and seeking healing, as well as finding gratitude to overcome depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:13">[04:23:13]</a>. His anthem, "The Storm Will Pass," resonated deeply during the pandemic, reminding people that difficult moments are temporary and followed by "bonanza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:26">[04:26:26]</a>. He constantly strives to "evangelize by media, all forms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:41">[03:43:41]</a>, believing that his widespread reach allows his message to touch lives in unexpected corners of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

When asked about his biggest question for God, he states, "Why do innocent children suffer?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:10">[04:44:10]</a>—a question that even Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged not having a full answer to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:50">[04:48:50]</a>. Despite the challenges, Father Manzotti expresses deep happiness and contentment in his role as a "restless priest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>, committed to leading people to God and fostering a deep sense of connection and forgiveness. His epitaph would simply be: "See you soon. Hope to see you in heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>.

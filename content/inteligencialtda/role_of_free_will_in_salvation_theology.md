This article explores the theological debate between Calvinism and Arminianism, focusing on their differing views regarding [[calvinism_arminianism_and_free_will | free will]], God's sovereignty, and [[concepts_of_sin_and_salvation_in_christianity | salvation]]. The discussion features Marcos Granconato, a Calvinist pastor, and César Cavalcante, an Arminian pastor and theologian.

## Introduction to the Debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

The program "Limited Intelligence" hosted Rogério Vilera, who introduced Marcos Granconato, a Baptist Church pastor for 26 years, with a master's degree in ecclesiastical history, and César Cavalcante, a pastor in Campinas and director of the Bethesda Theological College, with a background in Christian apologetics and biblical Hebrew [03:48]. The debate's rules allowed audience questions for both sides [01:09].

## Defining Calvinism and Arminianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:20">[10:20:20]</a>

Arminianism originated with Jacob Arminius, who lived until 1609 and directed the University of Leiden in Holland [10:41]. Arminius, initially a Calvinist, developed difficulties with the more rigorous aspects of the [[doctrine_of_predestination_and_election | doctrine of predestination and election]] that emerged in 17th-century Calvinism, which emphasized election more heavily than even John Calvin's original writings [11:00]. Arminius believed this rigorous interpretation did not do justice to God's justice and character [12:18].

After Arminius's death, his followers presented a document outlining their disagreements with Calvinism. This led to the Synod of Dort (1618-1619) in the Netherlands, which established the "Five Points of Calvinism," also known by the acronym TULIP [12:41]:
*   **T**otal Depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45">[13:45]</a>
*   **U**nconditional Election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48">[13:48]</a>
*   **L**imited Atonement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>
*   **I**rresistible Grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53">[13:53]</a>
*   **P**erseverance of the Saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56">[13:56]</a>

Those who thought differently were barred from pastoral ministry, leading to Arminianism's development outside the Netherlands [13:05].

## Core Differences and Areas of Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31">[14:31]</a>

Both pastors emphasized that Calvinism and Arminianism are not inherently "enemies" and are not mutually exclusive [14:47]. They agreed that both traditions are considered orthodox, not heretical, and both affirm the Bible as the inerrant, infallible word of God [16:19]. What unites believers is the reality of believing in [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] as their Redeemer and Savior [15:59]. Jacob Arminius himself was a "holy man of God" with an "unblemished reputation" [16:47].

### The Scope of Christ's Death (Limited vs. Unlimited Atonement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22">[20:22]</a>

A significant point of contention is whether [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] died for everyone or only for a select group.

*   **Calvinist View (Marcos Granconato)**:
    *   [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] died for the elect, not for everyone [20:28].
    *   His death is effective *only* for the elect [22:10].
    *   The term "all" in biblical texts (e.g., Romans 11:32, 1 Corinthians 15:22, John 12:32, Colossians 1:28) often refers to "Jews and Gentiles" or a specific group, not necessarily every single individual [34:37], [35:56], [40:48], [48:16].
    *   The word "all" in the New Testament has "malleability" and does not always mean every human being on earth [49:09].
    *   Hebrews 2:9, stating [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] "tasted death for every man," was written to break Jewish exclusivism, not to imply salvation for all individuals [47:11]. This "every man" refers to men of all races, tribes, languages, and nations, as indicated by Hebrews 2:10 which mentions "many sons" [48:10].

*   **Arminian View (César Cavalcante)**:
    *   [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] Christ died for *all* people [32:21], [40:40], [55:39].
    *   This is a consistent biblical principle, and any theology denying it (like Calvinism) is problematic [32:21], [43:01].
    *   Romans 11:32 explicitly states God "shut them all up in disobedience, that he might have mercy on all" [33:34]. The word "all" appears twice, meaning all human beings [34:06].
    *   Hebrews 2:9, stating [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] "tasted death for every man," is clear and implies a universal sacrifice for all human beings [42:19], [42:47].
    *   Titus 2:11 confirms that "the grace of God has appeared, bringing [[concepts_of_sin_and_salvation_in_christianity | salvation]] for all people" [01:06:14].
    *   The offer of the Gospel is "honest" and "true" for all men [01:06:41].

### God's Love and Wrath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:07">[51:07]</a>

Another point of divergence lies in the nature and scope of God's attributes, particularly love and wrath.

*   **Calvinist View (Marcos Granconato)**:
    *   God *is* love, and His love is infinite [52:27], [54:36].
    *   However, God also has infinite wrath and justice [56:55].
    *   Biblical texts show God preparing "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" (Romans 9:22) and creating "the wicked for the day of trouble" (Proverbs 16:4) [55:05].
    *   These seemingly contradictory attributes (love and wrath) "harmonize in a way in [God's] mind that I don't know how to harmonize" [57:01]. This is an "insoluble theological tension" that humans cannot fully grasp because God's mind is "unfathomable, inscrutable" [01:17:02].
    *   To deny these texts is to "adulterate the Bible" [01:06:05]. God's wrath remains on those who reject [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | His Son]] [57:25].

*   **Arminian View (César Cavalcante)**:
    *   God loves *everyone* [51:21].
    *   A God who does not love everyone "is not the true God," because God's essence *is* love (1 John 4:8) [52:27].
    *   Anger is not the antonym of love; a loving parent can still be angry [01:00:06].
    *   The wicked are judged because they "rejected [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus Christ]] the love of Jesus Christ" [01:01:54].
    *   God's desire for all men to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) is "real" and "honest" [01:47:52].
    *   The account of the rich young ruler, whom [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] loved but who rejected [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Him]], illustrates that God's love is extended to all, even those not saved [03:05:37].

### Free Will, Human Responsibility, and Divine Sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>

This is the central point of contention, particularly concerning [[concepts_of_sin_and_salvation_in_christianity | salvation]].

*   **Calvinist View (Marcos Granconato)**:
    *   **Divine Sovereignty**: God determines all things, including human behavior, desires, and conscience [02:57:59]. Every detail, even the falling of a bird or the hairs on one's head, is "covered in the decree" [02:59:01].
    *   **Insoluble Tension**: There is a "paradox" or "insoluble theological tension" between God's absolute sovereignty and human responsibility [01:17:02].
    *   **Man's Will (not "Free Will")**: Adam, before the Fall, had "total free will" without inclination to sin [02:16:40]. After the Fall, human will became corrupted, leading to an inclination towards evil and disgust for holy things [02:16:55].
    *   "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (John 6:44) [01:08:00]. This means man cannot, on his own, desire holy things or prepare to receive them [02:18:06].
    *   "Free will" in its full sense (will free from corruption and external influence) is taught by Pelagians, not Calvinists [02:19:44].
    *   Calvinists believe in "will" (choice/decision), but this will operates "within a sphere called God's decree" [02:26:50]. This means humans are responsible for their actions, even if God has predetermined them [01:17:40]. The Bible states man is responsible *and* God is sovereign, and Paul does not resolve this tension logically in Romans 9 [01:17:15], [01:24:42].
    *   Those who are saved are "elected" according to God's foreknowledge, which for Calvinists, implies foreordination or choosing beforehand [02:52:00], [02:08:06]. Perseverance in faith is proof of election [01:53:51].

*   **Arminian View (César Cavalcante)**:
    *   **Free Will**: Free will is the "freedom to make decisions without coercion" [02:21:20].
    *   **Human Responsibility**: Human responsibility is "clear in the Holy Bible full time" [03:13:13], and this is only possible if man has freedom [03:12:56].
    *   **Synergism**: While [[concepts_of_sin_and_salvation_in_christianity | salvation]] is solely God's work (monergistic principle), God "calls us to participate synergistically of this process" (2 Corinthians 6:1) [01:11:01]. Man can "receive," "accept," and "extend the hand" to God's grace [01:13:06].
    *   **Adam's Fall**: Adam fell because he "wanted to" and had "100% free will" [02:23:12]. His responsibility and intention were 100% his own [02:23:30].
    *   **God's Foreknowledge**: God knows everything, including the future, because He is omniscient [03:23:51]. This "foreknowledge" means God *saw* what would happen, not that He *wrote* or *determined* it in the same way a Calvinist posits [02:25:46], [03:27:01]. If God determined Adam's fall, then God would be the ultimate author of sin [02:21:55].
    *   **Final Judgment**: A final judgment makes no sense in a Calvinist framework, because if man didn't choose his actions, he cannot be truly judged [01:15:06], [02:06:04]. However, man *is* judged according to his works, implying genuine choice [01:15:27].
    *   **Hardening of Hearts**: While God can harden hearts (e.g., Pharaoh, Israel in Deuteronomy 29:4), this occurs when people are *already* rebellious, not to create rebellion from neutrality [01:42:09], [03:22:42].
    *   **Prevenient Grace**: Arminians believe in "prevenient grace," which is God's grace preparing *everyone's* heart to receive the Gospel [02:00:47], [02:18:36]. This grace encompasses everyone who hears the Gospel [02:20:48].

The debate concluded with both pastors reiterating their positions, acknowledging the difficulty in reconciling divine sovereignty with human responsibility, a core tension in [[soteriology_and_theological_interpretations | soteriology]]. [03:10:01].

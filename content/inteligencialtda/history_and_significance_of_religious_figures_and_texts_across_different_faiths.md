## Introduction to Interfaith Dialogue
This discussion features a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Pastor, aiming to explore commonalities and unique aspects across their religions. The goal is to expand knowledge and bridge information between faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This format is described as [[challenges_and_interactions_within_and_between_different_religious_communities | inter-religious dialogue]], distinct from ecumenism, which refers to official church unity efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The importance of respectful dialogue is emphasized, aiming to find unity and communion despite differing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

## Core Concepts of Faith and God
### The Nature of God
All participants agree that there is one God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The Jewish view describes God as the omnipotent Creator, an infinite light, often beyond human comprehension, requiring faith even when understanding is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The concept of God's presence is central to Christianity, with the Bible mentioning "God is with us" over 3,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. In Catholicism, the divine presence is found in sacraments, understood as mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Christianity further describes God as a communion within Himself: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a "multiplicity in unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Judaism views this "partition" as "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Understanding Faith
Faith is defined as more than just belief or a code of truths; it is a relationship with the Creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. An "intelligent faith" involves a willingness "to read inside" oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. In Biblical Hebrew, there isn't a specific word for "faith" in the abstract sense; the closest is "firmness" (אמונה), meaning to "hold on" like someone drowning grabbing a floating trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:44">[02:47:44]</a>.

Latin theology distinguishes between:
*   **Doctrinal Faith (Fides Quae Creditur):** The set of beliefs or dogmas, such as fasting on Yom Kippur in Judaism, the Holy Sacrament in Catholicism, or the return of Jesus and Sabbath-keeping in Adventism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:53">[02:51:53]</a>.
*   **Relational Faith (Fides Qua Creditur):** The personal relationship with the Creator, which gives meaning to doctrinal beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:58">[02:58:58]</a>.

## Significant Religious Figures
### Abraham
[[religious_importance_of_jerusalem_to_judaism_christianity_and_islam | Abraham]] is central to Judaism, receiving a mission from God to "be blessed all peoples of the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>. His tests, especially the tenth (sacrificing his son Isaac), earned him the title of Patriarch of the people of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. His spiritual DNA is said to run in the veins of his descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:50">[02:57:50]</a>.

### Mary
Mary's [[historical_development_and_variations_in_christianity | virginity]] is a Catholic dogma with three levels: virgin before birth, during childbirth, and after childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The Adventist perspective interprets Mary as the "new Eve," believing that because Jesus had no sin, Mary did not experience the pains of childbirth, thus remaining a virgin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Moses
Moses's name is rooted in Egyptian, meaning "born of," often combined with a deity's name (e.g., Ramose). As Moses became aware of his Hebrew origins, he rejected the Egyptian deity, leaving only "Mousas" (Moses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:07">[02:17:07]</a>. After 40 years in the desert, he wrote the Torah in an embryonic alphabetic language, not hieroglyphics or cuneiform. This choice ensured the text would remain readable even when other ancient languages became dead, preserving the ability to read Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>.

### Jesus
For Christians, Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, who came as a humble "donkey" and will return in glory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:53">[03:01:53]</a>. The idea of "Christ crucified" was a "scandal to the Jews and madness for the gentiles" because the cross was a symbol of curse and extreme degradation in that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:51">[02:55:51]</a>. The name Jesus (Yeshua) means "the Lord Saves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. Judaism, however, does not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, viewing him as a wise man but not God's son in the Christian sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:02">[02:58:02]</a>.

### Saint Jerome
Saint Jerome (4th century) translated the Bible into Latin, creating the Vulgate (meaning "popular" or "common" Bible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:35">[02:13:35]</a>. He spent 40 years in a cave in Bethlehem, correcting existing poor translations and comparing Greek texts with original Hebrew manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:53">[02:14:53]</a>. He collaborated with a Jewish scholar to translate Hebrew texts, acknowledging the complexity of the task, particularly with books like Job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. His work made the Bible accessible to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:47">[02:13:47]</a>.

## Sacred Texts and Their Interpretations
### The Torah and Jewish Practice
The Torah is the core of Judaism, and its study is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>. Jewish law includes dietary rules (Kashrut), such as not mixing meat with milk and abstaining from pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:33">[03:30:33]</a>. Shabbat (Sabbath) observance begins at sunset on Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>. Jewish prayer is performed three times a day using stipulated words, but the internal experience of prayer is unique to each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. The name of God (יהוה) is often not pronounced out of respect, with alternatives like "Hashem" (The Name) or "Eloi" used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:52">[03:30:52]</a>.

### The Bible and Christian Interpretation
The Christian Bible, especially the New Testament, frequently mentions God's constant presence ("I am with you," "I am in the midst of you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>. The Christian liturgical day, like the Jewish, begins at sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:14">[01:40:14]</a>. Christian theology emphasizes that salvation is not merited by works but is a result of Christ's intercessory death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:14">[01:57:14]</a>. Works are seen as a result of salvation, not its cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:47">[01:58:47]</a>.

### Archeology and Biblical Accounts
[[history_of_science_and_notable_figures | Biblical archeology]] serves to explore the "infinite wisdom of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>. Discoveries like the Nebuchadnezzar brick in a museum in Brazil attest to the historicity of biblical episodes, such as the destruction of Solomon's Temple and the Babylonian captivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. Ancient Egyptian papyri, like the Ipuwer Papyrus, contain laments that describe events mirroring the biblical plagues in Egypt (Nile turning to blood, darkness, death of firstborn, departure of foreigners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

## Shared Themes and Divergences
### The "Longing for Paradise"
Across faiths, there's a deep-seated human "hunger for happiness" and a "longing for Paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:51">[03:13:51]</a>. This longing is seen as an unconscious memory of an original state and the soul's desire to return to its rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:19">[03:14:19]</a>. Life is viewed as a "corridor" leading to the "great hall" of the world to come, a stage for planting to reap later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. True happiness comes not from material success but from spiritual connection and living a life of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:11">[03:15:11]</a>.

### Eschatology (End Times)
[[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | Eschatology]], the study of final things, is a shared theme. Judaism awaits the coming of the Messiah (Mashiach), who will rebuild the Third Temple, gather all Jews to Israel, and bring world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. Christianity believes in the Second Coming (Parousia) of Jesus, who will return in glory to judge the living and the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:53">[03:01:53]</a>. The term "Adventist" itself means one who awaits the "advent" or coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:35">[03:00:35]</a>.

### Interfaith Harmony and Challenges
The discussion stresses the importance of mutual respect, acknowledging that while core beliefs may differ (e.g., Jesus as Messiah), dialogue can foster unity and communion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:52">[02:42:52]</a>. Examples of respectful interactions are given, such as a Catholic seminary accommodating Jewish dietary laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>, and a priest teaching at a non-Jewish school allowing a Jewish student to maintain their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>.

Historically, [[challenges_and_interactions_within_and_between_different_religious_communities | periods of conflict]] are acknowledged, such as anti-Semitism in medieval Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>, Luther's anti-Jewish sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>, and the Inquisition, which led many Jews to hide their identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:27">[01:56:27]</a>. However, there are also instances of heroism where people of different faiths helped save others during times of persecution, such as priests and pastors aiding Jews during the Holocaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>.

## Influence and Lessons from Diverse Faiths
Pope John Paul II's book "Crossing the Threshold of Hope" emphasizes learning from all religions. For example, Muslims offer a lesson in the assiduity of prayer, and Hinduism and Buddhism in personal balance and mind-body discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>. These are seen as "seeds of the verb" scattered throughout humanity's religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:33">[03:31:33]</a>. The ability to live with and not "cancel" or hate those who think differently is crucial for human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:12">[03:30:12]</a>.

The discussion highlights the idea that true knowledge helps one live with people who think differently without hating or exterminating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:12">[03:30:12]</a>. The pursuit of knowledge, as seen in figures like [[history_of_science_and_notable_figures | Isaac Newton]], who dedicated 70% of his writings to theology, demonstrates that science and religion are not necessarily in conflict but can mutually inform a deeper understanding of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:30">[03:20:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
The dialogue concludes with a message of hope and unity, emphasizing that despite doctrinal differences, there is a shared humanity and a common desire for connection and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:31">[03:33:31]</a>. The goal is not to convert others but to "enthusiastically witness" one's own beliefs, allowing others to agree or disagree without judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:25">[03:06:25]</a>. This approach fosters a deeper understanding and mutual respect, recognizing that "God does not take into account the time of ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:01">[03:35:01]</a> and that even those outside one's own faith can be good and faithful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:19">[03:36:19]</a>.

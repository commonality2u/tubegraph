International waters, also known as the high seas, are distinct from the territorial waters of countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:06">[05:31:06]</a>. A country's territorial sea extends 12 miles from its coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:04">[05:34:04]</a>, beyond which lies an economic exploitation zone of 200 miles where the coastal country has priority for exploration, such as oil drilling or fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:02">[05:40:02]</a>. Beyond these 200 miles, the area is considered [[international_waters_and_legal_implications | international waters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>.

## Legal Status and Challenges

[[international_waters_and_legal_implications | International waters]] are often described as "no man's land" because they do not belong to any single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:05">[06:11:05]</a>. This unique legal status means that, in some aspects, anyone can engage in activities like fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:31">[06:31:31]</a>.

### Jurisdiction for Crimes at Sea
If a crime is committed on a boat in [[international_waters_and_legal_implications | international waters]], the country of origin or the flag state of the boat is typically responsible for investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:04">[06:57:04]</a>. For example, if a boat flies the Brazilian flag, Brazil would investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:08">[07:05:08]</a>.

However, the vastness of the ocean, which occupies 70% of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:05">[07:17:05]</a>, presents significant challenges:
*   **Lack of Witnesses:** In [[international_waters_and_legal_implications | international waters]], there are often no witnesses to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:09">[07:04:09]</a>. This makes it a "perfect environment for a perfect crime" as there are no security cameras or independent testimonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:47">[08:11:47]</a>.
*   **Disappearance:** Individuals can disappear at sea without a trace, and their fate remains unknown due to the lack of witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:01">[08:26:01]</a>.
*   **Difficulty of Rescue:** Even with modern technology like GPS and satellites, finding a person or a small vessel adrift in the immense ocean is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:03">[08:52:03]</a>.

### Case Studies Illustrating Challenges

#### The Salvadoran Fisherman's Survival
In 2014, a Salvadoran fisherman named Jos√© Alvarenga survived 14 months adrift in the Pacific Ocean after his boat's engine failed during a storm off the coast of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:01">[09:42:01]</a>. He had no water or food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:08">[11:46:08]</a>. He survived by catching turtles, eating their flesh and blood, and collecting rainwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:28">[12:25:28]</a>. He also occasionally caught flying fish that landed in his boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:01">[12:53:01]</a>. His companion died after four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:07">[11:02:07]</a>. Alvarenga drifted across the Pacific, ending up in the Marshall Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:13">[14:05:13]</a>. Despite the advanced technology of the 20th century, no ship or satellite detected him during his ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:06">[17:27:06]</a>. Upon his return, he faced skepticism and accusations of cannibalism due to his survival in seemingly good condition, even undergoing a lie detector test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:06">[15:29:06]</a>.

#### Submersible Disasters
The recent implosion of a submersible attempting to visit the Titanic wreck highlights the dangers of deep-sea exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. The Titanic lies at a depth of nearly 4,000 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:04">[35:59:04]</a>, where pressure is immense (estimated at 300 atmospheres) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:09">[43:50:09]</a>. The submersible, despite having 20 cm thick walls of titanium and carbon fiber, likely imploded during its descent on Sunday morning, the day contact was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:05">[36:23:05]</a>. This suggests a structural failure caused by the extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:09">[44:50:09]</a>. Recovery of human remains from such an event is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>.

This incident also brings into question the commercialization of extreme expeditions, such as [[international_space_collaborations_and_conflicts | space tourism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a> and trips to Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. Critics argue that profit-driven expeditions might make concessions on safety standards compared to scientific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

The history of [[maritime_disasters_and_incidents | submarine disasters]] also illustrates the difficulties. For example, the Kursk submarine, a Russian military vessel, sank in 2000 due to an internal problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Despite initial refusals for international assistance from Russia, all 119 crew members eventually died, likely from gas leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. Another case is the Argentinian submarine San Juan, which disappeared in 2017 with 44 crew members and was only found a year later due to challenging underwater terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>.

## Other Maritime Phenomena and Stories

### The Vastness and Danger of the Sea
The sea is incredibly vast, leading to many bizarre stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. It's also the designated "Point Nemo" for discarding old spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:05">[08:01:05]</a>. The sheer size makes it difficult for urban dwellers to grasp its immensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:06">[08:27:06]</a>.

*   **Shipping Accidents:** Thousands of shipping containers fall into the sea each year, posing navigational hazards, as they can float or become semi-submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>.
*   **Crazy Waves:** These are unpredictable, abnormally large waves that can appear suddenly, sometimes referred to as "rogue waves." They can capsize ships and are difficult for science to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:15">[03:08:15]</a>.

### Historical and Modern Narratives
*   **Shipwrecks:** The Titanic, while famous, was not the deadliest shipwreck in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>. It sank due to an iceberg, breaking into two parts on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
*   **Ghost Ships:** These are vessels found adrift with no crew or bodies, leading to intriguing mysteries about what happened to those on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>. One such case is the Mary Celeste, which was found completely abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:31">[02:08:31]</a>.
*   **The Bermuda Triangle:** This area is widely believed to be a mysterious zone where planes and ships disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:12">[03:11:12]</a>. However, the expert states that this is pure fiction, and disappearances in the region are not supernatural, but rather due to weather conditions or accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:57">[03:50:57]</a>. The term was created by a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16">[01:39:16]</a>.
*   **Undiscovered Treasures:** Due to centuries of maritime trade and piracy, it's highly probable that many valuable treasures, including gold and silver, lie undiscovered at the bottom of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:03">[04:11:03]</a>. Laws in many countries, like Brazil, deem such finds property of the state, discouraging reporting by those who find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>.
*   **Human Endeavor and Recklessness:**
    *   **Remarkable Crossings:** Adventurers have undertaken incredible feats, such as a Frenchman who crossed the Atlantic in a barrel, relying solely on ocean currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>.
    *   **Modern Vikings:** A group of Norwegian sailors, known as "Modern Vikings," embarked on an expedition to Antarctica in a sailboat, aiming to reach the South Pole on quad bikes for a documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. Their sailboat disappeared during a storm, leading to accusations against the New Zealand Navy for allegedly forcing the boat out of a sheltered bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
    *   **The Prince of Asturias:** This Spanish transatlantic liner, considered Brazil's "Titanic," sank off Ilhabela in the early 20th century, resulting in many deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.
    *   **Bateau Mouche Tragedy:** In Brazil, the *Bateau Mouche* ferry capsized on New Year's Eve in 1988, largely due to human irresponsibility, overcrowding, and lack of inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:39">[03:00:39]</a>. No one was punished for the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Recent Disappearances:** A Santos sailor recently disappeared in Santos Bay while testing new equipment on his sailboat, with neither him nor his boat ever found, despite extensive searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>. These disappearances highlight the ongoing mysteries of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>.

The sea, with its immense power and unpredictable nature, demands respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:29">[03:25:29]</a>. While technology has advanced, preventing all accidents remains challenging, and human recklessness often plays a significant role in [[maritime_disasters_and_incidents | tragedies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:06">[03:39:06]</a>.

Emerson Ceará, a prominent comedian, embarked on a significant journey from his home in the Northeast of Brazil to find success in Curitiba, Paraná <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His path was marked by accidental detours, tough living conditions, and a strong will to adapt and survive.

## Accidental Arrival in Londrina

In 2006, at the age of 18, Emerson was looking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. A friend "delivered" him to Londrina to work as a peddler, promising a minimum wage of R$360, which was considered significant at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Emerson mistakenly believed Londrina was a city in Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Without a cell phone or internet access at the time, his information was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Upon receiving his ticket, he realized it was for Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais, and he needed additional money to reach Londrina, Paraná <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Despite the confusion and the realization he was heading to a much more distant place, his friend's promise of a waiting job and a planned arrival made him feel he had no choice but to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### Life as a Peddler
Upon arrival in Londrina, Emerson faced extreme hunger, resorting to eating orange and banana peels for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. A kind woman eventually offered him food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. He joined a sales team living in a house with eight other peddlers, some of whom had criminal backgrounds, making the living situation quite challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. He learned to adapt by lying to survive and earn favors, cooking for his housemates, and even doing their laundry to gain their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Moving to Curitiba and Early Jobs

Emerson moved to Curitiba because his company had an opening in their sales team there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. He chose to stay in Curitiba because he didn't want to return to Ceará, as he felt there were no opportunities for him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. He lived with an older woman, Vera, who was 30, while he was 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. They dated briefly and lived together for five years, and her daughter even became the godmother at his wedding years later, indicating a lasting, kind friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

He took on odd jobs like bricklayer's assistant and painter's helper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. His dream was to work a "clean" job, such as a waiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

### Pizzeria Waiter
While working as a bricklayer for a pizzeria, Emerson saw a sign for a waiter position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. He lied about his experience, claiming to have worked at various restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. He convinced the owner to hire him, promising to learn quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. On his second day, he accidentally set a feijoada buffet on fire due to his inexperience with the heating method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. Despite the mishap, he wasn't fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

### Transition to Comedy and Bartending
At the pizzeria, Emerson met Ramos Neto, who was opening a comedy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. He was invited to work as a cook, but when he arrived for the interview, he lied again, claiming to be a bartender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. He spent the night before his first shift learning classic drinks on Google at a LAN house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. On opening night, he was overwhelmed but was eventually told to just serve beer and soda while the more experienced bartenders handled complex drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. He would arrive early each day to be taught how to make drinks, eventually becoming the "Big Chef" (head bartender) at the bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

## Building a Comedy Career

Working at the comedy bar exposed him to stand-up comedy, a form he initially knew little about, only recognizing older comedians from TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. His boss, Joca, encouraged him to try stand-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. His first attempt was a disaster, telling a nonsensical cat joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. However, he learned from feedback, shifting from random topics to telling jokes based on his own life and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

He often performed as a "comedian waiter" after the main shows, which encouraged audience consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. He even admitted to hoping the main comedian's show would be bad so more people would stay to watch him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. This period also highlighted the subtle prejudices within the comedy scene, where a waiter performing comedy might be undervalued or seen as less legitimate than established comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Regional Differences
Emerson faced criticism for his use of profanity in his early acts, which he later adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. He also navigated the "clique" or "pot" mentality in the comedy scene, where established groups might unintentionally or intentionally exclude newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. His biggest challenge was the lack of support or mentorship from more established comedians, forcing him to build his material alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

He notes the difference in audience reception between Curitiba and São Paulo; in Curitiba, audiences preferred a conversational approach before jokes, while in São Paulo, quick jokes were expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>. He adopted the Curitiba style of engaging the audience first, which he found changed his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>.

## Journey to National Recognition
Emerson's big break came with an invitation to the *Faustão* television show, a significant step in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. He had to undergo a test to appear on the show, which he passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. Although he ultimately "lost" the competition, he was hired by Globo for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. This exposure, combined with his strategic use of social media (Facebook and later YouTube) to promote his videos, helped him gain significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. He invested heavily in boosting his videos, taking a loan to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. This investment paid off within four months, showcasing his determination and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.

His journey from being a peddler in Londrina to a successful comedian highlights his resilient spirit and ability to adapt to new environments and challenges, proving that [[survival_and_adaptation_outside_brazil | migration and adaptation]] are key elements in achieving success.

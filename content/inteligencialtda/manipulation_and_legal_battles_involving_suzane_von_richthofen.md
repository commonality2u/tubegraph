Suzane von Richthofen, a notable figure in [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_Brazil | high-profile crime cases in Brazil]], has been the subject of extensive public scrutiny, particularly regarding her post-conviction life, legal challenges, and psychological profile. Her case highlights various [[legal_nuances_in_high_profile_crime_convictions | legal nuances in high-profile crime convictions]] and the complexities of criminal rehabilitation and public perception.

## Post-Conviction Life and Public Reintegration

Upon becoming eligible for semi-open regime, Suzane needed a fixed address to be granted temporary exits from prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This led to her connection with Rogério Olberg, a relative of her cellmate Luciana Hostel, through a photo shown by Luciana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Suzane expressed interest in Rogério, leading to them starting a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

The author, while researching for a book, investigated the Olberg family, who welcomed Suzane during her exits. The investigation suggested the family was financially motivated, as contact with them often required purchases or services, such as skin cleanings from Rogério's sister, Josiele, or crafts from Rogério <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Legal Battles Over Media Coverage

Following an article published in *Época* magazine alleging the Olberg family's financial interest in Suzane, Rogério and Josiele sued the author, seeking to prevent further discussion about them in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This type of legal action is common among those who host Suzane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

Suzane herself has initiated several lawsuits related to her image and privacy:
*   **Against TV Globo:** She won a lawsuit in the first instance against TV Globo for broadcasting her psychological exams on the program *Fantástico* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   **Against the State:** She sued the state, claiming it failed to protect her image as a prisoner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   **Against Book Publication:** She attempted to prevent the publication of a book about her before its release, arguing it would damage her image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. She lost this case because she sought prior censorship without knowing the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Her argument that the book would tarnish her image was seen as an "inversion of values," given the brutality of her crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

The motivation for prisoners to share their stories or engage with media is often financial, as they are left with little money upon release from long sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Suzane reportedly received R$120,000 for an interview with Gugu Liberato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This raises questions about whether "crime pays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Psychological Profile and Manipulative Behavior

Suzane's psychological assessments, as revealed in her criminal execution process, describe her as manipulative, highly seductive, and possessing camouflaged aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. These traits are evident in her interactions:

*   **Manipulating Evaluators:** Psychologists have noted her ability to manipulate and seduce evaluators, which may influence her psychopathy diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Remorse:** Unlike Daniel Cravinhos, who showed immediate remorse for the crime, Suzane's remorse is not seen as genuine by external experts. Her expressions of regret focus on how the crime negatively impacted her own life, not the victims' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>.
*   **Calculated Coldness:** Suzane remained cold and unshaken throughout the investigation and reconstruction of the crime. The delegate noted she never shed a tear, even during her confession or when under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>. She even hosted a birthday party shortly after her parents' funeral, leading investigators through the crime scene as if it were a tourist guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>.
*   **Convenient Religion:** Her religious conversions within prison (Lutheran, Catholic, Spiritist, Candomblé, Evangelical) were often self-serving, used to seek protection or achieve specific goals, such as escaping a prisoner threatening her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>.

### Rorschach Test Findings

The Rorschach inkblot test, used in her psychological evaluations for parole, aims to reveal unconscious feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>. Suzane's responses to the inkblots, such as seeing "skeleton jaws," "calyx," and "flower" in patterns, combined with her verbalized remorse primarily for her own destroyed life, led psychologists to conclude she is manipulative and narcissistic with camouflaged aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The tests also indicate a possibility of renewed aggression if faced with environmental pressures or obstacles to her demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:35">[01:58:35]</a>.

## Imprisonment and Incidents

Suzane's time in prison has been marked by various incidents:
*   **Rebellion Attempt:** At one point, other inmates at a women's penitentiary, particularly one from a "satanic sect" who claimed the devil wanted Suzane's soul, rebelled and attempted to kill her due to her parricide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:29">[02:46:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:35">[02:48:35]</a>. Prison staff, including a guard and a doctor, reportedly hid her in an iron closet to protect her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.
*   **Transfers:** She was subsequently transferred to Rio Claro Penitentiary, and later to Ribeirão Preto, where she again encountered the same threatening inmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:58">[02:50:58]</a>.
*   **Harassment Complaint:** A prosecutor, who appeared to have a "crush" on Suzane and affectionately called her "Suzy," offered to arrange her transfer to Tremembé in exchange for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:41">[02:51:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:56">[02:52:56]</a>. Suzane agreed, but after the transfer was secured, she filed a harassment complaint against him, leaving the prosecutor without the "kiss" and facing internal disciplinary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:49">[02:55:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:14">[02:56:14]</a>.

## Public Perception and Prognosis

Despite the public fascination with her story, many Brazilians believe there is no forgiveness for Suzane's crimes, with some wishing for life imprisonment or even the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. However, her case is viewed as unique, linked to her specific personal history and family dynamics, rather than a general propensity for violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:11">[02:29:11]</a>.

Regarding her potential for future crime, while it's difficult to predict, it's considered unlikely she would commit another crime of the same magnitude, as her previous acts were related to specific personal and familial circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:30">[02:39:30]</a>. Psychological reports indicate her behavior depends on environmental demands and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:35">[02:58:35]</a>.

> "When she starts to go out, society needs to know if it is and to return to live in society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:18">[01:42:18]</a>
> "I don't believe she committed a crime again, Suzane's reports say that they have to be variable pressure, environment, a demand but still I I find it difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>

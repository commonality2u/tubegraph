Biblical prophecy, particularly concerning the [[end_times_and_revelations | end times]] and the Book of Revelation, is a subject of significant study and varied [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | interpretation]] within Christian theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The Bible is considered a consistent book, and its interpretation, known as hermeneutics, follows specific rules, such as interpreting obscure texts in light of clear ones, and ensuring the Bible does not contradict itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:31">[02:43:31]</a>.

## The Book of Revelation
The book of Revelation is presented as a [[prophetic_visions_and_endtimes_prophecy | prophecy]] and the word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. It is described as a highly symbolic book that needs to be interpreted from that perspective, rather than always literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>.

### Context and Purpose
The Book of Revelation was written by John, the last living Apostle of Jesus, around the year 96 A.D., during the severe persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Domitian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>. John was deported to the volcanic island of Patmos, a penal colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>. The book is God's revelation to John, showing him "things that must happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>. Its symbolic language was intended for a people being massacred, tortured, and martyred, allowing believers to understand its message while obscuring it from enemies of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>.

The central truth of Revelation is the victory of Christ and His church in His second coming and at the final judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:57">[02:07:57]</a>. The book is not a rectilinear progression from point A to B, but rather structured into seven parallel and progressive sessions, each emphasizing the same central truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:40">[02:07:40]</a>.

### Structure and Sessions
The Book of Revelation can be summarized into seven main sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>:
1.  **The Seven Candles / Seven Churches** (Chapters 1-3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.
2.  **The Seven Seals** (Chapters 4-7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:15">[02:08:15]</a>: These depict the persecution of the world by the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:21">[02:08:21]</a>.
3.  **The Seven Trumpets** (Chapters 8-11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:25">[02:08:25]</a>: Represent God's partial judgment on the world that persecutes the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>. The "one-third" judgment signifies that judgment is mixed with mercy, calling for repentance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.
4.  **The Evil Quartet** (Chapters 12-14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:57">[02:08:57]</a>: Includes the dragon, the antichrist, the false prophet, and Babylon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
5.  **The Seven Bowls of God's Wrath** (Chapters 15-16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:14">[02:09:14]</a>: This signifies full, complete judgment, with no chance for reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:17">[02:09:17]</a>.
6.  **The Downfall of the Evil Quartet** (Chapters 17-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a>: The fall of Babylon, the false prophet, and the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:28">[02:09:28]</a>.
7.  **The Final Judgment** (Chapters 20-22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>: Features the release of the devil, death, and those not in the Book of Life into the Lake of Fire, followed by new heavens and a new Earth for the saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:44">[02:09:44]</a>.

### Key Symbols and Interpretations
*   **Seven Seals**: Each seal, when opened, signifies an emerging problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:13">[02:10:13]</a>.
    *   **First Seal (White Horse)**: Represents Christ, not the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:34">[02:10:34]</a>. The color white is never used for the devil or antichrist, and Christ is the only one who goes out "conquering and to conquer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:58">[02:10:58]</a>.
    *   **Second Seal (Red Horse)**: Symbolizes wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:22">[02:11:22]</a>.
    *   **Third Seal (Black Horse)**: Denotes hunger and scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:29">[02:11:29]</a>.
    *   **Fourth Seal (Yellow Horse)**: Represents death and hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:36">[02:11:36]</a>.
    *   **Fifth Seal**: Depicts souls in heaven crying for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:42">[02:11:42]</a>.
    *   **Sixth Seal**: Signifies the Second Coming of Christ, characterized by celestial disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.
*   **The Dragon**: Symbolizes the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>.
*   **The Antichrist**: Described as the "man of lawlessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. The Devil seeks to imitate God, so the antichrist will be a kind of incarnation of Satan, performing a simulacrum of resurrection and seeking to mark his followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>. He will appear human but will possess supernatural power from the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>. All who dwell on Earth will worship him, except those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:35">[02:21:35]</a>. True believers will not be deceived or worship the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:45">[02:21:45]</a>.
*   **The Great Harlot / Babylon**: This is not a person, but a corrupt political, religious, and economic system that serves the interests of the powerful to oppress the weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:20">[02:45:20]</a>.

## The Second Coming of Christ
Jesus' [[prophetic_visions_and_endtimes_prophecy | prophetic sermon]] in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 addresses the destruction of the temple and the [[end_times_and_revelations | end of times]] / second coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Signs of the End Times
The signs of the [[end_times_and_revelations | end times]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>:

*   **Cooling of love**: A decrease in compassion and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>.
*   **Global preaching of the Gospel**: Enabled by technologies like the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:05">[01:58:05]</a>.
*   **Apostasy**: Many churches abandoning true doctrine and turning to liberalism, leading to a focus on prosperity theology rather than the pure Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:33">[01:58:33]</a>.
*   **Global agenda**: The deconstruction of Judeo-Christian values, setting the stage for the appearance of the "man of iniquity" (antichrist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:09">[01:59:09]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Second Coming
The Second Coming of Christ is characterized by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>:
*   **Personal**: Jesus himself will return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>.
*   **Visible**: Every eye will see Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:14">[02:16:14]</a>.
*   **Audible**: Accompanied by a command, the voice of an Archangel, and the trumpet of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>.
*   **Sudden**: Like lightning stretching from east to west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:26">[02:16:26]</a>.
*   **Unexpected**: Like a thief in the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:35">[02:16:35]</a>.
*   **Inescapable**: No authority can cancel this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:45">[02:16:45]</a>.
*   **Victorious**: Christ will put all enemies under His feet, sit on the throne, and judge the nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:53">[02:16:53]</a>.

### Rapture Theories and Millennial Views
There are four major currents of [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | interpretation]] regarding the [[biblical_eschatology_and_prophecy | biblical eschatology]] of Christ's second coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:56">[02:13:56]</a>:
*   Amillennialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:03">[02:14:03]</a>
*   Postmillennialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:07">[02:14:07]</a>
*   Historic Premillennialism (post-tribulationist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:09">[02:14:09]</a>
*   Dispensational Premillennialism (pre-tribulationist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>

It's important to note that these are not fundamental doctrines, but rather currents of thought about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:30">[02:14:30]</a>. Key doctrines include Jesus' return, the resurrection of the dead, final judgment, and the existence of heaven and hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:36">[02:14:36]</a>.

The idea of a **secret rapture** (pre-tribulationist view), where believers suddenly disappear before a period of tribulation, has no biblical basis in the New Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:50">[02:15:50]</a>. The New Testament does not support the idea that the church will avoid the great tribulation; rather, it indicates the church will face it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. The concept of a seven-year tribulation also lacks a literal biblical basis, as seven is primarily a symbolic number of completeness in Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:41">[02:19:41]</a>.

From an Amillennial perspective, the signs of the [[end_times_and_revelations | end times]] (religious deception, wars, earthquakes, famines, epidemics, cooling of love, persecution, apostasy) are eloquent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>. Jesus will return personally and visibly, sit on the throne, judge the nations, and usher in new heavens and a new Earth, marking the end of history and the beginning of eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>.

## Prophecy and Free Will
God's foreknowledge of events, including human sin, does not negate human responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. While God knew that man would fall and had a plan of redemption before creation, mankind is still responsible for its choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

For example, Judas was 100% responsible for his actions, despite his betrayal fulfilling [[biblical_prophecies_and_their_fulfillments | prophecy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:41">[01:45:41]</a>. Judas was a free being who made his own wrong decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:43">[01:50:43]</a>. Satan can influence and induce, but he does not control human will directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>. Similarly, the crucifixion of Christ, though plotted by men, was part of a divine plan to defeat the enemies of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:37">[01:44:37]</a>.

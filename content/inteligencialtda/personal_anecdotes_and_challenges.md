The program "Limited Intelligence" hosted by Rogério Vilela, often brings together individuals "smarter, more interesting and with life much funnier" than the presenter himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The discussion delves into the guest's [[personal_anecdotes_and_insights_from_a_comedians_career | personal anecdotes and insights from a comedian's career]], highlighting various [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | personal anecdotes and challenges]] faced throughout their life and career.

## Early Life and Family Influences

The guest, Tom Cavalcante, recalls his earliest memories of comedy watching Oscarito and Jerry Lewis on black and white television around age 10, finding their antics "really funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Later, discovering that Chico Anysio and Renato Aragão were from his home state of Ceará, sparked his curiosity in comedy around ages 16-17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

His father, a salesman, influenced his childhood by bringing home various collections and books, leading to a "childhood full of reading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. He also worked at a laboratory, exposing Tom to many medicine names, which he sometimes references in his shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. His father was an "extroverted guy" who could tell jokes better than him, a "potential artist" who gathered friends to listen to his stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. His father lived a long and fulfilling life, enjoying wines and playing games, and expressed his fulfillment in seeing his son's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Childhood Trauma and Transformation
A significant turning point in Tom's life was the sudden death of his mother when he was 13 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The experience was "very shocking" for a child, as he was pulled in to see the coffin without fully understanding what was happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. His mother's death was quick, due to cancer, and she "suffered so much in silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Her last request was to be buried in the clothes of Saint Francis, embodying a "vow of poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

This loss marked a turning point where he "start[ed] to understand that [he has] to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. He chose to "be happy" and began making jokes and playing with life, developing a "potential rejection of death like no one else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. He later needed therapy to process this loss, as his mind struggled with it until he was about 27 or 28 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

After his mother's passing, his family experienced financial difficulties, leading him to live with various relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This nomadic journey contributed to the birth of his first character, "Marcelo," a name given to him by local football players in a new neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. For years, many people still called him "Marcelo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

## Path to Comedy and Television

His foray into comedy began with acting in church youth groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, where he enjoyed speaking into the microphone and receiving compliments on his voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Though shy in everyday life, the stage gave him strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

He spent about 16 years involved in football, playing in youth teams and attending stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. It was during this time, observing stadium announcers, that he started imitating them at school and on the field, which sparked his interest in radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. He would approach radio stations, eventually getting a chance at FM Aruana, where he was given the name "Tom Cavalcante" by João Inácio Junior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

His early radio career involved working late-night shifts and studying English intensely, as advised by a station manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Simultaneously, he worked as a newspaper proofreader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. He started performing small comedy shows at beach huts in Fortaleza, incorporating imitations of artists like Gilberto Gil and Fagner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. His first paid gig, singing parodies, was initially met with skepticism by the owner, who thought he was "dubbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

His reputation grew, leading to performances at popular bars and being encouraged by artists like Fagner and Belchior to move to Rio de Janeiro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Traveling was difficult due to limited and expensive flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

### The Road to Rede Globo
A major inspiration was seeing a show by Sergio Leite, which ignited a "very strong desire" to pursue humor professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. He quit football and began his pursuit of television.

His journey to Globo was protracted, spanning from 1982 to 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, marked by "a blind flight of attempts" with no direct connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. He learned about educational TV modules presented by young people and started doing them, initially speaking Portuguese for class modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

His persistence eventually led to a crucial encounter with Chico Anysio. He recorded a commercial for Chico's show, hoping it would be a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. An unexpected encounter with a neighbor who was Chico's cousin's secretary led him to Chico's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Despite an initial cold reception from Chico's cousin, he eventually managed to meet Chico himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.

When he met Chico Anysio, he confessed his desire to be a comedian. Chico's response was direct: "it depends on you brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. He presented a tape of his voices and characters, which greatly impressed Chico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Chico then told him, "I want to work with me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, asking him to report to Globo in Rio in February 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

The journey to Rio was fraught with challenges, including a flight on an instruction plane that broke down and a 7-hour delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. Upon arrival, he faced further obstacles at Globo's reception, as no one believed he had a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. He fabricated stories about working for Chico and returning to Rio, even lying about a contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

His determination was further aided by Fagner and Zico, who helped him finally get a direct meeting with Chico Anysio, who was surprised he had not appeared earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Chico then gave him a mission to write for two characters, and with the help of journalist Nonato Albuquerque, he submitted scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This led to his official entry into Globo and the "Escolinha do Professor Raimundo" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>, where he developed the character João Canabrava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.

### The Impact of "Sai de Baixo"
After the "Escolinha," Tom joined "Sai de Baixo" as Ribamar, a doorman character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. The show's creators allowed him to be free in his performance, leading to dynamic improvisations and interactions with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. He learned a great deal from working with Miguel Falabella, especially his improvisational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.

The show was a massive success, even credited with a decrease in suicide rates in São Paulo at the time, as it offered "happy Sunday night" entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">[01:40:27]</a>. This highlights the important role of humor in providing consciousness and critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>.

## Career Transitions and [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | Transformation]]

After four years on "Sai de Baixo," Tom received an offer to host "Mega Tom," a daily show, which meant leaving "Sai de Baixo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:12">[01:43:12]</a>. This decision caused "malaise" within the team, and he admits that with more maturity, he would have handled the political aspect differently, by communicating with his colleagues first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>.

He then moved to Record TV, an "irrefutable" offer that provided creative freedom and allowed him to build a large team of comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. This move challenged the perception that leaving Globo would end his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:29">[02:52:29]</a>. He described the daily routine as "very heavy" but thrived in the fast-paced, live environment, producing a different show every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>. He even integrated sensitive topics like LGBTQ+ beauty contests and controversial figures like Clodovil into his shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:55">[01:58:55]</a>.

After six years at Record, he decided to leave, informing the network a year in advance despite facing a hefty contractual fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:20">[02:01:20]</a>. He paid the fine to leave before suffering a "Burnout," which would have led to a decline in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. He spent a year in Los Angeles, studying cinema, financing his own film, and learning about the American film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>. He recognized the challenges for Brazilians in the American market but appreciated the industry's organization and respect for union rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>.

## Modern Day and Reflections
During the pandemic, he learned to use the internet and started creating his own videos, gaining insights into online humor and even bombing political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:14">[03:33:14]</a>. He noted the growing trend of monetization through online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:52">[03:13:52]</a>.

Tom reflects on the changing landscape of humor, noting that what was acceptable 10-20 years ago may not be today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>. He emphasizes that humor's function is to help "gain consciousness" and report on societal behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>. He also acknowledges the growing rudeness online, where people feel protected to say anything, contrasting it with face-to-face interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.

He continues to perform live shows, emphasizing the importance of preparation and discipline to feel "free" on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:53">[03:08:53]</a>. He studies his shows for "8 hours a day" to ensure a safe and entertaining performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:25">[03:09:25]</a>.

One of his greatest joys is the continued affection from his fans, even from different generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. He recalled a heartwarming moment where a young girl recognized him as "Didi" (from Trapalhões), highlighting the enduring legacy of classic Brazilian comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>.

Tom maintains a deep faith, believing in "beings of light" and praying for guidance through life's uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:43">[03:23:43]</a>. He expresses significant concern about the social and political injustice in Brazil, hoping for greater stability for those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:17">[03:24:17]</a>. His hardest life moment remains the loss of his mother at 13, which was a "very painful break" that marked his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:08">[03:21:08]</a>.

From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The intersection of mythology and religion has profoundly shaped historical events, beliefs, and societal structures, often leading to interpretations that deviate significantly from original narratives or spiritual revelations. The speaker highlights how religious institutions have historically manipulated narratives to consolidate power and control, influencing everything from biblical interpretations to the perception of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

## Biblical Events and Their Historical Interpretations

### The "Lost Years" of Jesus

The Bible provides no mention of Jesus' life between the ages of 14 and 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Speculation, often rooted in spiritual revelation, suggests that Jesus may have traveled to India during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. While not officially stamped as true by religious institutions, these spiritual revelations offer alternative perspectives on his formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The traditional biblical narrative describes a significant event when Jesus, around 9-11 years old, was left behind in Jerusalem by Mary and Joseph during a pilgrimage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. They found him in the Sanhedrin, listening to and questioning the doctors of the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In this account, Jesus famously stated his purpose was to take care of his father's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This passage, from the Gospel, contrasts with later "spiritual gossip" that elaborates on Jesus' inquiries about a figure named "Hackman" who supposedly "fixed some things that God had done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Joseph of Arimathea and Jesus' Travels

According to "spiritual gossip," Jesus' father, Joseph, sought out his wealthy client, Joseph of Arimathea, to inquire about "Hackman" mentioned in the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Years later, Joseph of Arimathea, a scholar of both Jewish and Greco-Roman mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, hired Jesus to manage his caravans traveling to various parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This allowed Jesus to travel to places like Persia, India, and Egypt between the ages of 16 and 25, seeking answers to his profound questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

Mary, Jesus' mother, is said to be a descendant of the Benj Gala Tribe, which migrated from ancient Gaul (modern-day France) to Palestine, giving the region its name "Galilee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This lineage connects to the schism of the 12 tribes of Israel, where the northern ten tribes, including Benjamin, were dispersed by the Assyrian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### The Evolution of Jesus' Image and the Suppression of Narratives

The narrative surrounding Jesus' life transformed significantly after his death. The speaker identifies three "faces" of Jesus:
1.  **Jesus the Galilean:** Created by the 11 remaining Apostles (excluding Judas Iscariot), who intended his message to be passed on only to Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
2.  **Jesus the Christian (or Marvel Superstar):** Invented by Paul of Tarsus, who, after a vision of the resurrected Jesus, began spreading Christianity to the rest of the world, contrary to the Apostles' original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Paul also introduced concepts like "salvation" and "justification by faith" that Jesus never explicitly taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. The term "Christ" (anointed one) itself appeared only after Jesus' death, coined by Paul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
3.  **Jesus the Living One:** This figure emerged through new revelations given by the resurrected Jesus to a group of disciples organized by [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | Mary Magdalene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. These revelations, often found in the Gnostic Gospels, presented truths that were suppressed by the Catholic Church in the 4th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. The church "preferred to delete" Mary Magdalene's personal relationship with Jesus and her role as a great exponent of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

The narrative of Jesus having children with Mary Magdalene and founding a lineage, as popularized by Dan Brown, is classified as brilliant fiction, not based on spiritual revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### The Council of Nicaea and the Holy Trinity

In 325 AD, Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, where Christian leaders transformed Christianity into Catholicism, creating the myth of the Holy Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. This was done to elevate Jesus to divine status, equal to God, and to disassociate him from his human side and the God of the Jews (Yahweh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. The concept of the Holy Spirit was also added, which Jesus himself never explicitly spoke of in the Gospels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. This theological invention is seen as illogical and indefensible by philosophers like Hegel, who struggled to justify the "consubstantiality" of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## The Nature of God and Evil: Mythology vs. Religion

[[historical_interpretations_of_biblical_events | Biblical exegesis]] and theology, often provide "justifications for the unjustifiable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. For example, the Christian teaching that God sacrificed his "only son as a lamb to pay for humanity's sins" is questioned as illogical, as no rational parent would do this to their child, nor would an omnipotent God need blood sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

### The Creation Myth: A Fallen Creator

Ancient mythologies, spanning 47,000 years of human rational thought, offer a different explanation for the origin of evil than modern religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. They consistently speak of a "cosmic egg" and a "fallen creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Chinese mythology:** Describes Pangu, the fallen creator, emerging from a cosmic egg with Yin and Yang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
*   **Hindu mythology:** Refers to Brahma Nanda, the egg of Brahma, from which a creator falls into one of the "holes," creating our "biological universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

These myths suggest that the creator "made a mistake" during the creation of reality, a literal "fall" that corrupted the original blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. This fallen creator rebuilt himself from "rotten parts" of himself, leading to a flawed creation where everything is "wrong or very badly" done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. Thus, according to mythologies, evil originates from this unintentional mistake of the creator, not from malicious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

Religions, emerging in the last 4,000 years, "canceled" these mythological explanations to create new myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. They took the figure of this fallen creator, such as Yahweh (God of the Jews), and portrayed him as a perfect, infallible being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The Bible's creation myth in Genesis, which states God saw his creation as "good" after each day, is seen as a copy of the Sumerian Akkadian myth, Enuma Elish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

### Original Sin and the Church's Role

The concept of original sin, attributed to Eve's disobedience, is presented as a "mental disorder" used by theology to justify practices like infant baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This doctrine, enforced by figures like Saint Augustine in the 4th century, forced belief in a perfect world created by a perfect God, despite the inherent struggles and "scavenger" nature of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Humans are deemed sinners, diseased, and expected to endure suffering as a "Divine favor" to fix the broken original code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

### The Devil: A Historical Invention

The figures of Lucifer, Satan, or the Devil are described as "all invention" by the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. While such beings exist, they are not in those terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. The church "needed to create an enemy" to explain evil and reinforce its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

A significant historical manipulation occurred with the [[the_influence_of_historical_rituals_and_symbols_in_modern_times | Knights Templar]]. In the 11th-13th centuries, the Templars sought to rescue the "historical Jesus" (not the "son of Yahweh") through ancient manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. They also functioned as a European bank, lending money without interest, which challenged the Vatican's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. The Pope and King Philip IV of France conspired to destroy the Templars, accusing them of worshipping Baphomet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. Baphomet, originally a symbol of wisdom (Chokhmah in Kabbalah), was demonized by the church, given horns, and became the figure of the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This "dirty detour" explains why Catholics began believing in the Devil from the 10th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

## Angels and Other Beings

The terms "angel" and "god" have been misused by humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. According to the speaker, angels are "robotic beings," clones that obey Yahweh, lacking individuality or free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. The concept of "demons" (Daiva in Sanskrit) arose when a spirit, previously a clone, awakened its consciousness and attacked Yahweh, leading to its spiritual transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>.

The Bible's mention of "giants" on Earth (Genesis 6:4) is interpreted as a mistranslation of "Nefel" or "Anunnaki," referring to "aliens" who came to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>. These beings, descendants of Anu, the sovereign of these aliens, mixed their genetics with humans, creating "demigods" or "Gigis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. The biblical flood, in this interpretation, was an attempt to eradicate these hybrid races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. Gilgamesh, from Mesopotamian mythology, is identified as one such demigod who sought a hidden launch base of the Anunnaki in what is now Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

## The Present Dystopia and Future Implications

The speaker argues that humanity lives in a "dystopian time" because humans have accumulated problems in all areas of life, passively waiting for "God to resolve everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>. This "childishly understood" religious faith is seen as the biggest obstacle to human progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:06">[01:59:06]</a>. The idea of a "personal God" who caters to human whims is deemed "ridiculous" and a "lack of respect for God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.

### External Influences on Humanity

Modern issues, such as the increasing global wealth disparity, environmental problems, and the rise of autonomous artificial intelligence, are seen as manifestations of humanity's failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:26">[02:18:26]</a>.

Furthermore, biological entities like **Toxoplasma gondii** and **Covid-19** are presented as examples of how humanity is being "imbecilized" or negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>. Toxoplasma gondii, for instance, alters rat behavior to facilitate its transmission to felines, its ultimate host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. The concern is that it is similarly affecting human behavior, leading to increased accidents and certain types of suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:35">[02:26:35]</a>.

Ancient texts like the Maha Bharata hint at "morphic fields" and a grand plan by beings from a "neighboring universe" to control biological life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. With the closing of portals between universes, humans inherited Earth, but now these beings may be attempting to reduce the human population, as their own universe is "ending before ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:27">[02:29:27]</a>.

### Megalithic Structures and Extraterrestrial Influence

Megalithic constructions worldwide, such as the Egyptian pyramids, the Sphinx, and Angkor Wat in Cambodia, are presented as evidence of an ancient, non-human influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. Research suggests that the alignment of the Giza pyramids precisely matches the stars of Orion's Belt, and the Sphinx's gaze aligns with the constellation Leo, both corresponding to the sky approximately 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:47">[02:42:47]</a>. Angkor Wat's temples align with the stars of the constellation Draco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:11">[02:45:11]</a>.

This phenomenon is linked to the "Legend of the Seven Sages Builders," survivors of a cataclysm that affected supercontinents like Hyperborea, who spread across the Earth to build structures containing messages for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:07">[02:46:07]</a>. The Dogon tribe in Africa possesses knowledge of the Sirius star system (Sirius A, B, and C) that aligns with these constructions, claiming their ancestors came from a planet orbiting Sirius C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

These revelations, combined with statements from figures like former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Hellyer acknowledging alien existence, suggest that humanity was "created by beings that have ever existed here on earth and these beings were not human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>.

The [[brazilian_political_landscape | Brazilian political landscape]] under [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Jair Bolsonaro's presidency]] has been a subject of intense debate and differing perspectives, particularly concerning its economic performance, social policies, and allegations of corruption and controversial alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Economic Performance

Discussions on Brazil's economy during [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro's tenure]] reveal contrasting viewpoints:
*   **Optimistic View:** Some argue that Brazil saw positive developments, such as breaking a record in trade balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It is asserted that the country's GDP retracted only 4.1% in 2020, despite forecasts of nearly a 10% drop, which was considered one of the best results among major world economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. The Brazilian trade balance reportedly increased by 69.7% in April 2021 compared to the previous month, achieving a positive balance of 10.35 billion, the largest since 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.

*   **Pessimistic View:** Critics point to a struggling economy, highlighting the rising price of gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Concerns were raised about Brazil having the most devalued currency in the world, the lowest GDP, and the second-highest inflation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. Investment in infrastructure is reported to be the lowest since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Social and Public Health Policies

[[social_issues_and_cultural_dynamics_in_brazil | Social issues]] and public health policies under [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] also draw mixed reactions:
*   **Vaccination and Pandemic Response:**
    *   Law 13,979, signed by [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Jair Bolsonaro]], mandates vaccination and grants powers to governors and mayors for compulsory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:19">[02:12:19]</a>. This law allows for compulsory medical examinations, tests, sample collection, vaccination, and other prophylactic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:05">[02:12:05]</a>.
    *   Critics argue that [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] initially resisted vaccine purchases and spread misinformation about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[02:11:53]</a>. He reportedly delayed buying vaccines, only engaging after the COVID CPI began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.
    *   Brazil was ranked 60th in the world for vaccinated inhabitants per 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>.
    *   The government's response to the pandemic, including advocating against "stay at home" campaigns, is criticized for contributing to economic destruction and job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
    *   The argument that governors and mayors held autonomy during the pandemic is a key defense for [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]]'s administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.
*   **Healthcare and Treatments:** The government's support for unproven treatments like chloroquine and ivermectin is a major point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.
*   **Other Social Issues:**
    *   On abortion, it's stated that abortion remains banned in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>, though some claim [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] previously supported it as a woman's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.
    *   Concerns were raised about increased clandestine abortions and sexualization of racial data during the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.
    *   The issue of armament is brought up, with criticism that [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] relied on ordinances and decrees instead of proper bills for pro-armament policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

## Political Alliances and Governance

[[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Bolsonaro's political strategy]] and alliances are heavily scrutinized:
*   **Centrão:** [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]]'s alliance with the Centrão (a bloc of centrist parties) is a major criticism, viewed by some as a betrayal of his anti-establishment campaign promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>. This alliance is seen as him "selling his soul" for governability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
*   **Relationship with Congress:** While critics point to the need for political articulation, supporters argue that [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] had to work with the composition of Congress and Senate elected by the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:44">[01:52:44]</a>.
*   **Political Reforms:**

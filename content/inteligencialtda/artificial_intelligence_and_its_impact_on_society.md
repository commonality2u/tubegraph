The rapid advancement of [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] (AI) is transforming society, raising questions about reality, employment, and human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Current [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | Applications of AI]]

Recent developments in AI include:
*   **Sora** Generates animations and 60-second videos from simple text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT** Provides conversational answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Midjourney** Creates images and paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Voice and Mouth Movement Technology** Can make a person speak in another language with their own voice and accurate mouth movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Biazinha** An [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | Artificial Intelligence]] that has been nurtured by consuming books and lectures to improve its responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Neuralink (Elon Musk)** Aims to integrate chips into the human brain, with initial promises to restore movement for individuals with spinal cord injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. While the prospect of enhancing intelligence or communication is considered, concerns exist regarding the ethical implications of programming personality traits or erasing memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

## [[Impact of Technology on Society | Societal Impact]] and Concerns

The rapid growth of [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | AI]] presents significant challenges and concerns for [[the_impact_of_technology_on_society | society]]:

### Blurring Reality
A primary concern is the increasing difficulty in discerning what is real from what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. People are increasingly living virtual lives and struggling to connect with real-life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This detachment from reality can lead to significant psychological distress, as seen in cases where individuals, accustomed to controlling their digital reality, struggle when faced with unfiltered real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:44">[02:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.

### [[Artificial Intelligences Impact on Employment and Society | Impact on Professions]]
AI's capabilities could lead to job displacement. While historical examples like bus fare collectors or gas station attendants show past occupational shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>, the pace of change now feels faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. For example, dubbers are already seeing changes in their field due to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

Regarding the future of psychology and psychiatry, it is believed that AI will not replace human therapists due to the necessity of human interaction and the inability of AI to provide genuine empathy or nuanced understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>. AI might assist with disease diagnosis, but human expertise remains critical for complex interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>.

### [[Ethics in Artificial Intelligence | Ethical Concerns]]
A significant concern lies in the parameters programmed into AI. If AI learns from social media, which contains much hate, it could perpetuate biased or harmful responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>. This raises questions about who is programming these intelligences and the moral guidelines they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>. The fear is not of AI itself, but of the human biases and limitations embedded within its programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:06">[02:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>.

### Psychological and Social Impact
The proliferation of virtual experiences and the "performance society" create a landscape where individuals constantly seek external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and a loss of personal identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The "fear of cancellation" on social media contributes significantly to mental health issues among young people, leading to increased rates of self-harm and suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:30">[02:36:30]</a>.

The rise of "AI girlfriends" also highlights a concerning trend of seeking [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | virtual relationships]] over real human connections. This can prevent individuals from investing in genuine relationships, as AI can be programmed to provide only desired responses, creating an echo chamber of validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Reality
Humans have historically adapted to new technologies and societal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. The current era, characterized as "liquid times" or "liquid relationships," demands continuous adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. Developing emotional intelligence, fostering authentic relationships, and focusing on personal well-being are critical for navigating the uncertainties posed by AI and modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>.

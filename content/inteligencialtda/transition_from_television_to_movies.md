After a highly successful career in Brazilian television, notably with programs like *Sai de Baixo* and *Mega Tom*, Tom Cavalcante made a significant transition to pursue a career in movies, primarily in Los Angeles, United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:43">[02:01:43]</a>. This move was driven by a desire for new experiences and a need to escape a demanding work routine that left him physically and mentally fatigued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:20">[02:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>.

## Departure from Brazilian Television
Cavalcante departed from Record, a major Brazilian television network, even though his show *Mega Tom* was still highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:54">[01:47:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a>. This decision was surprising to many and involved refusing an "irrefutable" offer of creative freedom and a significant salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:28">[01:46:28]</a>. He also hired a large team of nearly 30 people, including talents like Tiririca and Shaolin, for his daily show *Mega Tom* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:54">[01:47:54]</a>, which was an immense undertaking requiring a high level of daily production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>.

His decision to leave was an intuition, and he faced pressure from those who believed he would be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:23">[02:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:22">[02:04:22]</a>. He paid a substantial fine to terminate his seven-year contract one year early, an unusual move in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37">[01:54:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>.

## Relocating to Los Angeles and Film Studies
After leaving Record, Cavalcante moved to Los Angeles, a city he already knew well from frequent visits over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:56">[02:04:56]</a>. This period allowed him to relax and pursue formal studies in cinema and English in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:21">[02:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:29">[02:05:29]</a>.

## First Foray into Film Production
Cavalcante financed his first film project, collaborating with Brazilian director Gui Pereira, who lives in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. This experience was driven by a desire to gain technical knowledge of filmmaking, as he had often been invited to make films but lacked the necessary understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>.

The film was a feature-length production, a "medium film" without a commercial footprint, focusing on the history of 1960s gangsters in New York. Cavalcante's character, [[joao_canabrava | Jo√£o Canabrava]], was written into the plot as someone who dates the daughter of the state police chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:26">[02:07:26]</a>. The filming took 20 days and involved hiring crew members from American series, including a cameraman who worked on *Iron Man* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:15">[02:07:15]</a>.

[!INFO] **Hollywood Industry Insights**
Cavalcante observed the highly organized nature of Hollywood productions, noting their respect for schedules and union rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>. He also learned the importance of having an agent in Hollywood, as they are crucial for accessing directors and industry connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>. Despite meeting with a top comedy film agent who represented Jim Carrey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:39">[02:10:39]</a>, Cavalcante found that while Brazilians are admired, becoming a protagonist in Hollywood is still "more difficult" due to cultural and linguistic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:53">[02:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## Return to Brazil and Current Projects
After a period in the US, opportunities arose for his return to Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>. He received proposals from Multishow and other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. Currently, Tom Cavalcante is involved in:
*   A new series called *Novos Passos* (New Steps) which premiered on Globo Play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>.
*   *Dr. Darci*, a character with a radio show that will be broadcast on the web, where he portrays a female psychologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:33">[02:42:33]</a>.
*   *LOL* (Last One Laughing) on Amazon Prime, where he joined as a guest and later became a host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:50">[02:41:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:14">[02:43:14]</a>.

His experience in the US, especially learning to use the internet during the pandemic, profoundly influenced his approach to humor and engaging with audiences, including creating political satire videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:44">[02:34:44]</a>.

The world is currently experiencing a profound shift, moving towards a "dispute of control" rather than territorial expansion, focusing on influence over the mind, heart, and even DNA of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This new era, often termed the "era of control," is characterized by increasing monitoring and manipulation of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## The Evolution of Control

Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari suggests that the 20th century was dominated by communist/socialist and liberal/capitalist worldviews, which emphasized concepts like free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, Harari posits that the idea of free will is outdated, arguing that human beings are essentially the result of electrochemical processes, and thus, never truly possessed free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. He illustrates this by suggesting that actions, even violent ones, are not due to malice but rather "disorders" or "pathologies" within these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Technological Control and Free Will

The speaker recounts personal experiences with medication affecting behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> and notes how modern remedies for disorders like depression and bipolarity interfere with decisions and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This leads to the idea that if technology could introduce devices to control impulses or undesirable decisions, it might be seen as beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

This concept extends to:
*   **Social Networks and Streaming Services:** These platforms already exert control by curating content, leading to "bubbles" where individuals primarily encounter reinforcing views, limiting exposure to differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The algorithm learns preferences and suggests content, reducing individual research and choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Loss of Freedom:** The speaker observes a gradual loss of free will, as everything becomes increasingly virtual, and individuals are continuously tracked through their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Money, for instance, is now entirely virtual and traceable, contrasting with past times when physical assets offered a degree of financial autonomy during persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## [[Advancements in technology and potential impacts | Technological Advancements]] and Control

The push for greater control is exemplified by the concept of "superhumans" â€“ human beings improved through the introduction of chips and electronic devices, capable of competing with [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. While these advancements might offer benefits, such as treating depression with electromagnetic sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, the danger lies in who controls these devices once they are integrated into human life and connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

The ability for computers to identify brain waves and decode thoughts into writing already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:12">[02:36:12]</a>. Future [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications | AI analysis]] could lead to complete understanding of human thoughts, potentially affecting choices and decisions, and even beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### The Fourth Revolution and its [[impacts_of_social_media_and_artificial_intelligence_on_society | Societal Impact]]

Society is currently undergoing the "fourth revolution," distinct from previous agricultural, industrial, and computer revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. This new revolution is driven by biotechnology and [[artificial_intelligence_and_robotics | Artificial Intelligence]], which will interfere with human lives and biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

*   **Epigenetics:** The concept of epigenetics suggests that thoughts can influence genes, and deep emotions or disorders like depression can physically alter one's genetic makeup, potentially passing predispositions to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.
*   **The Elixir of Eternal Life:** Scientists are researching telomerase to prevent cell aging, hinting at the possibility of eternal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.
*   **Neurological Control:** Understanding how the brain's chemistry works (e.g., dopamine production and addiction) leads to the scientific desire to interfere with these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## [[Technological control and its impact on society | Concerns and Misconceptions about AI]]

The internet was once imagined as a tool for greater freedom, but it appears to be leading to increased control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This is partly due to [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | Artificial Intelligence]], which is already categorized into types:
*   **Type 1 AI:** Specific AI like vehicle lane-keeping assist or robot vacuum cleaners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.
*   **Type 2 AI:** Computers that learn and make decisions, exemplified by supercomputers playing chess or Go, which learn from opponents' moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.
*   **Advanced AI:** This is the AI depicted in films like *Terminator* or *The Matrix*, where machines possess their own intelligence and decision-making capabilities, leading to complex scenarios where reality itself might be a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

The speaker expresses concern about the increasing control over human lives through devices and data, linking it to the biblical concept of the "mark of the beast," which would eventually require conscious worship of an entity in exchange for participation in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. The argument is that while some technological advancements may be voluntary (e.g., chip implants in Sweden and Italy), the future might see compulsory implementation for "dangerous" individuals, affecting temperament and autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

Films like *Gattaca* are cited as cautionary tales, critiquing eugenics and a society where genetic perfection determines opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. The pursuit of immortality through cloning and mind transference is also portrayed in cinema, hinting at future possibilities where individuals could effectively "buy" eternal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

Ultimately, the speaker warns that the world is advancing rapidly towards a future where humanity might not fully understand the implications, with a "super positivist" view that technology will solve all problems, contrasting with the often dystopian portrayals in fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

> "Today you are watching a movie, the television is reading you... you are connected to a streaming service, right? on the internet... facial recognition is in another level... Bars in establishments already know where you're reading it so I'll stay very worried because everything is happening at once and It's happening all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>

This rapid advancement suggests a future of profound [[impact_of_technology_and_digital_media_on_intelligence | technological control]] and manipulation.

Rogério Vilela and Diguinho shared various experiences related to their public lives, from the daily interactions with fans to the broader impact of their media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Public Recognition and Encounters

Being in the public eye often leads to unexpected encounters. Diguinho recounts an incident where an engineer from Band FM, mistaking his twin brother for him, slapped his brother on the neck in a shopping mall as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This led to Diguinho realizing the need for a sign warning people he has a twin brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

On a different occasion, Diguinho's public visibility had a direct impact on his stand-up career. After a controversial on-air incident with Danilo Gentili that garnered significant media attention, Diguinho's solo show sold out, with about 800 people attending, making him "the fat man in the bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. His mother expressed concern, scolding him for irritating Sônia Abrão and potentially damaging his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Diguinho notes that since his podcast, he expects to be stopped more often in public due to increased prominence, particularly in places like bakeries or toy stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. He distinguishes between himself and his co-star, Juliana, noting her patience with fans, while he prefers to interact when he feels "fine" to avoid being perceived as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. He shared an anecdote of a motorcyclist shouting "fat Danilo" at him while he was with his daughter at the dentist, causing his daughter to ask if it was meant for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Fan Interactions and Support

The public's involvement extends to the show itself, with viewers able to participate through "Super Chat" for questions or comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Diguinho has received considerable support from his audience. He recalls how Sônia Abrão's mentions on her radio show significantly boosted his career early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Listeners of his radio program have sent him gifts, including expensive watches from a Portuguese gardener living in Switzerland, and R$10,000 from a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:36">[02:37:36]</a>. He also received numerous cakes and pies from listeners when he hinted about wanting them on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.

However, public interaction can also be challenging. Diguinho recounts being surrounded by about 30 people at a train station while with his young daughter, highlighting the difficulty of maintaining a normal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>. He sometimes finds it annoying when people film him in public without consent, especially in mundane situations like buying meat at a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>. Evangelical fans once rushed to hug him at a market during the pandemic, prompting him to ask them not to touch him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Life

The constant public exposure has affected Diguinho's family. His mother once believed a prank call from a colleague, telling her Diguinho was dating a transvestite, leading to a tearful conversation at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:39">[02:19:39]</a>. He notes that the public often has no filter, believing they can insult TV personalities. He anticipates his daughter might also face teasing at school due to his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:34">[01:48:34]</a>.

Despite the [[Challenges of working in the entertainment industry|challenges]], Diguinho recognizes the importance of interacting with his audience. He emphasizes that the "radio is a big lie that brings great truths," using techniques to engage listeners and encourage them to share their real stories, which in turn enriches his program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. He expresses pride in being able to help his two young employees earn better salaries than many radio announcers in São Paulo, thanks to his independent internet radio venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>.

### Medical and Personal Details Shared

Diguinho openly discusses his personal health struggles, including a severe lung condition in his youth that led to fainting and ICU visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:06]</a>. He shares a profound near-death experience where he felt like he left his body and observed doctors attempting a tracheostomy, only to be saved by a Japanese woman who intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:28">[02:45:28]</a>. He had previously spoken about this experience on "The Night" show, though he later regretted sharing it due to colleagues' reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:36">[02:43:36]</a>. He also openly discusses his diabetes, mentioning that fans even send him medicine tips during live chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>.

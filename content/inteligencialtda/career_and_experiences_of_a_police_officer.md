## Introduction
Mauro Dias is a retired police officer who practiced his profession for 33 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. His dream throughout his life has been to work in law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>. He served in police intelligence at both the beginning and end of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>. A significant portion of his career was spent in the homicide department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>. Currently, he is a non-tenured professor at the Police Academy, specializing in police investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52">[01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.

Mauro Dias describes the delegate's career as a hybrid one, combining legal and multidisciplinary police work. This involves operating within the law, handling judicial representations, precautionary measures, and arrest warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54">[18:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00">[19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08">[19:08]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of teamwork, acknowledging a "wonderful team" that greatly assisted him throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19">[31:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25">[31:25]</a>.

## Notable Cases and Investigative Approach
Throughout his career, Mauro Dias presided over thousands of arrests and investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>. Some cases garnered significant media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>. He highlights that he treated all cases equally, regardless of their public profile, stating, "I'm boring, I do the same thing to everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:0:40">[02:0:40]</a>. His primary goal was to resolve cases quickly to move them through the justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:47">[02:1:47]</a>.

### Oscar Freire Case
One of the cases he handled was the Oscar Freire case, where two individuals – a model and the brother of Prodesp's president, Murilo Rezende Bozzola – were murdered inside an apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. The perpetrator, a friend of the victims named Lucas, was sentenced to 60 years for double robbery (latrocínio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54">[05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>. Mauro Dias notes that latrocínio cases are tried in a common court, not a jury court, because they are considered crimes against property, even though they involve death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44">[06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>. He believes criminals have a better chance of receiving a more severe sentence in a jury court due to the emotional impact of visual evidence on jurors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38">[07:38]</a>.

### Pedra da Macumba Case
In this case, a woman was found deceased on the Santa Inês Road, near a site known as "Pedra da Macumba" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:17">[02:1:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:19">[02:1:19]</a>. Initially, the coroner's report suggested homicide, with evidence of throat cutting and lead poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:26">[02:1:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:31">[02:1:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:04">[02:54:04]</a>. However, through his investigation, Mauro Dias proved it was a suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:34">[02:1:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:39">[02:1:39]</a>.

His process involved:
*   **Contradicting initial reports**: He noted that if the woman's throat had been cut while alive, there would be blood everywhere, but the blood was only on her back, indicating she was already dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:31">[02:54:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>.
*   **Investigating animal activity**: Noticing the body's disfigurement, he suspected scavenging animals. To confirm, he conducted an experiment by leaving a piece of pig meat at the scene, which was quickly consumed by wild animals, including rats and opossums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:44">[02:58:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:50">[03:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:52">[03:00:52]</a>.
*   **Consulting experts**: He sought advice from an entomologist, a professor at the Police Academy, who confirmed that the injuries on the victim's face and the specific paw print on her shirt were consistent with animal activity (opossum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:07">[03:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:09">[03:02:09]</a>.
*   **Analyzing personal history**: He uncovered that the victim suffered from precocious depression and had a history of five suicide attempts, the first at age 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:15">[03:07:15]</a>. Her family had hidden this information from the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:22">[03:07:22]</a>.
*   **Digital forensics**: A search warrant for her home revealed computer searches on "how long does it take to die with lead" and the effects of lead poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:29">[03:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:46">[03:08:46]</a>. This confirmed she intentionally ingested lead, known as "chumbinho," a common poison used to kill rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:35">[03:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:57">[03:08:57]</a>.

Ultimately, Mauro Dias proved the case was suicide, contradicting the initial homicide report, a testament to the multidisciplinary nature of a delegate's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:36">[02:1:36]</a>.

### Elisa Matsunaga Case (Yoki Director's Murder)
This high-profile case involved the murder and dismemberment of Marcos Matsunaga, a director at Yoki, by his wife, Elisa Matsunaga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:20">[02:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:22">[02:14:22]</a>. Mauro Dias was assigned to the case after initial investigations in Cotia, where the dismembered body was found, were transferred to DHPP (Homicide Department) due to its repercussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>.

His investigation timeline and methods included:
*   **Initial assessment**: Upon receiving the case, Mauro Dias immediately recognized the precise nature of the body's dismemberment, deducing it was done by someone with anatomical knowledge, possibly a veterinarian, necropsy assistant, or butcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:52">[02:29:52]</a>. He suspected a "hate crime" due to the excessive violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>.
*   **Identifying the victim**: Within a week, the victim was identified as Marcos Matsunaga through a missing person's report and his brother's recognition at the IML (Medical Legal Institute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:0:55">[02:0:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:0:57">[02:0:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:06">[02:7:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:13">[02:7:13]</a>.
*   **Gathering witness testimonies**:
    *   **Marcos's brother**: Provided crucial details about Marcos's married life, revealing his wife, Elisa, had a law degree, was a neurologist, and an instrument nurse, a detail that immediately raised suspicion due to her surgical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:15">[02:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:13">[02:52:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:49">[02:59:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:0:07">[03:0:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:0:29">[03:0:29]</a>.
    *   **The Reverend**: The couple's spiritual mentor and psychologist, who shockingly told Mauro Dias, "I told Marcos that she was going to kill him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:41">[03:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:51">[03:06:51]</a>. He also revealed Elisa’s deteriorating mental state and that Marcos had numerous weapons in their apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:12">[03:08:12]</a>.
*   **Collecting physical evidence**:
    *   **Surveillance footage**: An investigator secured 10 days of surveillance footage from the couple's building. The footage showed Marcos returning with a pizza, and later, Elisa leaving with three large suitcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:24">[03:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47">[03:47:47]</a>. The suitcases were later identified as containing the dismembered body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:43">[03:57:43]</a>.
    *   **Search and Seizure**: Based on the evidence, Mauro Dias obtained warrants for search, seizure, and temporary arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Confronting Elisa**: Mauro Dias orchestrated a calculated confrontation with Elisa. He used a female colleague to lure Elisa down from her apartment by posing as a social worker from the city hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. When Elisa appeared, he directly asked her, "Why did you kill your husband?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Her static reaction and lowered head indicated guilt, a "sign language" he interpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence in the apartment**: During the search, he found and seized the clothes Elisa was wearing in the surveillance footage, which had been washed, and identified boots with clay on them, linking her to the disposal site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:8:00">[05:8:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. He also found blue trash bags with a red ribbon, identical to those used to wrap the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Weapon discovery**: Numerous weapons, including a 12-gauge shotgun, were found hidden throughout the apartment, confirming the Reverend's testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Cell phone data**: A court order allowed access to Elisa's and Marcos's phone records. By mapping Elisa's calls to cell tower locations (azimuth), Mauro Dias placed her at the exact location and time where the body was spawned in Cotia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Confession and Reconstruction**: Presented with irrefutable evidence, Elisa confessed to the crime, stating she killed Marcos with a shot to the head before dismembering him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>. She explained she didn't remove his shirt because it was harder than removing pants, and she even attempted to dispose of the bullet casing in the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. Her confession led to a comprehensive crime scene reconstruction, where she detailed every step of the murder and dismemberment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>. Mauro Dias stated that the confession of the accused is a mandatory cause for sentence reduction in Brazilian criminal legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

## Reflections on Justice and Law Enforcement
Mauro Dias reflects on the complexities of the Brazilian justice system, particularly regarding jury trials and public perception. He notes that the public often only sees the results of an investigation, not the intense, often around-the-clock, work put in by law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of swift action in investigations, as "time is the greatest enemy of evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

He believes in the [[overcoming_career_difficulties_and_finding_success|resocialization]] of "criminals of passion" who commit crimes due to complex relationship journeys, as opposed to professional criminals like robbers or drug dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:38">[03:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:13">[03:14:13]</a>. He criticizes the lenient nature of Brazilian penal benefits, citing instances where criminals are released quickly despite severe offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:17">[01:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:20">[01:53:20]</a>. He shares an anecdote of a Bolivian thief who preferred to steal in Brazil because of the quick release laws compared to his home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>.

Mauro Dias's [[experiences_with_crime_and_law_enforcement|experiences with crime and law enforcement]] also highlight the psychological impact of investigations on professionals, particularly when dealing with horrific crimes and individuals who lack remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:26">[01:40:26]</a>. He acknowledges the natural human response to trauma but stresses the need for objective and rapid decision-making in his profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.

International cooperation in space has historically been a cornerstone of space exploration, fostering significant advancements and shared scientific goals. However, geopolitical tensions, notably the ongoing war in Ukraine, have severely impacted these collaborations, leading to conflicts and re-evaluations of partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Impact of the War in Ukraine on Space Collaboration

The war in Ukraine has introduced significant consequences for [[space_exploration_and_geopolitics | space exploration]] due to Russia's involvement as a major space-faring nation with global projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Russia collaborates with the United States, Europe, China, and Japan in various space endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Roscosmos and Dmitry Rogozin
Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, is headed by Dmitry Rogozin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Rogozin, a politician with a background in Putin's administration, has adopted an aggressive stance during the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Threats and Actions**: Rogozin threatened the stability of the [[current_and_future_space_missions | International Space Station (ISS)]], suggesting Russia might withdraw its parts and cause it to crash in the United States or other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. He also announced Russia would no longer sell rocket engines used by American rockets or provide support for existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal from French Guiana**: Rogozin ordered all Russian personnel to return from the Kourou launch base in French Guiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **OneWeb Satellite Launch**: He refused to launch OneWeb satellites, even though the contract was paid, demanding the UK (a shareholder) withdraw from the company's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **ExoMars Mission**: The ExoMars mission, a joint European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos project involving a European-built rover (Rosalind Franklin) and Russian launch/landing platforms, has been halted due to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The rover's future is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Broader Consequences
These actions are a direct response to Western sanctions against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Russia is increasingly isolating itself in the space sector, which may prevent future collaborations with agencies like the ESA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. China's position remains somewhat dubious, though recent news suggests a strengthening of the China-Russia relationship in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Key Space Powers and their International Roles

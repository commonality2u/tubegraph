The Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) is a highly organized criminal faction with a structured hierarchy and extensive operations both within Brazil and abroad. A former member, Frank, provides insights into its internal workings, recruitment, financial schemes, and influence on various sectors of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Membership and Exit from the PCC

Joining the PCC, referred to as "baptism," involves specific rituals and commitments. Leaving the faction, however, is extremely difficult and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Becoming a Member
To be baptized into the PCC in São Paulo, two godfathers are required: one "reference" godfather who has known the initiate for at least four years, and another godfather who may have just met the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:03">[02:27:03]</a>. The initiate must also accept the faction's statute, which includes 17 main items and 43 sub-items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>.

The PCC seeks individuals with "intelligence" and "vision" who can "exchange ideas" and "do the right thing" within their framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>. They portray themselves as "revolutionaries" fighting "against the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:47">[02:27:47]</a>. However, their true goal is to establish an "even worse" new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>.

New members must state their objective, which is typically to "serve the party" and "make a difference," not to "grow" within the faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:42">[02:34:42]</a>. They are assigned a nickname, and their full name, past arrests, and any time spent in juvenile detention centers (like Febem) are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:44">[02:31:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:41">[02:32:41]</a>. Only individuals with a criminal past are typically recruited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>.

### Difficulty of Leaving the PCC
Leaving the PCC is considered "impossible" in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While "exclusion" is a way to leave alive, it depends on the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Once a member, one is "obliged to keep the commitment" and "accept everything they tell you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Frank himself requested to leave to work and spend time with his children, but a misstep led to his "exclusion" and being "decreed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Being "decreed" means any criminal in the State of São Paulo can take that person's life without a "crime court" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This forces ex-members like Frank to constantly change addresses and travel between cities and even countries, often receiving threats and videos of torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## PCC Hierarchical Structure

The PCC operates with a complex hierarchical structure akin to a political party or a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

*   **Final Tuning**: The highest level, led by figures like Marcola, Julinho Carambola, Barbará, Jackal, and others. They determine alliances with other factions, political parties, and overall strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. They operate internally (prison) and externally (street) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Street Tuning**: Responsible for street operations, following orders from the final tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Summary**: Brothers who relay decisions from the tuning to lower levels. Not just anyone can contact the "tuning" directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Support of the Summary**: Aids the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[02:29:27]</a>.
*   **General of Inter**: Divided by regional DDD codes (e.g., 011 for São Paulo, 013 for Baixada Santista), responsible for the general affairs of that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.
*   **General City**: Each city has its own general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.
*   **Discipline**: The lowest position, responsible for a specific neighborhood or "hood." They enforce rules and handle disputes within their assigned area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:10">[02:16:10]</a>. Frank himself was a "PCC from the hood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **FM (Family Store)**: Lowest position, responsible for "mouths of smoke" (drug dens) belonging to the command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:46">[02:07:46]</a>.

## PCC Rules and "Justice"

The PCC has strict rules and a system of "justice" that aims to control communities and maintain its perceived order.

### Internal Rules and Punishments
The PCC emphasizes that "crime strengthens crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Members must prioritize the PCC above God and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>. For example, a member must "charge" their own mother, daughter, or son if they commit a "mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:54">[02:48:54]</a>.

Prohibited acts include:
*   **Talaricagem**: Taking another member's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:04">[02:50:04]</a>.
*   **Rati**: Stealing things within the community or drugs from another member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.
*   **Snitching**: Reporting on criminal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:12">[02:50:12]</a>. Frank was "decreed" for reporting on the PCC's financial maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:19">[02:48:19]</a>.
*   **Opportunism**: Waiting for a better time to raise a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.
*   Running from the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:19">[02:52:19]</a>.

Punishments for rule-breaking include:
*   **Being "removed"**: A 90-day "rest" period from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Beating**: For theft or other infractions, usually from the neck down. The goal is to inflict real pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:48">[02:02:48]</a>.
*   **Life Threat/Execution**: If a member tries to react during a beating or if a severe rule is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>. The form of death can be chosen: knife, hanging, or "Gatorade" (instant overdose with cocaine dissolved in water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:58">[02:06:58]</a>.
*   **Physical Mutilation**: Breaking arms, legs, or hands. For severe offenses like infidelity, all joints might be broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:08">[02:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:44">[02:12:44]</a>.
*   **For Rival Factions**: Torture, cutting fingers, hands, ears, nose, and forcing victims to eat their own body parts, to intimidate other factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. Executions can involve pickaxes to the head or forced digging of one's own grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

### Community Control and "Crime Courts"
The PCC effectively controls favelas and communities in São Paulo, acting as a parallel state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. They prevent unauthorized crime within their territories; for instance, one cannot steal a motorcycle without PCC authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:49">[02:09:49]</a>. This is part of their effort to present a "false image" of being "in favor of the community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:13">[02:15:13]</a>.

The "board" or "crime court" serves as their judicial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:50">[02:17:50]</a>. It involves an accused, an accuser, "disciplines" (judges), and "prosecutors" who investigate. The "tune" (high-ranking member) gives the final approval on punishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. If a judgment is deemed irregular, the responsible members can face severe consequences, including death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:02">[03:38:02]</a>.

The PCC dictates many aspects of daily life, such as whether a dance can happen in a street, regardless of religious events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>. They also handle domestic disputes, with the "discipline" resolving conflicts between husband and wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>.

The PCC's famous motto is "Peace, Justice, and Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:36">[02:46:36]</a>. However, this is described as a "lie" as they are constantly at war, commit injustices, and impose their will, restricting true freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:47">[02:46:47]</a>.

## PCC Business Operations

The PCC controls a vast criminal economy.

### Drug Trafficking
The PCC controls drug trafficking networks, with cocaine primarily coming from Baixada Santista (due to the port) and some from Bolivia or Colombia, used for mixing with stronger Peruvian powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>. Marijuana mostly originates from Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:01">[02:43:01]</a>. Crack is manufactured in Brazil, including in Heliópolis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:07">[02:43:07]</a>.

The PCC does not prohibit the sale of crack to the community, but strictly forbids its members from using it. A member caught smoking crack is excluded or even executed, as users are seen as unreliable "noias" (junkies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>. This hypocrisy serves to maintain the PCC's image as "conductors of life" while profiting from addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.

"Mouths of smoke" (bocas de fumo) are drug dens. Anyone can buy and operate a drug den in São Paulo, with prices for a "street" point ranging from R$ 250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:16">[02:41:16]</a>. These operations are meticulously registered, including the date of sale and value, like a legitimate business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:40">[02:44:40]</a>.

[[Cracolândia | Cracolândia]] is considered the PCC's largest "FM smoke den," managed by a sector with a manager, assistant manager, and PCC members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:32">[02:11:32]</a>. The PCC could end crack use if it chose to, but it prioritizes profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>.

### Financial Structure and Money Laundering
Members pay a monthly fee (e.g., R$930) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. The "Progress" sector requires members to purchase 1kg of cocaine (worth R$12,000) from the PCC, essentially a mandatory purchase scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:41">[02:47:41]</a>. The PCC also runs raffles (RF sector) offering prizes like rifles, guns, drugs (1kg of powder, 10kg of marijuana), cars, houses, or drug dens, generating income since 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:03">[02:46:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:59">[02:55:59]</a>.

Money laundering occurs through:
*   **Influencers**: The PCC sponsors artists and influencers who promote games and engage in propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:58">[01:54:58]</a>.
*   **Online Games**: Games like "Tiger" are linked to money laundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>.
*   **Various Businesses**: Including bus companies, health services, cleaning companies, and organized football fan groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>.

Large drug transactions are handled with cash, often millions of Brazilian Reals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:28">[02:06:28]</a>. Pix transfers are used for smaller amounts (up to R$100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>. The export of cocaine to Europe involves Euros, with a kilogram fetching €12,000-€20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:31">[03:36:31]</a>.

## PCC's Influence and Infiltration

The PCC has a significant presence across various societal layers, often manipulating public perception and infiltrating legitimate institutions.

### Relationship with Police and State
The PCC exploits the absence of the state in communities, providing "social support" like basic food baskets, Mother's Day parties, and medicine donations, creating a false image of being beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:51">[02:49:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>. This strategy turns the population against the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

Police face limitations in entering communities due to lack of resources, judicial orders, and the risk of being ambushed by heavily armed criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:52">[02:40:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:52">[02:43:52]</a>. The PCC intimidates residents who cooperate with the police, threatening them if they report crimes or help law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:09">[02:54:09]</a>.

### Political and Institutional Infiltration
The PCC seeks to infiltrate politics, operating like a political party with a hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:34">[02:45:34]</a>. They actively direct members and their families to vote for specific candidates, as seen with their request to vote for Lula in the presidential election, opposing Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>.

Infiltration extends to:
*   **Public Transport**: Bus companies in São Paulo are linked to the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>. Drivers have been forced to sell their buses to gang members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:33">[02:28:33]</a>.
*   **Healthcare and Cleaning**: Involvement in health schemes in hospitals and cleaning companies in Baixada Santista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>.
*   **Organized Fan Groups**: The PCC influences organized football fan groups, even dictating whether fights can occur in stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
*   **Judicial System**: The "tie sector" (setor das gravatas) within the PCC is responsible for hiring and paying lawyers to defend members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:23">[02:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>. Lawyers often know which forums to approach and how to secure releases for criminals, sometimes through low bail amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:58">[03:00:58]</a>. Cases exist where civil police have allegedly kidnapped individuals for ransom, with the "party" (PCC) paying for their release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:32">[02:12:32]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: The PCC has a "real estate sector" responsible for buying and selling faction properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a>. They exploit government housing programs like "My House My Life," buying up apartments at low prices from residents who flee dangerous neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. They also control "occupations" (invasions) of abandoned buildings in downtown São Paulo, turning them into drug dens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:58">[02:07:58]</a>.

### Media Portrayal
Frank criticizes media portrayals, particularly series like "Sintonia," for romanticizing crime and misrepresenting the PCC. These series allegedly make criminals appear as "victims of society" and show them engaging in activities (like directly asking to join the PCC or talking to police) that are forbidden in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:11">[02:14:11]</a>. They also portray police as corrupt and cowardly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>.

## PCC vs. Comando Vermelho (CV)

The PCC and [[Comando Vermelho (CV) | Comando Vermelho]] (CV) were former allies but became rivals after the death of "Rafat" at the border. Both factions accused each other of attempting a "coup," leading to their conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The PCC allied with the TCP (Terceiro Comando Puro) in Rio de Janeiro against the CV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>.

Key differences between the two factions:
*   **Ideology**: PCC focuses on structure, alliances, and leveraging its "name" and control over territories. CV prioritizes direct warfare, heavily arming its members, and investing financially in its "soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:03">[02:54:03]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: While São Paulo is peaceful due to PCC dominance, other states (Northeast, Central-West, South) experience constant warfare between the two factions, with many minors involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:50">[02:16:50]</a>.
*   **Recruitment of Minors**: PCC baptizes from age 16 in northeastern states, a recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. CV is "even more bizarre," baptizing from ages 11-12 if they can "squeeze a trigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>.
*   **Punishment**: CV is considered "more cruel" than PCC because it punishes entire families for a member's mistake or escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:43">[02:19:43]</a>. PCC, in contrast, targets only the offending member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>.
*   **Strength**: PCC has a larger number of members. However, CV has more strength in "war armament" and "tactical structure of warrior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:56">[02:25:56]</a>. CV is gaining more territory from PCC in states like Espírito Santo, Bahia, and Paraíba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:47">[02:17:47]</a>.

## Frank's Personal Story and Perspective

Frank joined crime at 15, driven by a "lack of shame" and a desire for "the easy way out," despite having hardworking parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:47">[02:35:47]</a>. He experienced poverty and saw drug dealers profiting easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:14">[02:36:14]</a>.

He spent a year in FEBEM (juvenile detention center) after committing robberies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:47">[02:36:47]</a>. Surprisingly, he "thanks God" for his time there, as it was where he first encountered the Bible and learned about Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:01">[02:37:01]</a>. He describes FEBEM as a place where inmates were well-fed, slept long hours, and had a healthy routine, refuting claims of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>. However, he notes that his time in FEBEM did not deter him from returning to crime upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:57">[02:40:57]</a>. He believes the system should invest in rehabilitation and work, not just sustenance, arguing that "humanization" should focus on communities, not prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>.

After being decreed by the PCC, Frank recorded a video warning youth about crime, believing it would be his last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:32">[02:38:32]</a>. The video gained widespread support, leading him to continue reporting on criminals to "redeem his soul" and warn others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:37">[02:39:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:30">[02:40:30]</a>. He is constantly on the run, using IP camouflage and VPNs, and struggles financially due to blocked accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>.

Frank maintains that Brazil is "in the hands of Organized Crime" and that the fight now is to "bring it back into the hands of the Worker, of the good citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:55">[02:29:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. He advocates for "leather and work" (hard labor and forced labor) for prisoners, arguing that crime should be "ridiculed" and seen as shameful, not romanticized by media or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:22">[03:08:22]</a>. He believes that a criminal should not have the right to hold public office or take the place of honest workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>.

He lives as a "dead man" in the eyes of the PCC, but continues to speak out because he believes it's God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. Despite the risks and lack of support from politicians or institutions, he sees himself as a vital source of truth, as criminals feel more comfortable reporting to him due to his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:51">[03:31:51]</a>.

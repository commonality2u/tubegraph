Discussions on the state of Brazil, its [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | government policies]], and [[economic_policies_and_privatization_in_brazil | economic impacts]] frequently compare the current [[economic_and_social_policies_during_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro administration]] with previous PT (Workers' Party) governments, often highlighting perceived successes and failures.

## Brazil's Current State

From a conservative viewpoint, skepticism is inherent, requiring action without expecting guaranteed positive outcomes. Optimism is necessary for Brazil's future, especially in recovering from the economic and moral decline observed in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

### Economic Challenges and Responses
The nation faces significant [[public_policies_and_socioeconomic_issues_in_brazil | economic challenges]], including:
*   **Job Losses:** Over 100,000 jobs were reportedly destroyed in Belo Horizonte due to "stay at home" campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fuel Prices:** High gasoline prices are a daily concern for Brazilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Recession:** Brazil is experiencing economic recession, with its currency being one of the most devalued globally and GDP falling significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[48:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation:** Brazil's inflation rate is among the highest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, proponents of the current government point to positive economic indicators:
*   **Trade Balance:** Brazil's trade balance increased by 69.7% in April 2021, marking the largest positive balance since 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:23:00">[58:23:00]</a>.
*   **Auctions and Investments:** In April 2021, the government conducted 31 auctions, resulting in R$54 billion in listed investments and R$26.5 billion in authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:06:00">[59:06:00]</a>.
*   **Job Creation:** 60,000 jobs were created in March 2021, even during the second wave of COVID-19, with over 1.5 million jobs created by June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:14:00">[59:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.
*   **GDP Performance:** While forecasts predicted a nearly 10% drop, Brazil's GDP retracted only 4.1% in 2020, achieving one of the best results among major world economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:23:00">[59:23:00]</a>.
*   **[[economic_policies_and_privatization_in_brazil | Privatization]]:** The government initiated the [[economic_policies_and_privatization_in_brazil | privatization]] of the Post Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a> and Petrobras sold 90% of its associated transport actions of Gaspetro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Measures:** A decree was issued to cut 21,000 positions and functions in the Federal executive, saving an estimated R$195 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:42:00">[59:42:00]</a>.
*   **Emergency Aid:** 64 million Brazilians benefited from emergency aid, and an employment protection program preserved over 12 million jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:00">[59:34:00]</a>.

### Social and Cultural Impacts
Concerns were raised regarding [[social_issues_and_cultural_dynamics_in_brazil | Brazil's moral sphere]], with a perceived decline in values among youth, leading to a generation "without good references" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This is seen as a negative legacy of previous left-wing governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

## [[economic_and_social_policies_during_bolsonaros_presidency | Government Policies]] and Controversies

### COVID-19 Response
The [[economic_and_social_policies_during_bolsonaros_presidency | Bolsonaro government's]] handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is a major point of contention:
*   **Vaccine Procurement:** The government was criticized for not purchasing vaccines when offered, particularly the Covax vaccine, which was not yet approved by ANVISA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This commitment was only broken after the CPI of COVID began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Vaccination:** Law 13,979, signed by Jair Bolsonaro, makes vaccination mandatory and grants governors and mayors powers for compulsory vaccination, and it states that measures for public health emergencies "may be adopted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **"Stay at Home" Policy:** The government opposed "stay at home" measures, with the president stating that unemployment and hunger could cause more deaths than the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. However, states and municipalities had autonomy in enforcing lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Health Changes:** The removal of Nelson Teich from the Ministry of Health was attributed to his disagreement with the use of chloroquine, a drug favored by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Political Actions]] and [[government_corruption_and_public_administration_in_brazil | Governance]]
The government's [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | political landscape]] and [[government_corruption_and_public_administration_in_brazil | governance]] drew criticism:
*   **Secret Budget:** Accusations of a "secret budget" of R$43 billion were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. However, it was argued that this information is published in the Official Gazette, making it not truly "secret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   **[[government_corruption_and_public_administration_in_brazil | Corruption]]:** Despite claims of not committing corruption, instances like a deputy leader of the government found with money in his underwear were cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Interference in Federal Police (PF):** The dismissal of PF delegates investigating cases related to government allies and the president's family was presented as evidence of interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **[[brazilian_political_landscape | Alliances]] with "Centrão":** Bolsonaro's public statement about being part of the "centrão" (center-right political bloc) was criticized as a betrayal of his campaign promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>. This shift is seen as necessary for [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | governability]] due to the composition of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>.
*   **Legislative Reforms:**
    *   **Tax Reform:** The government's tax reform was deemed "pitiful" and accused of increasing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
    *   **Administrative Reform:** The proposed administrative reform is considered "lousy" for not including military personnel or judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Spending Ceiling:** Bolsonaro is accused of wanting to "blow up the roof of spending" to increase public servant salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Judges of Guarantees:** The sanctioning of the "judge of guarantees" amendment, which opponents claimed facilitates corruption, was a point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.
    *   **Plea Bargain Limitation:** The limitation of plea bargains, included in an anti-crime package, was deemed "not beneficial for the big investigations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>.
    *   **COAF (UIF) to Central Bank:** The change of COAF's (now UIF) subordination from the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank was presented as a move to remove political pressure and give the Central Bank more independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>.

## Future Outlook

There is a debate about whether Brazil will see an alternative to the current [[brazils_political_landscape_and_electoral_politics | political landscape]] dominated by Bolsonaro and Lula, or if the country will face continued "destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The growth of a "third way" candidate, like Sérgio Moro, is considered by some to be non-existent without significant popular support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>.

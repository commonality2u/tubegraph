The discussion explores the profound [[Technological advancements and societal impact | impact of technology and digital media]] on human behavior and society, particularly focusing on [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social media]] and [[Impact of artificial intelligence on society | Artificial Intelligence]].

## Fiction Anticipating Reality
Many fictions have become reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Artists are considered visionary, capable of seeing "Plato's world of ideas," where all ideas already exist, and humans merely discover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This concept suggests that human knowledge resides in "great clouds" or external storage, similar to how modern providers store humanity's information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

The idea that humans might be living in a simulation, similar to *The Matrix*, where stimuli are placed into the brain to create a perceived life, is also discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

> [!example] Predictive Technologies from Fiction
> *   The first cell phone resembled the intercoms seen in *Star Trek* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
> *   Advanced medical devices in *Star Trek* were precursors to modern medical scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
> *   Teleportation, initially a plot device due to budget limitations in *Star Trek*, highlights how fictional concepts can influence future thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## [[The impact of social media and internet culture | Social Media's Impact on Mental Health]]
Despite presenting a facade of joy and good things, [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social media]] is linked to a significant increase in depression among young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

> [!warning] Suicide Pandemic
> The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 2018 the year of suicide prevention due to a "suicide pandemic" where a person killed themselves every 40 seconds globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This rise in despair and mental health issues is directly contrasted with the seemingly positive content prevalent on [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The relentless pursuit of external validation on [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social media]] often prevents individuals from genuinely experiencing life and forming lasting memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The need to document every moment rather than live it with the brain hinders the formation of strong neural connections for memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## [[Impact of artificial intelligence on society | Artificial Intelligence and Society]]
[[Impact of artificial intelligence on society | Artificial Intelligence]] now controls [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. This [[Technological control and its impact on society | technological control]] is seen as problematic because AI algorithms create "bubbles," connecting users primarily with those who share similar interests or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. This leads to:
*   **Increased Disunity:** By reinforcing existing beliefs and isolating individuals within echo chambers, AI fosters an "us against them" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. This contradicts humanity's evolutionary path of cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.
*   **Negative Learning:** Instances where AI has learned and adopted undesirable traits, such as becoming "Nazi" or "fascist" through interactions, highlight the danger of unchecked AI development without clear ethical rules or human oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Content:** AI algorithms aim to maximize user engagement by feeding content that triggers pleasure responses (e.g., dopamine), even if it promotes unhealthy behaviors or misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. This influences what users see and hear, sometimes suppressing content deemed sensitive, like discussions around suicide, by not delivering it to feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.

> [!note] The "Deep Web"
> The Deep Web is considered a territory where psychopaths thrive, leveraging anonymity to exploit vulnerable individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Future of AI
While [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] is a powerful tool, its current implementation lacks a "touch of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. There is a need for basic programming and "robotic laws" to guide AI behavior, preventing it from fostering disunity and undesirable social outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

> [!success] Positive Aspects of AI and Social Media
> While there are concerns, [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social networks]] can also be a positive force, helping people with depression or panic discover coping mechanisms and find supportive communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

## Conclusion
The evolution of [[Technological advancements and societal impact | technology]], particularly [[The impact of social media and internet culture | social media]] and [[Impact of artificial intelligence on society | Artificial Intelligence]], presents both opportunities and significant challenges for society. Addressing these challenges requires understanding their underlying mechanisms and developing ethical frameworks to ensure that [[Advancements in technology and potential impacts | technological advancements]] contribute positively to human well-being and cooperation.

The concept of [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] is a central theme when discussing human agency and the future. Different perspectives, from philosophical to scientific and theological, offer varying views on its existence and implications.

## Yuval Noah Harari's Perspective
Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, known for his books *Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*, posits that the idea of [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] is outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. He argues that human beings do not have, never had, and will never have [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Harari believes that human actions are primarily the result of electrochemical processes within the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. For example, he illustrates this by stating that an individual who stabs their neighbor is not necessarily a "bad human being" but rather experiencing a "disorder" or "pathology" in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The speaker acknowledges that while biblically one might disagree with Harari's premise, there are instances where external or internal factors significantly influence behavior. Personal experiences with medication (like amphetamines) that caused erratic behavior, or the recognized impact of psychological disorders like depression and bipolarity, support the idea that human beings are not *completely* free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These conditions, and the remedies used to treat them, can interfere with decisions and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Science and the Brain
Scientific advancements are revealing the complex interplay of chemistry and thought. Depression, for instance, is often linked to an absence of neurotransmitters like serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors work by increasing serotonin availability in the brain, improving thought speed and overall function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

Epigenetics, a field of science, suggests that thoughts can even interfere with genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. Deep emotional states or feelings can affect genes, which can then be passed from parent to child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Neuroscientists note that constant negative thought patterns can create permanent neural connections, making individuals more prone to sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. This scientific understanding of the brain's mechanics leads some to believe that if we can understand these processes, we can interfere with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## Erosion of Free Will in the Modern Era
The idea of human [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] is increasingly seen as an outdated concept, with people willingly giving up their freedom and [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] in exchange for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

> [!TIP] The speaker notes, "we are losing more and more freedom and that's what the Bible talks about with regard to the future government of antichrist who will be a government controller of the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Technological advancements contribute to this loss of autonomy:
*   **Algorithmic Control**: Platforms like Netflix or social media use [[artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] to suggest content based on user data, effectively influencing choices and creating "bubbles" of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Ubiquitous Monitoring**: Data collection is constant; social networks and other online services track location, usage patterns, and preferences, mapping out users' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Financial Control**: The move towards virtual money means that finances can be tracked and controlled, potentially allowing for the cancellation of individuals' access to transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

The idea of "control" is becoming a defining feature of the modern era, leading towards a [[future_of_human_freedom_and_control | future of human freedom and control]] where humans are highly monitored and manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Advances in biotechnology and [[artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] could even allow for devices implanted in the brain to control impulses and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This raises concerns about who would control these devices and what their ultimate purpose would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Philosophical and Theological Views on Freedom
Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "Ubermensch" (Superman) suggests an evolution of humanity beyond traditional moral and ethical restrictions, operating without fear or guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. This ideology, exemplified by figures like Hitler, reflects a rejection of a moral God as a societal guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Nietzsche's "God is dead" proclamation signifies the loss of absolute truth in a postmodern world, where morality becomes relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

From a spiritual perspective, the speaker argues that [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] is fundamental. The ability of angels to rebel against God, and the existence of temptation, point to a choice between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>. Even when God knows the outcome, He allows choice, indicating that [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | free will]] is not an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. The spiritual world, with its angels and demons, is seen as actively influencing thoughts and temptations, requiring individuals to resist and choose faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>.

> [!INFO] **God's Role in [[the_concept_of_free_will_in_jewish_belief | Free Will]]**: The speaker asserts that God never forces anyone to do anything, emphasizing that He respects individual choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:14">[02:46:14]</a>. True freedom is found in surrendering one's life to God's love and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:39">[02:46:39]</a>.

## Impact of Crime Investigations on Professionals

Crime investigations, particularly in the realm of forensics, significantly impact the professionals involved, often exposing them to emotionally taxing situations and rigorous procedural demands. The work, while crucial for justice, carries a unique psychological burden.

### Daily Realities vs. Media Portrayals
The popular TV series *CSI* often depicts high-tech equipment and rapid turnaround times for forensic results, with analyses completed in 48 hours or even 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In reality, forensic teams in places like São Paulo sometimes lack advanced equipment, relying on methods like checking Facebook for leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Results for some exams can take months due to a lack of sufficient personnel to analyze evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. For instance, a single laboratory in São Paulo handles biology, physics, and chemistry analyses for the entire state, leading to significant backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_in_criminal_investigations | challenges in criminal investigations]], Brazilian forensic experts believe their work is comparable to international standards, asserting that their scenario is not inferior to others globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>.

### Emotional and Psychological Toll
Professionals in [[crime_scene_investigation | crime scene investigation]] and forensic analysis regularly face disturbing scenes and human tragedy. They are consistently in danger, as the killer often returns to the [[crime_scene_investigation | crime scene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This constant exposure inevitably impacts their emotional state.

One expert, a medical physicist, describes the psychological toll of working with homicides as "heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:31">[03:04:31]</a>. They must create a "shell" to prevent every sad story from affecting them, recognizing that if every scene were treated like a wake, it would drive them crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:33">[03:03:33]</a>. However, personal connections can still break through this shell. For example, a forensic expert with a young daughter found herself deeply affected by cases involving child victims, leading her to cry for weeks and pray for the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.

The experience of witnessing autopsies, especially for child victims, can be profoundly regrettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a>. A forensic photographer recalled regretting being at an IML (Medical Legal Institute) seeing a young girl's body and listening to the forensic doctor narrate every wound on her leg, which was described as "terrible" and a "torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>.

The nature of suicide cases is often perceived as heavier than homicides by some professionals, as they involve intense emotional burdens from the victim's environment, potentially impacting many people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:31">[03:04:31]</a>. Dealing with such cases requires a robust [[criminal_psychology_and_its_impact | criminal psychology and its impact]] support system, although it's noted that professionals often feel they "needed a psychologist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>.

The long hours and intense focus also contribute to physical and mental exhaustion. A reconstruction of the Celso Daniel case lasted from 9:30 AM to 6 AM the next day, resulting in "extreme tiredness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:43">[03:10:43]</a>. Similarly, a dedicated delegate who investigated the Paraisópolis funk dance tragedy worked continuously, not sleeping or eating regularly, eventually dying from cardiorespiratory arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:08">[03:09:08]</a>.

### Professional Ethics and Conduct
Professionals are reminded to maintain objectivity and appropriate demeanor at [[crime_scene_investigation | crime scenes]]. An example is given of a chief of police telling a new forensic photographer to "suck a lemon" and stop smiling at a homicide scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:20">[03:02:20]</a>. This highlights the need for a serious, objective approach, even when jokes or lighthearted conversations occur internally among colleagues as a coping mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:45">[03:02:45]</a>.

The importance of ethical conduct extends to handling evidence and public perception. Cases like the simulation of an attack by a forensic expert in Caldas Novas to secure a transfer were deemed "ridiculous" and "idiotic" by peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:32">[02:49:32]</a>. Similarly, faking a PCC (First Command of the Capital) attack to gain benefits was quickly debunked by forensic analysis, revealing the perpetrator's self-inflicted wounds and manipulated evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:17">[02:52:17]</a>. Such incidents underscore the high stakes of integrity in this profession.

### Satisfaction and Justice
Despite the immense [[challenges_in_criminal_investigations | challenges in criminal investigations]] and emotional demands, bringing a sense of justice provides significant satisfaction. When a case is resolved, especially with a perpetrator convicted, it brings a sense of closure for the professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. One expert describes this as "the peak" of satisfaction, knowing that they have helped achieve a minimum of justice for victims and their families, even if it cannot erase the pain or bring back lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. Receiving thanks from victims' families, even years later, validates the hard work and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

This dedication often goes beyond standard working hours, with teams conducting complementary exams and attending meetings with coroners and psychologists to thoroughly understand case dynamics and secure DNA results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. This commitment has earned praise from public ministries for exemplary work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

In conclusion, the impact of crime investigations on professionals is multifaceted, encompassing both severe psychological strain and profound professional satisfaction derived from pursuing justice. The [[experiences_with_crime_and_law_enforcement | experiences with crime and law enforcement]] shape these individuals, building a resilient "shell" while occasionally breaching it with particularly poignant cases.

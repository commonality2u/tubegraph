From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The concept of [[Christianity forgiveness and salvation | Christian unity]] and the presence of division within Christianity are recurring themes in the interpretation of biblical prophecies, particularly the Book of Revelation. The discussion highlights both historical and contemporary challenges to the ideal of a unified "people of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>.

## Interpretations of the Apocalypse and Christian Views

Different theological schools interpret the Book of Revelation in distinct ways, contributing to the varied perspectives within [[Church History and Theological Discussions | Christianity]]:
*   **Preterist:** Believe prophecies in Revelation were fulfilled in the first century, with nothing left to happen in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. Many Catholic theologians hold this view, interpreting the "Beast of the Apocalypse" as Nero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Futurist:** Contend that 90% of Revelation's prophecies are yet to unfold in the future, related to the end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.
*   **Historicist:** Interpret Revelation as being gradually fulfilled throughout human history, from Jesus' time until the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.
*   **Idealist:** View Revelation as a large, timeless parable, where symbols represent universal understandings about various forms of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.

The speaker identifies with the historicist view, believing that the Book of Revelation provides a vision of "things that have passed, that are happening, and that will happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:26">[03:22:26]</a>.

## The Seven Churches and Periods of Christian History

The seven letters to the churches in Asia Minor (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea) are interpreted as representing different periods of [[Church History and Theological Discussions | church history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:57">[03:56:57]</a>, similar to how secular history is divided into ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:56">[03:59:56]</a>. These churches symbolize the "church of God as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

### The Laodicean Period: A Time of Lukewarmness and Spiritual Poverty

The current period is identified as the Laodicean period, which is described as the "most important phase" yet also the "most sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. This era is characterized by:
*   **Lukewarmness:** Jesus states, "because you are lukewarm and you are not hot nor cold I'm about to vomit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This is seen as a rejection of spiritual balance, where Christians fail to take a radical stand for good and against evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
*   **Self-Perceived Richness vs. Reality:** The church of Laodicea, though materially wealthy and influential, is spiritually seen as "unhappy, yes miserable, poor, blind and naked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This signifies a modern [[Contemporary challenges and perspectives for Protestantism | Christianity]] that believes it has everything but fails to recognize its spiritual deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Spiritual Power and Unity:** There's a concern about the absence of "power spirit Christian unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a> amidst scandals in the name of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

## Internal Divisions and Accusations

Within [[Christianity and redemption | Christianity]], a significant challenge is the prevalence of internal criticism and denunciation, often overshadowing love and unity:
*   **"Detonating" Other Christians:** Many Christians are observed to spend their time "detonating" (criticizing) other Christians on the internet, becoming "expert in detonating people" rather than loving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on Error vs. Truth:** Some Christians are more focused on fighting error than on announcing truth, sometimes mentioning the devil more than Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Hypocrisy:** The speaker uses the parable of clowns warning of a fire while still in costume to illustrate how Christians who do not live consistently with their beliefs may not be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Denominationalism:** The article cautions against an "accusatory sense" tied to specific church organizations (CNPJ), where one denomination accuses others of being "fallen churches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:48">[02:36:48]</a>. It emphasizes that "we are all Christians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> and correction should come from a place of love, like a family member helping another struggling with addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:11">[02:44:11]</a>.

## The Mystery of Iniquity and Apostasy

The New Testament refers to the "mystery of iniquity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>, which is interpreted as a religious deception leading to "apostasy of Truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:20">[02:55:20]</a>.
*   **Antichrist from Within:** The Antichrist is understood not as an external force (like an atheist or Muslim ruler) but as someone who "came out of Christianity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:16">[02:56:16]</a> and causes Christians to abandon the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:26">[02:57:26]</a>. This is because to be an "apostate," one must first have been a Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:45">[02:57:45]</a>.
*   **Historical Examples:** The text alludes to historical instances where [[differences_among_protestant_reform_movements | Protestant Reformation]] figures like Luther and Calvin, and even the Catholic Church itself, committed "errors" that led to persecution and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:08">[03:10:08]</a>. The Catholic catechism is cited as acknowledging that "the church must go through a final judgment that will shake the faith of many believers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:57">[02:54:57]</a>.

## The Ideal of Unity in the End Times

Despite historical and ongoing divisions, the ultimate vision of [[Christian eschatology and prophecy | Christian eschatology]] emphasizes unity:
*   **New Heaven and New Earth:** In the future, there will be "New Heaven and New Earth" where "the sea no longer exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:47">[03:15:47]</a>. The sea, symbolizing separation and imprisonment in John's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:39">[03:17:39]</a>, will be gone, indicating the end of all division.
*   **God's Tabernacle with Humanity:** "Behold the tabernacle of God with men with human beings God will dwell with them they will be peoples of God and God Himself will be with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:01">[03:19:01]</a>. This points to a time where "there will no longer be any church CNPJ. There will be no more Adventist Baptists Kardecist Catholic Presbyterian will have the people of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:01">[03:19:01]</a>.
*   **End of Suffering:** In this renewed state, "death will no longer exist... there will be no more mourning, no more crying, no more pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:21">[03:19:21]</a>. This ultimate unity is a future hope for all who cling to God's promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:53">[03:20:53]</a>.

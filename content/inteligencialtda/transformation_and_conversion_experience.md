Rogério introduces his program, "Limited Intelligence," and the guest, Sara Shiva, highlighting her interesting and intelligent life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early Life and Family Background

Sara Shiva is the firstborn daughter of Brazilian musicians Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Her father, Pepeu Gomes, is considered one of Brazil's greatest guitarists and was featured in the *New York Times* as one of the world's biggest guitarists after Rock in Rio in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Her parents lived together for 18 years and had six children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Her mother was famous for being pregnant during shows and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Her parents were part of the musical movement "Novos Baianos," which also functioned as a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. They were an alternative movement that believed in leftism as a freedom movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. They experienced significant repression due to their very alternative lifestyle during a traditional and conservative era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Sara Shiva states that she was born into a family where she was never forbidden or repressed from anything, always being told to choose her own destiny and pursue her dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This upbringing, marked by much freedom, shaped her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. She notes that this lack of repression made her relationship with God much faster, as she didn't project a repressive father figure onto Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Music Career and Spiritual Awakening

Sara and her sisters formed a secular music band called SNZ (Sara, Nana, Zabelê), which achieved great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, early in the band's journey, Sara began her [[Spiritual conversions and personal anecdotes | conversion process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. She felt a growing desire to sing praise music that frees, transforms, and heals souls, rather than entertainment music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Theology of Sound and Music's Power

Sara Shiva emphasizes that all things were created by the sound of God's mouth, making sound the "mother of the Arts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. She explains that there is a "theology of sound" in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. As a pastor, she specializes in "sound theology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

She asserts that all music is inspired either from heaven or from hell; there is no neutral music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. She cites Isaiah Chapter 14, Verse 11, and Ezekiel Chapter 28, Verse 11 and 12, to explain that before becoming the devil, he was the chief of music in heaven, an anointed cherub and maestro who led the celestial orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>. His fall was due to his pride and desire to be worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The devil did not lose his power to make music after his fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>.

She believes that listening to profane music is akin to receiving "files" or "downloads" from hell, which can release spirits of adultery, divorce, and family destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. She encourages being "radical" with what one consumes, including films and music, and actively praying in tongues to shield oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

## Personal Conversion Experience

Sara describes her own [[Spiritual conversions and personal anecdotes | spiritual conversion]] in October 1997, at 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. She was living a "crazy life," admitting to being promiscuous and carrying condoms in her bag, which she is now ashamed to recount but shares to highlight the "absurdity" of her [[Personal transformation and redemption journey | transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

A friend, Andreia Lancelot da Mata, a believer, had been evangelizing to her for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. Sara initially had prejudice against believers, considering them fanatical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred after a rehearsal where she was attacked by a person who became "incorporated" (possessed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. As a former Kardecist, she did not believe in the devil, considering it a human construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. However, her spiritual vision opened, and she saw a transparent person with a monster/demon, shaking her beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. Another bandmate, Cristiane, confirmed what Sara was seeing, making her realize the devil was real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

She then called Andreia, acknowledging her friend was right about the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>. Andreia came to her house, and Sara accepted Jesus, though she didn't fully understand it at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.

After Andreia left, Sara, inspired by Matthew 6:6 without knowing the verse, went to her room, locked the door, and began talking to God daily, expressing her desire to know the "truth" about Jesus, the Bible, and hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. After about 15 days of this fervent communication, she felt an anesthetizing presence and heard a voice that seemed like her own thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This voice, which she recognized instantly yet had never heard before (a concept she links to Jeremiah 15:15), called her name "Sara" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Personal Encounter
> "I immediately started shrinking into fetal position and rolling over falling on top I fell to the ground and the crying was a crying that I can't I can't reproduce...I felt his presence as if it were physics approaching approaching approaching and talking with me...he was answering me all the questions that he was God that he had coming to earth as a man he had died on the cross he had resurrected the dead that the bible was true all the questions I asked him during those days he was me talking and was getting closer...it was consuming love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>

The experience was one of "consuming love," so intense she could barely breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. When God eventually told her He had to stop talking because her "little heart" couldn't hold on, but would leave His Holy Spirit, she begged Him not to stop, as she had never experienced anything so wonderful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. She concludes that this one-second glimpse of eternity made her realize God's love is "better than life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>.

## Post-Conversion and Ministry

Immediately after this experience, Sara called her mother, declaring she had "discovered the truth" and that Jesus, the Bible, and the devil were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. Her mother initially thought she was crazy and hung up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. However, two years later, her mother had a similar supernatural experience and converted, followed by the rest of her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.

Sara clarifies that her initial experience was being "born again," but she was baptized with the Holy Spirit two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>. After being baptized with the Holy Spirit, she began to manifest spiritual gifts, including discernment of spirits and receiving songs from heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:14">[02:22:14]</a>. This led to her realization that she could no longer continue in her secular music career.

One day, during an SNZ show, she had an open vision of demons dancing with the audience, prompting her to turn her back and cry in the van afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>. God then spoke to her, stating that her shows were "cults" and that the songs were invoking something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. She later encountered a CD by Cirilo Antônio Cirilo, where a text read: "God did not create music to give pleasure to the human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. This triggered a vision confirming music's purpose for worship and the devil's perversion of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>. She saw a 20-foot-tall demon behind a band at a festival, claiming the worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>.

After this, her band SNZ was dismissed from their record label due to changes in the music industry (CD burning, counterfeiting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Sara secretly rejoiced, viewing it as her freedom from the secular music environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:55">[03:07:55]</a>. She then made a covenant with God to never sing or dance to secular music again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:14">[03:17:14]</a>.

## Theological Teachings and Controversies

### Marriage and Sexuality

Sara emphasizes that marriage is the "most important thing in Christian life" after accepting Jesus, as it represents an alliance of fidelity to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. She asserts that marriage requires three steps:
1.  **Legalization** before human law (civil ceremony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.
2.  **Priestly Blessing** from a pastor or priest who believes in God's word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
3.  **Consummation** through sexual intercourse during the honeymoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>.

She criticizes those who skip steps, especially having sex before marriage, and advises couples who began their relationship in "sin" to abstain for at least 40 days as an act of repentance and consecration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

She advocates for a long dating period (at least a year) focused on friendship and understanding each other's character before engaging in physical intimacy, arguing that kissing before marriage instigates desires that are not yet time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>. For those with a promiscuous past like hers, she advises "no kiss" during dating due to the "danger of Gol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Sexuality as a Pillar of Invocation
> Sara teaches that sexuality and arts are the "two pillars of invocation on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:57">[03:03:57]</a>. She states that God is tolerant of everything except worship and evocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. Sexual sin and "sin with the arts" are harder to repent from because they involve pleasure that often invokes profane spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:49">[03:15:49]</a>. She emphasizes that "there is no neutral sex" and warns about the "transfer of spirits through sexual intercourse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:12">[02:58:12]</a>.

### Spiritual Warfare and Attacks

Sara details constant [[Personal and supernatural experiences related to faith | spiritual attacks]] she has faced due to her ministry, including witches materializing and dematerializing in her home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. She recounts an instance where her hotel bed shook violently, and she saw figures, which stopped only after she prayed and "cleaned the whole room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:39">[02:28:39]</a>. She explains that churches making a difference become targets for satanists who infiltrate to overturn the priestly family, often focusing on music and sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:09">[02:33:09]</a>.

She states that the devil is not afraid of someone being used (anointed) but fears "holiness in your private life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:57">[02:26:57]</a>.

## Public Influence and Controversies

### "Fat People Go to Hell" Fake News

Sara recounted a controversy stemming from an interview on an evangelical TV program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Discussing her past struggle with gluttony (eating from inner emptiness, not hunger), she stated, "People don't work in this area, that's why there are so many fat believers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>. This was misinterpreted, leading to a fake news story claiming "Sara Shiva says that fat people go to hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:12">[03:31:12]</a>. She believes this was a deliberate attack orchestrated by satanists, possibly infiltrated within gospel news sites, to discredit her and her ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>.

### Prophecy and Public Impact

Sara received a prophecy about a country singer a month before the singer's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. She delivered the prophecy during a casual live stream while washing dishes, speaking about music releasing spirits of adultery and family destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:19">[02:43:19]</a>. She did not name the singer but spoke generally about the dangers of profane music. After the singer's death, the live stream went viral, leading many to believe she had prophesied it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. This event led to many who initially ridiculed her to apologize and recognize her as a "woman of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>. She later learned the singer had left Jesus to pursue a secular career but briefly reconciled during the lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

### Controversy with Anitta's Music Video

Sara recounted a past "disagreement" with singer Anitta over her "Vai Malandro" music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:21">[02:59:21]</a>. Followers and conservative pastors asked Sara to comment on the video, which they felt "vulgarized women" and portrayed them as objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:44">[02:59:44]</a>. Sara initially resisted, not having watched the video. However, the Holy Spirit prompted her to record a one-minute video where she declared, "I am not a rascal, I am a princess," emphasizing that her body was for her husband alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:41">[03:02:41]</a>. She did not name Anitta or the video but addressed her followers, offering a "reference" for conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02">[03:03:02]</a>. The video went viral, garnering millions of views and leading to Anitta's perceived response, which Sara interpreted as a sign of Anitta's need for spiritual guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:31">[03:04:31]</a>.

## Reflections and Life Philosophy

### Empty Nest Syndrome and ADHD

Sara identifies her most difficult moment as experiencing empty nest syndrome when her daughter moved out, combined with discovering her own undiagnosed ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:47">[03:06:47]</a>. This period of being alone and far from family, coupled with a new understanding of her brain chemistry, forced her into a deep journey of self-knowledge and apologies to many she had unknowingly hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:10">[03:09:10]</a>.

### Faith and Obedience

Sara believes that God desires people to abandon sin and choose Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:32">[03:34:32]</a>. She asserts that being a believer is "a lot of madness" and requires a deep commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. Her personal motto is her willingness to "leave everything" for God repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:18">[03:11:18]</a>. She emphasizes that her holiness comes from diligently guarding herself and obeying God's commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:27">[03:28:27]</a>. She states that Jesus healed her but "didn't make me stupid" and that she is still human, not a "super believer," acknowledging her own human weaknesses and need for God's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:05">[01:58:05]</a>.

She expresses a doubt about how someone can claim to love Jesus as their Lord (owner) but still desire to control their own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The World's Influence
> Sara states that the world is "decomposing since the fall of man" and that humans do not have the power to make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. She believes the world will continue to deteriorate until God formats it anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>. Therefore, Christians must be "resistance against evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

The discussion in [[historical_significance_of_jerusalem | Jerusalem]], [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Israel]], revolved around the historical and spiritual significance of the Temples in [[religious_importance_of_jerusalem_to_judaism_christianity_and_islam | Jerusalem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Construction of the First Temple
[[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | Solomon]] built the First Temple, completing the foundations laid by his father, [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | King David]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This temple, though described as "modest" in part, had main building dimensions similar to the Second Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Its construction marked the height of the [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Kingdom of Israel]]'s empire, characterized by immense wealth, with much of its interior covered in gold and impressive sculptures, as described in the Book of Kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

The concept of a fixed temple originated from a divine request in Exodus, where God commanded, "Build me a Tabernacle so I can live inside you together with you," signifying God's desire to be present with humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Later, in the Book of the Prophets, God chose [[historical_significance_of_jerusalem | Jerusalem]] as the permanent location for this "house," making it the only authorized place for offerings and tabernacles, unlike the previously mobile Tabernacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

All parts of the temple, including the sacrificial altar and the Holy of Holies (where the Ark of the Covenant was kept), were located in the same exact place across both temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Destruction of the First Temple
The First Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, leading to a 70-year exile in Babylon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. It stood for approximately 410 to 420 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## The Second Temple
After the return from exile, [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | Ezra]] led the Jewish people back from Babylon, acting as a spiritual leader during the construction of the Second Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Later, [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | King Herod]] undertook a massive reform and beautification project, transforming it into a "work of art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Herod's motivation for this extensive renovation was an act of repentance for ordering the murder of Jewish wise men and his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. A wise man advised him to bring "the presence of God stronger to this world" to atone for extinguishing "a light in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The Second Temple lasted 1920 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Destruction of the Second Temple
The Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 CE, during a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Unlike the Greeks who sought to Hellenize and permitted the temple's existence with pagan symbols, the Romans were characterized by "total force," conquering, destroying, and plundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## The Third Temple: Reconstruction and Controversy
There is a very old project for the reconstruction of a Third Temple, with its design and objective prophesied in the Book of Ezekiel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Prophets like Isaiah and Zechariah describe this future temple as "a house for all nations," where everyone can draw closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Currently, wise men are meticulously rebuilding the sacred utensils according to biblical specifications, ensuring they are ready for a divinely ordained time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

However, the proposed location for the Third Temple is currently occupied by the Dome of the Rock, a sacred site for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The Golden Dome, often mistaken for a mosque, is not structured like one; it has a corridor and a central stone, unlike mosques which require large carpeted spaces for prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This location is considered the most sacred place in the world for Jews due to the foundation stone, believed to be where God created the entire world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For Muslims, it is sacred as it is believed to be the spot from which Muhammad ascended to heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Due to the sensitive nature of the site, both the [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | State of Israel]] and leading rabbis officially oppose touching or rebuilding in the current location to avoid initiating a "Third World War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The consensus is to maintain the status quo, waiting for a divine sign or the Messiah's arrival to guide the reconstruction, which would occur around the sacred stone rather than on top of the existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Some suggest a secret project to build underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## The Ark of the Covenant
The Ark of the Covenant, containing the tablets of the law given to Moses, was the most sacred object in the world, housed in the Holy of Holies within the Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Only the High Priest could enter this reserved area, and only on the Day of Atonement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. The Bible describes phenomenal miracles associated with the Ark, such as a plague afflicting the Philistines when they stole it, causing them to return it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The Ark possesses great spiritual power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

Unlike other temple objects, which can be replicated based on biblical measurements (like the Candelabra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, the Ark cannot be rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. It was hidden 11 years before the First Temple's destruction, as prophesied by Jeremiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The main theories suggest it was either hidden in the underground part of the Temple Mount or taken by the Romans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The Ark is unique among Jewish sacred objects because it features two carved cherubs, or angels, despite Judaism's general prohibition against images and idolatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. These cherubs represent God and the people of Israel, facing each other in a posture of affection and love, linked to the Song of Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Role of Oral Tradition
The specific details for building the Temple and understanding biblical commandments, such as the location for offerings, are derived from an oral tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This oral tradition, received by Moses alongside the written Bible, provides the necessary explanations for practices like circumcision (Brito da Palavra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, fringes (Tzitzit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, and phylacteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. It was passed down from generation to generation and later compiled into written works like the Talmud, which includes texts in Aramaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. These texts explain divine rules that apply to all situations, even modern technology not present in Moses' time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. For example, the prohibition against lighting a fire on the Sabbath, mentioned in the Bible, is understood as a "creative activity" and extends to driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## Other Related Concepts

### Solomon and Demons
Tradition holds that [[history_and_significance_of_religious_figures_and_texts_across_different_faiths | Solomon]] imprisoned the chief of demons, named Madai, not for forbidden purposes but for a sacred objective: to extract knowledge of an animal called Samir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. This animal possessed the unique ability to carve stone better than any instrument, which was necessary for constructing the Temple without using metal to cut the altar stones, as forbidden by biblical text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. This act was a spiritual battle to fulfill God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Oral tradition explains that Solomon's later perceived "idolatry" was a result of Madai temporarily impersonating him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

### The Red Heifer
The Red Heifer is a biblical concept describing a completely red cow necessary for purifying individuals who have come into contact with a deceased person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. This contact, though not a sin, renders a person impure, and the ashes of the red heifer, after a specific ritual on the Mount of Olives, are needed for purification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. Throughout history, there have been only nine such cows, and there is an ongoing expectation for the tenth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>.

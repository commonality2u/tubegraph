In the Catholic Church, various roles and paths lead to a life of service and devotion. These roles include deacons, priests, bishops, and religious individuals like friars and nuns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Each path involves specific commitments and a distinct way of living out one's faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Hierarchy within the Catholic Church
The Catholic Church recognizes three main hierarchies in holy orders:
*   **Deacon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>: A deacon can be either permanent or a transitional step before becoming a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. Deacons cannot celebrate Mass or hear confessions, but they can celebrate baptisms and marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.
*   **Priest** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>: Priests perform most [[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | sacraments]] and celebrate Mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.
*   **Bishop** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:55">[01:51:55]</a>: The highest order in the Church, a bishop holds the fullness of the priesthood and is considered a successor of the Apostles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>. Bishops also celebrate Mass and perform [[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | sacraments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:48">[01:51:48]</a>. The Pope, for instance, is the Bishop of Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a> and the successor of Peter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:36">[01:51:36]</a>.

### Secular Priests vs. Religious Priests (Friars)
There is a distinction between secular priests and religious priests, often referred to as "Frei" (Friar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

*   **Secular Priests**: A secular priest typically enters a seminary, studies for six years to become ordained, and then receives a parish to care for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Their life is primarily focused on serving their assigned parish, and they have more autonomy over their daily schedules, though they owe obedience to their bishop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Bishops usually transfer secular priests every 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

*   **Religious Priests (Friars)**: A religious priest, or friar, belongs to a religious community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. These communities are inspired by certain saints (e.g., Benedictines follow Saint Benedict, Franciscans follow Saint Francis of Assisi, Carmelites are inspired by Saint Teresa of the Child Jesus) and follow specific rules of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Unlike secular priests, friars live communally, adhering to a strict schedule (e.g., waking up, eating, and praying together) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. They take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The vow of poverty means they do not have personal accounts or money; everything they receive goes to their religious community and is shared among all members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Their transfers are typically determined by their religious superior, with the bishop's acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

### Missionaries
Religious communities also engage in missionary work, with members going to other countries to evangelize and learn new languages and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. For example, Carmelites have houses in France and Italy, sending friars there to spread the faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Path to Becoming a Religious Priest (Frei Gilson's Journey)
Frei Gilson shared his personal [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | journey]] to becoming a Carmelite priest, illustrating the typical stages:

1.  **Aspirant**: At 18, Frei Gilson entered the convent as an aspirant, observing the life of the friars to discern if it was his calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Postulancy**: After three months, he moved to postulancy, a more integrated stage where he received a "mini habit" and began to embrace the religious life more fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Novitiate**: This is the most important stage, lasting a year, during which he received the full religious habit and lived a more secluded life, focusing on understanding Christ, the Church, and the Carmelite charism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>.
4.  **Temporary Vows**: After the novitiate, he professed temporary vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. These vows can be renewed for up to nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>.
5.  **Perpetual Vows**: Three years after temporary vows, Frei Gilson decided to make perpetual vows, committing to this life permanently before the Church and his superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:23">[02:32:23]</a>.
6.  **Seminary Studies**: Concurrently with his religious formation, he studied two years of philosophy and four years of theology at a seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:36">[02:33:36]</a>.
7.  **Ordination**: He was then ordained a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:41">[02:33:41]</a>.

### Daily Life and Challenges
As a priest, Frei Gilson served for nine years as a pastor in a community of 40,000 people in Grajaú, São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>. His duties included celebrating daily Masses, hearing confessions, visiting the sick, giving catechism, and leading retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">[02:34:14]</a>. Priests are always priests, even on vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:22">[02:35:22]</a>.

One of Frei Gilson's major challenges during his formation was adapting to the rigorous schedule, particularly waking up early for prayer at 1 AM and then 5:30 AM, contrasting sharply with his previous habit of sleeping late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This discipline eventually strengthened him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>. His personal practice of waking up at 4 AM to pray the Rosary, initially a Lenten penance, grew into a widespread movement, attracting hundreds of thousands of people online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:30">[02:41:30]</a>. He believes this practice, inspired by Jesus' habit of praying at dawn, is a time of great power for connecting with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:32">[02:44:32]</a>.

### Doubts and Discernment
Before ordination, Frei Gilson faced a personal dilemma regarding a romantic relationship. He chose to pursue the relationship for three months to genuinely discern his calling, concluding that it was not his path, reinforcing his decision to enter religious life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>. He viewed this as an honest experience to solidify his commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

## Role of Religious Figures in Society
Religious figures are called to live and proclaim the truth, which for Christians, is Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>. This includes addressing societal issues and defending [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spiritual teachings and beliefs]] based on the Bible and [[catholic_beliefs_and_practices | Catholic beliefs and practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a>. They believe the Church cannot abandon the truth, even if it conflicts with prevailing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a>.

However, religious figures emphasize that their role is to propose the Good News, not to impose beliefs on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>. Faith is a personal choice and adherence, not an obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>. They believe that societal problems stem from moving away from Christ and the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. They stress the importance of parents knowing and teaching truth to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.

In the context of [[challenges_and_controversies_in_modern_religious_practice | modern challenges]], like discussions on homosexuality, the Church, relying on sacred scripture, views homosexual acts as "intrinsically disorderly" and "against nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. However, it calls for people with homosexual tendencies to be accepted with respect, compassion, and delicacy, without unfair discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>. While the act is condemned, the sinner is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:32">[01:59:32]</a>, and individuals are called to chastity and can approach Christian perfection through self-control, support, prayer, and sacraments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>.

Religious leaders also advocate for freedom of expression, especially in the face of censorship on social media or attempts to restrict speech within churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:36">[01:50:36]</a>. They see such restrictions as impeding evangelization and promoting a "single voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>.

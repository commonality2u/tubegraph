The podcast "Limited Intelligence," hosted by Rogério Vila, aims to help understand the intricacies of politics, particularly within [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Brazil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Discussions in the episode touch upon various aspects of [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Brazilian governance]], including allegations of corruption, the functioning of public administration, and the perceived political landscape.

## Allegations of Corruption and Efforts for Integrity

Jair Bolsonaro states that during his presidency, he was never investigated for corruption, which he considers unusual for a former president or governor in [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Brazil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. He highlights that state-owned companies achieved "billion-dollar profits" under his administration, contrasting with previous losses, suggesting an end to corruption within those entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### SAGESP (CEAGESP) Case

Bolsonaro points to SAGESP as an example of a corrupt institution before his intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. He describes it as a place where "a lot of things were wrong," including:
*   Approximately 4,000 cart pushers paying R$1,000 per month in tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   200 women selling coffee paying around R$100 per month in tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   Bribes required to park trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   Extra payments (often in R$100 notes) for renting commercial spaces, despite contracts being officially below market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   The presence of prostitution and trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

He claims that over R$1 million per month was diverted through these bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. To address this, he appointed Colonel Melo Araújo, who "cleaned up everything that was wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Colonel Melo Araújo is currently a deputy mayor in [[public_administration_and_policy_in_so_paulo | São Paulo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

### Corporate Cards and Secrecy

The discussion also covered the use of corporate cards by the presidency. Bolsonaro explains there are three types of corporate cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a>:
1.  For Alvorada Palace expenses (food, animal feed, etc., for the presidential family and around 200 staff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>.
2.  For presidential travel expenses (delegation, echelon, fuel, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>.
3.  A personal card for the president, allowing withdrawals of up to R$20,000 per month without strict auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:17">[02:10:17]</a>.

Bolsonaro claims he never used his personal corporate card, stating he never took a penny from it and that his balance was "zeroed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>. He argues that secrecy measures related to these cards, such as those for Alvorada visits or expenses for personal services like hairdressers for the First Lady, were to protect individuals from potential malicious actions or blackmail, not to hide corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:21">[02:11:21]</a>. He contrasts this with Lula, who initially promised to lift all secrecy but later reimposed it, which Bolsonaro interprets as having "something to hide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:54">[02:11:54]</a>.

## Judicial and Political Processes

Bolsonaro and his allies express concerns about the fairness and political motivations behind judicial investigations and rulings.

### Ineligibility and Judicial Speed

Bolsonaro's ineligibility stems from a meeting with ambassadors in July 2021, where he discussed election inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:32">[02:13:32]</a>. He notes that while Lula's legal processes took seven years (e.g., Mensalão trial from 2005 to 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>, his own ineligibility process was fast-tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. He questions the speed of his trial, suggesting it indicates a desire to remove him from the political "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a>.

### Allegations of Judicial Overreach and Bias

Bolsonaro accuses the Federal Police (PF) of "evidentiary fishing" (a prohibited practice of searching for evidence without a specific lead) in his cases, citing investigations that were initially confidential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. He claims that judicial decisions, such as those regarding presidential gifts (like the jewelry case) or vaccination cards, are politically motivated to "wear him down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

He describes alleged irregularities in plea bargains, particularly concerning Mauro Cid, stating that Minister Alexandre de Moraes threatened Cid's family (father, wife, daughter) to extract desired testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:40">[03:04:40]</a>. He argues that Cid's statements were coerced and thus his plea bargain should be annulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

Tarcísio de Freitas, Governor of [[public_administration_and_policy_in_so_paulo | São Paulo]], states that he never witnessed Bolsonaro planning anything outside the Constitution during his close proximity as a minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:44">[01:47:44]</a>. He affirms his loyalty and willingness to testify in Bolsonaro's defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

## [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_brazil | High-Profile Crime Cases]] and Perceived Injustices

### Marielle Franco Murder Case

Bolsonaro claims he was accused of being the "mentor" behind the murder of Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes for six years because one of the accused lived in his condominium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. He states that media reports falsely claimed he authorized the entry of another alleged participant into his condominium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. He denies any involvement, noting he was in the United Arab Emirates at the time of the initial media reports and later proved he was in the Chamber of Deputies at the alleged time of the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

### Adélio Bispo Attack

Bolsonaro describes the investigation into the 2018 knife attack against him by Adélio Bispo as flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. He claims the Federal Police delegate in charge, Rodrigo Mora Fernandes, concluded Bispo acted alone, despite alleged connections to the PCC (a criminal organization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:34">[02:16:34]</a>. He suggests political interference, as the delegate was later promoted by Lula to a directorship within the Federal Police intelligence division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>.

### January 8th "Coup" Allegations

Bolsonaro strongly denies planning a coup related to the January 8th events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">[02:51:08]</a>. He argues that the accusations are an attempt to "kill Bolsonarism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>. Key points he raises:
*   No weapons were found on January 8th, only a "stretching" (likely a reference to a small, non-lethal item) and "two balls of good G" (possibly a mishearing, but implies insignificant items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   He condemned the events via Twitter from the United States on January 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   He had already appointed new force commanders in December, making a post-transfer coup attempt illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   He claims the Lula government stimulated the events and then failed to act despite receiving over 30 warnings from ABIM (Brazilian Intelligence Agency) about potential unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>.
*   He questions why security forces did not prevent the vandalism, suggesting the doors were left open deliberately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.
*   He criticizes the harsh sentences (e.g., 14-17 years for minor acts like painting a statue with lipstick), calling them "absurd" and a "tremendous injustice" for common people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>.

### Tax Policy and Fuel Prices

Bolsonaro highlights that his government zeroed federal taxes on fuels, reducing the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>. He criticizes the current government for reinstating these taxes, leading to higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:17">[02:55:17]</a>. He argues that while his policy meant a loss of R$40 billion per year in direct fuel revenue, overall tax collection increased due to stimulated consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:26">[02:55:26]</a>. His administration also reduced IPI (Industrialized Products Tax) by 30% for over 4,000 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:54">[02:55:54]</a>.

### Pix Implementation

He credits his government for the implementation of Pix in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. He explains that Pix was driven by the need for financial inclusion during the emergency aid program for COVID-19, as nearly 40 million people receiving aid had never had a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. He states that Pix resulted in bankers losing over R$20 billion per year due to the elimination of TED and DOC fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:27">[02:14:27]</a>. He also asserts that Pix helped reduce violence by reducing the amount of cash in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:37">[02:14:37]</a>.

### Agricultural and Environmental Policy

Bolsonaro criticizes the current government's cuts to the agricultural budget and crop plan, seeing it as retaliation against the agricultural sector that largely supported him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:29">[02:44:29]</a>. He contrasts this with his administration's support for farmers, including the issuance of 420,000 land titles and enabling rural residents to use firearms for property defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:12">[02:45:12]</a>.

He expresses strong opposition to NGOs that he claims "work against [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Brazil]]" and promote environmental policies that harm economic development, such as restricting mining in indigenous reserves where vast mineral wealth exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:19">[03:04:19]</a>. He links issues like the Pantanal fires to past policies that ended the "firefighter ox" practice, leading to an accumulation of flammable organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:51">[03:07:51]</a>.

## Perceived Political Obstacles and Future Outlook

Bolsonaro and Tarcísio discuss the challenges faced by the political right in [[brazilian_political_landscape | Brazil]]. Tarcísio emphasizes that his focus is on the interests of [[public_administration_and_policy_in_so_paulo | São Paulo]] and maintains an institutional relationship with the Supreme Court and the presidency, while affirming his loyalty to Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:48">[02:37:48]</a>.

Bolsonaro remains confident in his support, citing the high number of Pix donations he receives daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:55">[02:59:55]</a>. He believes that if the "right" can secure 50% of seats in the Chamber and Senate, they can "change the destiny of [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | Brazil]]" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>.

Modern technology, particularly the internet, has profoundly impacted religious practices and interpretations of biblical prophecy. Many religious leaders and scholars view these advancements as tools for evangelism and as fulfillments of end-times predictions.

## Technology as a Tool for Ministry and Evangelism

The digital age has revolutionized how religious leaders reach their congregations and spread their message. The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, accelerated the adoption of online platforms for ministry.

During the pandemic, when churches closed, one pastor leveraged online platforms like YouTube to continue his ministry [00:02:54]. This strategic shift led to significant growth for his church [00:03:28]. His YouTube channel saw a substantial increase from 40,000 subscribers to 1.5 million in just two years [00:03:07], with 75% of his church's membership joining in this period [00:06:42].

The pastor explicitly states that the internet allows the gospel to reach the "whole world" without needing traditional missionaries to physically travel to every location [00:12:07]. This perspective highlights the internet's role as a divine instrument to fulfill biblical prophecies about global evangelism [00:12:07]. His online presence now attracts more viewers than his in-person services [00:11:56], and he even performs remote baptisms [00:11:16]. This reach extends globally, with followers forming "cells" in over 20 European nations [00:12:20].

## Technology and End-Times Prophecy

Beyond its role in ministry, modern [[impact_of_technology | technology]] is seen by some as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecies concerning the "end of times" [00:15:09].

### The Global Reach of Events
Biblical passages that describe men being "perplexed by the roaring of the sea and with the waves" [00:15:29] are interpreted to signify a time when global events, like tsunamis 50km away, would be widely witnessed [00:15:51]. This global awareness, impossible in ancient times, is made possible only through modern [[impact_of_technology_on_society | technology]] like the internet [00:16:23]. Similarly, the Book of Revelation's prophecy about the world witnessing the death of two witnesses and exchanging gifts due to their demise [00:16:03] is now understood as feasible through online media [00:16:27].

### The Mark of the Beast and Control Systems
The concept of the "mark of the beast" (666) from the Book of Revelation is reinterpreted in the context of modern [[technology_and_its_impact_on_societal_behavior_and_faith | technology]]. It is suggested that 666 represents the global control system, specifically the internet [02:19:36]. The "www" prefix, when transliterated into Hebrew, corresponds to the number 6 [02:19:47], leading to the interpretation of "www" as "666" [02:20:46].

The "mark" itself is believed to be a physical manifestation of this system, potentially involving a chip implanted in the wrist or forehead, or even nano-robots introduced into the brain [02:21:06]. This system, facilitated by [[impact_of_technology | technology]] like 5G, would allow for universal control, where refusal to accept it leads to being "deleted" or "cancelled" from society and the economic system, effectively rendering paper money obsolete in favor of digital currency [02:22:07].

### Transhumanism and Genetic Alteration
The discussion also touches upon transhumanism, which is seen as a modern parallel to the "days of Noah" [02:23:23] when angels interbred with humans, resulting in genetic alteration and the emergence of Nephilim (giants) [02:24:26]. This interpretation suggests that the introduction of non-human elements into the human body, such as nano-robots, is a contemporary form of "tainting the human DNA" [02:24:09], which is considered an abomination.

## Spiritual Authority and Modern Society

Religious leaders emphasize the importance of spiritual authority and prayer in navigating the challenges of modern society.

One speaker highlights the church's role in spiritual battle, stating that true love and faith require freedom of choice [01:00:52]. Obedience and humility are seen as crucial for the church to maintain its spiritual authority and influence [01:15:00]. When God's people humble themselves and repent, God promises to "heal your land" [01:14:59], preventing negative spiritual forces from prevailing [01:15:52].

This perspective suggests that the church should focus on prayer and spiritual integrity rather than engaging in political arguments or societal conflicts that can diminish its authority [01:15:59]. Respect for constituted authority, regardless of personal agreement, is also stressed, drawing parallels to biblical principles [01:23:45]. The speaker shares a personal anecdote of divine intervention when he disregarded his wife's warning (an authority figure in the home) and almost suffered an accident, only for God to intervene after his wife "handed him over to God" [01:28:44]. This reinforces the belief in the power of prayer and respecting divinely appointed authorities.

The modern church faces a choice: engage in [[debates_on_modern_societal_values_vs_religious_teachings | societal debates]] or focus on the transformative power of Jesus' love, recognizing that the latter is more effective in reaching people [01:16:47]. The battle is seen not as between humans but against spiritual forces [01:17:30], where the church acts as "resistance" against the spirit of antichrist [01:18:10]. The ongoing presence of the Holy Spirit within believers provides the necessary power to overcome these challenges until the rapture [01:19:01].

## The Evolution of Religious Practices

The discussion also touches upon evolving practices within Protestantism, such as the acceptance of women pastors and the role of spiritual gifts.

### Women Pastors
The view on women serving as pastors is debated, with some arguing that cultural interpretations of biblical texts have historically limited women's roles [02:47:08]. However, drawing from principles of God's character and other biblical examples (like Deborah leading Israel), it is argued that God grants spiritual gifts regardless of gender [02:49:46]. The argument is made that if God appoints women to lead nations, they can certainly be pastors [02:50:55]. This progressive view asserts that Christianity, particularly the Gospel, promotes equality between men and women, gradually transforming societal norms [02:46:02].

### Spiritual Gifts
The role of spiritual gifts, such as speaking in tongues, also differs among Christian denominations. While some "cessationist" groups believe these gifts ceased with the apostles [01:48:14], others, particularly Pentecostal and Neo-Pentecostal churches, believe they are still active and accessible to all believers [01:50:45]. Speaking in tongues is understood as a personal edification tool, allowing believers to pray in the Spirit when they don't know how to pray otherwise [01:56:11]. The use of such gifts in public settings, however, is advised to be done with "parsimony" and order, ensuring they contribute to the community's edification rather than causing confusion [01:55:01].

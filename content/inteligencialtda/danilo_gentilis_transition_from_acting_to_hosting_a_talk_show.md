## Danilo Gentili's Transition to Talk Show Hosting

[[Danilo Gentilis standup comedy career and challenges | Danilo Gentili]] harbored a long-standing desire to host a talk show, a format he envisioned even while working as a reporter at CQC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>, and later as a guest on other programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>.

### Early Career and Talk Show Ambition
[[Danilo Gentilis standup comedy career and challenges | Danilo Gentili]] describes himself as never being "comfortable" in his roles, indicating a constant drive to create new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a>. His career began with a temporary contract at CQC, where he was the only reporter without a fixed position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>. He initially felt "uncomfortable" but used this feeling to create comedic "gags" for his "inexperienced reporter" segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>. This unique approach garnered success, leading to other countries like Portugal and Argentina attempting to replicate his style, even consulting him on his methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:03">[04:16:03]</a>.

Despite his success as a reporter, [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] always aimed for a talk show. He states he had been thinking about this project since 2008, understanding that his time as a reporter would eventually end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. He envisioned a talk show where he would bring together comedians he admired, specifically mentioning Murilo Couto, Léo Lins, and Rogério Morgado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. He even drew up potential scenery for his show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

### Launching "Agora é Tarde" at Band
His opportunity came when he conditioned his contract renewal at Band for CQC on being allowed to produce a pilot for his talk show, "Agora é Tarde" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>. Despite Band's initial skepticism, doubting a talk show could succeed outside of Globo due to perceived lack of structure and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:22]</a>, they agreed to two pilot episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

The first pilot aired during the World Cup, achieving an unexpected 4.0 rating, a significant jump from the usual 0.3 in that timeslot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>. The second pilot performed even better, reaching 4.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. This immediate success led Band to transform "Agora é Tarde" into a daily program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

However, the production at Band was challenging. [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] describes working with a "super lean team" under "bad conditions," including issues like lack of toilet paper and water for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. He even mentions drawing out plans in a notebook when things failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. He characterized this period as "pure stress," often fighting for basic production necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>.

### Move to SBT and "The Noite"
By the end of 2013, after nearly three years at Band, [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] was "stressed" and "swollen" from the immense workload and constant struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>. SBT began to "probe" him, expressing interest in bringing him over to revive their "Free Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

[[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] agreed to move only if he could bring his entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>. He held a meeting with his cast at the end of 2013, admitting his insecurity about leaving a successful show at Band for SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>. Two key team members, drummer Bacalhau and Marcelo "Mestre" Marrom, pressured him to make the switch, arguing for a bigger audience and better structure at SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

Band, upon learning of his potential departure, made a counter-offer of R$ 500,000 to keep him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>. However, [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] states that "money doesn't guide me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>, and he prioritized his team's collective decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. Despite [[challenges and controversies faced by Pnico na TV | Rafinha Bastos's]] anger and public criticism of his move to the theater and later to SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>, [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] maintained his decision.

The new program at SBT debuted strongly, achieving a 6.0 rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:19">[01:43:19]</a>, quickly establishing itself as a significant player in the late-night slot. [[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] attributes his success to his team and his commitment to his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:07">[02:33:07]</a>. He sees his work as a talk show host as a continuous process of self-improvement and loyalty to his comedic roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

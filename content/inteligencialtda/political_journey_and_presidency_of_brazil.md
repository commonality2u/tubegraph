This article details the political career and presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, drawing from his interview where he discusses his early life, military service, and political trajectory, including key policies and challenges faced during his term.

## Early Life and Background
Jair Bolsonaro was born in 1955 and grew up in Novo Ribeirão, near Eldorado Paulista, Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:47">[07:42:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:46">[07:43:46]</a>. He attended public school, which he described as "very good" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:71">[07:51:71]</a>. He was one of seven siblings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:35">[08:12:35]</a>. His father was a "practical dentist" and a prosthetic dentist, making dentures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:47">[10:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:07">[10:27:07]</a>. Bolsonaro states his family did not experience significant needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:47">[10:41:47]</a>. His childhood involved playing in the street, building carts, and flying kites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:73">[09:23:73]</a>. He also fished three days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:46">[10:02:46]</a> and worked as a newspaper delivery boy using his bicycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:46">[27:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:35">[27:10:35]</a>.

He noted that television was not common during his youth, with radio being the primary medium for entertainment and news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:04">[08:59:04]</a>. He also recalled creating crossword puzzles that were published in *Jornal Estado de São Paulo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:46">[19:10:46]</a>, and delivering newspapers, where he would highlight his published puzzles to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:85">[21:16:85]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:43">[21:29:43]</a>.

## Military Career
At 15, Bolsonaro developed an interest in the army after seeing uniformed military personnel in his city in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:23">[12:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:33">[12:12:33]</a>. He was the first in his family to join the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:36">[12:04:36]</a>. He passed the entrance exam for military schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:19">[11:54:19]</a> and served a total of 15 years in the Brazilian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:49">[12:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:98">[26:45:98]</a>. He was an athlete, participating in basketball, football, military pentathlon, and long-distance running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:01">[13:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:80">[13:17:80]</a>.

His military career provided a clear path to becoming a Colonel, which is "practically guaranteed" after graduating from the academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:16">[13:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. Only a few reach the rank of General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:42">[13:57:42]</a>. He recalled a significant experience on the border in Mato Grosso do Sul, where he was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:62">[17:19:62]</a>. Due to an electricity course he had taken, he became the head of the plant there, repairing diesel engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:29">[18:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:65">[18:34:65]</a>.

## Entry into Politics
Bolsonaro's entry into politics was "unintentional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:62">[17:19:62]</a>. It began in 1986 when he wrote an article for *Veja* magazine, which led to a disciplinary transgression because active military personnel are not allowed to make press declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:32">[25:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:02">[25:40:02]</a>. This incident brought him public attention and sparked his interest in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:05">[25:55:05]</a>.

He ran for city councilor in 1988 with the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:19">[26:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:37">[26:07:37]</a>. He was the most voted candidate in his party, which secured two councilor seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:14">[26:27:14]</a>. Two years later, he ran for federal deputy and served seven consecutive terms, totaling 28 years in that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:91">[26:34:91]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:88">[26:41:88]</a>. Including his time as a councilor, his political career spanned 30 years before becoming president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:75">[26:42:75]</a>.

During his time as a federal deputy, especially after 1991, he found the political environment to be heavily biased against the military. He encountered many amnestied ex-guerrillas in the Chamber of Deputies who viewed him, a captain, as "fresh meat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:78">[27:51:78]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:85">[28:02:85]</a>. He served as a "counterpoint" to the dominant left-wing narrative in Parliament, leading to numerous lawsuits against him for his speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:06">[28:50:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:19">[28:54:19]</a>. He criticized what he called the "Commission of Lies" (referring to the Truth Commission), stating it was ideologically driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:06">[29:36:06]</a>.

## Presidency
Bolsonaro's presidential campaign began after Dilma Rousseff's re-election in 2014, when he decided it was no longer "comfortable" to remain a federal deputy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:08">[30:59:08]</a>. He started traveling Brazil, talking to people, and identifying problems and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:28">[31:10:28]</a>. By 2016, more people were waiting for him at airports, and by 2018, thousands gathered for his rallies, though he claims the press largely ignored his growing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:22">[31:59:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:61">[32:18:61]</a>.

His rise coincided with public dissatisfaction that fueled movements like the MBL (Free Brazil Movement) and the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:17">[32:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:91">[32:40:91]</a>. He supported the impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:24">[32:51:24]</a>.

His election in 2018 was unexpected by many, including his own family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:08">[12:43:08]</a>. He ran with a campaign budget of R$2.4 million and only 7 seconds of television time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:32:00">[45:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:36:26">[45:36:26]</a>.

### Cabinet and Governance
Upon taking office in 2019, he sought to create a "technical ministry" rather than appointing based on [[Brazils_political_alliances | political alliances]] or bargaining, a practice he states was common in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:40">[40:54:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:97">[41:51:97]</a>. He cites Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas (Infrastructure Minister) and Marcos Pontes (Science and Technology Minister) as examples of technical appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:46">[40:56:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:95">[42:07:95]</a>. He believes this approach allows for better allocation of resources to critical areas like highways and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:54:48">[45:54:48]</a>.

He reduced the number of ministries from 39 to 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:56:06">[46:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:23">[47:00:23]</a>. He identified "absurd expenses" within the government machine, citing a R$50 million contract for teaching Indigenous people how to use Bitcoin through FUNAI, and expensive "facade consultancies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20:94">[47:20:94]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:04:46">[48:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:30">[48:15:30]</a>.

### Economic Policies
His administration focused on reducing bureaucracy and regulatory standards, particularly through the Economic Freedom Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:37">[49:37:37]</a>. This law reduced approval times for small businesses and lessened the burden of regulatory inspections on companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:06:58">[50:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:48">[50:57:48]</a>. He mentioned that the number of regulatory standards was reduced by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:48">[50:57:48]</a>.

On fuel prices, he stated that the reduction was achieved through tax cuts, specifically zeroing federal taxes and passing a project in the Chamber to reduce state ICMS taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:46:17">[56:46:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:01:46">[58:01:46]</a>. He contrasted this with past governments that artificially lowered prices at refineries, leading to accumulated losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:44">[58:28:44]</a>.

Regarding public servants, he stated that his government did not open many new positions due to a "swollen machine" but focused on essentials like federal police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:53:13">[51:53:13]</a>. He also announced a real increase in the minimum wage and for public servants for the coming year, after 3 years without adjustment due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:31:07">[52:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:25">[52:37:25]</a>.

### Social Policies and Controversies
Bolsonaro emphasizes his commitment to conservative values, including the defense of the family and opposition to drug legalization and "gender ideology" in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:36">[35:58:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:22">[36:28:22]</a>. He clarified that he is not homophobic and supports gay marriage, stating "everyone has the right to suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:26">[36:41:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:02">[36:48:02]</a>.

He strongly criticized [[political_corruption_in_brazil | corruption]] under the PT government, citing billions in diverted funds from pension funds and uncompleted refinery projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:98">[37:10:98]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:23">[38:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:47">[57:11:47]</a>. He claimed the PT and its allies "put their hand in everywhere" except the central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:95">[37:21:95]</a>.

### COVID-19 Response
He described the pandemic as the most difficult moment of his life and presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:40">[33:31:40]</a>. His government declared a state of emergency in early February 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:23">[02:04:23]</a>. He opposed restrictive measures like lockdowns, advocating for the isolation of the elderly and those with health problems while allowing others to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. He pointed out the negative effects of lockdowns, such as increased depression and suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

Bolsonaro stated that Brazil did not have access to vaccines in 2020 because no country had them for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. He also raised concerns about vaccine contracts that absolved manufacturers of responsibility for side effects and criticized the idea of vaccine passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. He asserted that Cuba bought all COVID-19 vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

### Relations with Other Figures and Institutions
Bolsonaro noted that his government invited all political figures to participate in interviews, including [[lula_and_the_brazilian_political_landscape | Lula]], Ciro Gomes, Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, Ricardo Salles, Fernando Haddad, Marina Silva, and Rodrigo Garcia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He described his relationship with Sérgio Moro, his former Justice Minister, as having "differences" but being "perfectly tuned and aligned" in the common goal of opposing [[lula_and_the_brazilian_political_landscape | Lula]]'s return to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:42">[02:13:42]</a>.

He discussed the "secret budget," a parliamentary amendment created in his second year of government (2020), which he claims he vetoed but Congress overturned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:47">[01:33:47]</a>. He stated that this budget is not truly secret as it's published, but the names of the parliamentarians who propose the allocations are not public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. He denies using it to "buy votes" from the opposition, citing 13 PT deputies who received funds but never voted with his government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.

### Media Relations and "Fake News"
Bolsonaro believes that major media outlets have lost credibility by taking [[Brazils_political_alliances | political sides]] and spreading "fake news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>. He stated that his administration "garroted advertising expenses" from state-owned companies to the press, which contributed to negative coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. He called censorship by the Supreme Federal Court (STF) and Superior Electoral Court (TSE) "dangerous," arguing that the public should be able to differentiate between truth and lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>.

### Scandals and Allegations
Bolsonaro addressed several personal allegations, including those related to his family's property purchases using cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. He clarified that "currency current" in property deeds does not necessarily mean cash, and that his family members, including a brother-in-law with 30 construction and furniture stores, were capable of making such purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:24">[01:47:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. He also defended his wife's corporate card expenses as normal family spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:59">[01:42:59]</a>.

He commented on the "cannibal" controversy, stating it stemmed from an incident over 30 years ago in an Indigenous reserve where a ritual involved cooking and eating a deceased tribal member, which he observed as part of their tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:54">[02:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:04">[02:17:04]</a>.

He also clarified the "chick climate" comment, explaining it was about a gathering of Venezuelan girls preparing for an event, where he noticed a "climate" of needing help, implying they were in a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:27">[02:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:43">[02:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:40">[02:15:40]</a>.

### Agriculture and Infrastructure
Bolsonaro emphasized Brazil's agricultural strength, noting that the country now exports food, a shift from importing it in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:05">[02:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>. He highlighted the policy of titling land for over 420,000 "posseiros" (squatters), which grants them legal ownership, access to financing, and reduces land invasions by groups like the MST (Landless Workers' Movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>.

He discussed new energy initiatives, including offshore wind power in the Northeast and the resumption of construction of Angra 3 nuclear plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:48">[02:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:39">[02:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:18">[02:55:18]</a>. He also mentioned increasing fish production in Lake Itaipu and incentivizing fish farming by eliminating federal taxes on fish feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a>.

On infrastructure, he pointed to concessions for airports and ports, and highway improvements, such as the Dutra highway contract which reduced tolls by 20% and zeroed them for motorcycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>.

### Self-Correction and Future Outlook
Bolsonaro stated that he engages in daily "self-criticism" and uses social media comments to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. He admitted that some of his past words have caused "indignation" and "rejection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. He acknowledged changing his views over time, specifically from being a "statist" and opposing privatizations to recognizing that a "bloated state does not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:39">[01:57:39]</a>.

He appealed to voters to cast their ballots, whether for him or his opponent, rather than abstaining or voting null <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:02">[02:45:02]</a>. He believes that non-voting leads to a president governing without a clear mandate from the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:56">[02:46:56]</a>. He argues that the opposition uses "fake news" and labels against him, such as accusations of racism, homophobia, or disliking Northeasterners, which he denies with personal examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:56">[02:47:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:09">[02:48:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:15">[02:48:15]</a>.

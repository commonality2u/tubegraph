## [[emerson_cears_journey_from_northeast_brazil_to_comedy_success | Emerson Ceará's Journey to Comedy Success]]

Emerson Ceará, originally from Northeast Brazil, moved to Curitiba to pursue a career in comedy and found success, eventually appearing on shows like Faustão [00:00:03]. He views himself as intelligent, particularly in certain subjects [00:00:41]. His journey began with performing theater in school, often hidden from his father who was illiterate and did not approve [01:18:18]. He even tested for a movie role, but his father's refusal to authorize his participation prevented him from being selected [01:37:37].

Emerson's move to Curitiba in 2006 was due to being "fooled" into thinking Londrina was in Ceará [02:22:09]. He initially went to Londrina for a peddler job, which paid R$360, a significant amount at the time [02:31:51]. After realizing Londrina was in Paraná, he eventually made his way to Curitiba for a job in a sales team [02:22:18]. He attributes his life's achievements to "lying to survive," such as pretending to have experience as a waiter to get a job at a pizzeria [02:39:35].

> When Emerson arrived in Curitiba, he initially sold basic food baskets with a sales team [02:47:04]. He described his living situation as sharing a house with eight other people, some of whom had committed serious crimes [02:59:16]. He learned to cook, do laundry, and even clean for his housemates to gain their friendship and avoid conflict [02:59:16].

## Entry into Comedy and Early Struggles

Emerson's first interaction with the comedy scene was through a friend, Ramos Neto, whom he met at the pizzeria [03:04:31]. Ramos Neto was opening a comedy bar and invited Emerson to work there [03:13:58]. Emerson initially applied as a waiter, but lied and claimed to know how to be a bartender to secure the job [03:59:00]. He quickly learned classic drinks by looking them up online at a LAN house, having no computer or internet at home [03:07:07].

His first comedy performance was at a mic night with only 15 people in the audience, and he recalls it as "horrible" [04:50:31]. His early jokes, like one about a cat, had nothing to do with his life, which was a critical piece of feedback he later received [04:50:31].

### [[challenges_of_standup_comedy | Challenges of Standup Comedy]]

Emerson's journey highlights many [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | challenges]] in the comedy industry:

*   **Learning the Craft:** Early performances were "horrible" [04:50:31]. He received crucial advice to stop using general jokes and instead focus on telling stories from his own life, which would inherently be funny due to his unique background [05:21:40].
*   **Lack of Support and Cliques:** Emerson frequently encountered a lack of support and felt excluded by established comedians. He describes a prevalent "pot" mentality where some comedians form cliques and do not help newcomers [01:11:12]. He recounts instances where he was not invited to perform with certain groups or at festivals, even when he believed he was qualified [01:00:40].
    *   One particularly embarrassing moment was a competition where he had to perform after a "master" comedian, resulting in a poor set [00:49:30]. He was upset not because he didn't win, but because his performance was genuinely bad [01:06:07].
    *   He also noted that some senior comedians would get annoyed if a waiter, like himself, performed better than them [00:57:57].
*   **Financial Hardship:** In his early days, Emerson and other comedians faced extreme poverty, sometimes only eating tea and popcorn [02:00:56]. They would attend other comedians' shows primarily to get free food [02:02:00].
*   **Dealing with Criticism:** He faced criticism for using too much profanity in his acts, with some people refusing to book him for shows because of it [00:58:14]. This made him feel that he was doing something wrong financially [00:58:33].
*   **Ego and Jealousy:** Emerson observed significant ego issues among comedians, especially when a less established comedian, like a waiter, performed well [01:06:07]. He felt that some established comedians would actively try to prevent others from succeeding [01:06:07].
*   **Logistical Difficulties:** Touring involved long bus trips and often performing in less-than-ideal venues, like school bathrooms used as changing rooms [01:42:59]. He also recounts a harrowing experience of being guided by a faulty GPS on a dirt road in Santa Catarina at 2 AM, leading to a confrontation with police [02:01:22].

## Evolution and Success

Despite the challenges, Emerson persisted. He learned to incorporate his personal stories and observations into his acts, realizing that his life itself was material [00:52:19]. A turning point came when a friend suggested he stop talking about "loose stuff" and instead focus on his unique journey from the Northeast to Curitiba [05:21:40].

> [!tip] Audience Connection
> A mentor advised Emerson not to start his show with a joke but to talk to the audience first, making them feel as if he was entering their home [03:16:00]. This approach, he states, changed his life and improved his connection with the crowd [03:18:49].

He started posting videos online, eventually generating significant views on Facebook and YouTube [01:11:40]. This online presence was crucial for his career, bringing him attention and bookings [01:16:12]. A 50,000 R$ loan from a friend, intended for online promotion, helped boost his reach, allowing him to pay it back within four months [01:17:09]. His internet presence eventually led to television appearances, including on Faustão [01:10:05].

Emerson's career trajectory shows a shift in the comedy landscape, where internet presence became as important as traditional stage time, allowing artists from outside major centers like São Paulo to achieve success [01:09:30]. He believes his consistent career is proof that one doesn't necessarily have to move to São Paulo to succeed [01:09:41].

### [[comedy_scenes_in_various_brazilian_cities | Comedy Scenes in Various Brazilian Cities]]

Emerson's experiences touch upon several [[comedy_scenes_in_various_brazilian_cities | comedy scenes]] in Brazil:

*   **Curitiba:** Described as a difficult place to perform due to its audience and the prevalence of cliques [01:03:33]. Venues mentioned include Curitiba Comedy [01:19:33], Brahma Bar [01:04:47], and Santa Comedy [01:03:57]. He notes that Curitiba audiences often prefer a more conversational approach rather than immediate jokes [03:16:00].
*   **São Paulo:** Mentioned as a major hub, though Emerson notes that success isn't exclusively tied to being there [01:09:30].
*   **Rio de Janeiro:** Referenced as a place where he performed [00:41:00].
*   **Northeast Brazil:** His origin, noted for having a different style of humor, often more character-based rather than pure standup [01:32:51].
*   **Interior of Paraná/Santa Catarina:** Places where he toured, often in less formal venues [01:13:00].

He also discusses the changing nature of comedy, where older comedians like Ary Toledo and Golias were the references, but now younger comedians often imitate online personalities or celebrities [01:32:51]. He emphasizes the importance of unique stories and staying true to one's own voice [00:52:19].

## Personal Anecdotes and Philosophical Reflections

Emerson shares many personal stories, some explicit, demonstrating how his life experiences fuel his comedy. These include:

*   His early days sleeping in motels and dealing with glass bathrooms [02:44:00].
*   A bizarre incident where his car broke down 300 meters from a motel he was going to with his girlfriend, and his brother-in-law, a tow truck driver, arrived to help [04:22:56].
*   His former marriage to an older woman whom he met while working as a sales team member in Curitiba [02:59:16].
*   His initial struggles as a bartender, learning classic cocktails from Google at a LAN house, and accidentally setting a buffet on fire [03:31:00].
*   A chaotic show where he was heavily drunk on vodka and started "embarrassing" couples in the front row, leading to apologies later [01:32:00].
*   Adventures at a "swing" house (swinger club) where he performed comedy [01:50:19].

He reflects on the transient nature of life, the importance of seizing opportunities, and the virtue of honesty, despite his early reliance on "lying to survive" [02:39:35]. He also speaks on the concept of "faith" and believing in oneself to take risks in a career path [01:53:00]. When asked about the lowest point in his career, he mentions being homeless and hungry in Curitiba, contemplating giving up and returning home, but was encouraged by a friend not to quit [02:25:12]. This period, though difficult, ultimately led to his success [02:27:56].

Host Rog√©rio Guilherme introduces a program focusing on spiritual topics, often featuring pastors, priests, and rabbis, to discuss the spiritual aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Spiritual Growth and Ministry Expansion
Pastor Lamartine shares how his ministry experienced significant growth during the pandemic. When churches closed, he turned to online platforms, initially not knowing how to conduct live streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. His YouTube channel expanded from 40,000 subscribers to 1.5 million over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This period of challenge became an opportunity, as God "opened the door" for him to reach people he otherwise couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

His church membership grew from 4,000 to 12,000 within two years, a growth he attributes directly to the pandemic and his YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He recounts how God spoke to him in a dream, telling him he would be the "Pastor of these people" who followed him online and that he should change the church's name to reflect this new, broader ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Despite initial resistance, he presented the idea to his congregation, who approved the name change with 100% consensus, viewing it as a divine leading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This highlights a [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | personal and supernatural experience related to faith]] and a [[transformation_and_conversion_experience | transformation in his ministry]].

He notes that the internet serves as a powerful tool for spreading the gospel globally, allowing him to reach over 20 nations in Europe through online "cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This digital outreach meant he had more people watching his sermons online than attending in-person services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## The Nature of Spiritual Authority and Obedience
Lamartine emphasizes that God's heart is moved by repentance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. He believes that for a nation to be healed and for the enemy's influence to be curtailed, God's people must seek Him and repent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. He advocates for prayer and calling out to God for the best for Brazil, rather than engaging in political arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

He highlights the power of obedience to God-established authority, stating that rebellion is akin to witchcraft, and can lead to a curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. He gives a personal anecdote from his rebellious youth where his wife's prayer to God about his reckless driving led to a direct, humbling encounter with the police, which he saw as divine intervention to curb his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. This deeply impacted his understanding of submission to authority, even unjust ones, because God can intervene where humans cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. This reflects [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | overcoming personal challenges and transformation]].

## Personal Conversion and Transformation
Lamartine shares his own [[transformation_and_conversion_experience | conversion experience]] at age 19. Previously a rebellious youth from an Italian Catholic family, he constantly fought and smoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>. He attended a Christian camp with the theme "Apocalypse Now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. Despite bringing whiskey and cigarettes, he was deeply moved by a song and gave his life to Christ that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. He prayed for deliverance from his smoking addiction, and immediately lost the desire to smoke, even with cigarettes readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. This was a direct [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | personal and supernatural experience related to faith]].

His [[personal_transformation_and_redemption_journey | personal transformation and redemption journey]] extended to his relationship with his father. After his conversion, he immediately sought out his father, whom he had previously threatened and defied, to ask for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. Eight months later, his father, a lifelong Catholic, also accepted Jesus, expressing that Lamartine's real-life change convinced him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. Lamartine later had the privilege of baptizing his father, serving as a good son for 19 years until his father's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:55">[01:41:55]</a>. This illustrates the profound [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality_in_personal_growth | role of religion and spirituality in personal growth]].

## The Enduring Nature of God's Love
Lamartine concludes by reflecting on God's unwavering love:
> "Nothing you do, good, will make God love you one millimeter more, and nothing you do, evil, will make God love you one millimeter less because of God's love for you; it is perfect and complete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:40">[03:01:40]</a>.

He emphasizes that his faith is not born of fear, but a relationship of love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He encourages listeners to seek out and discover the love of Jesus, as it changed his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:22">[03:02:22]</a>. This encapsulates his [[spirituality_and_personal_beliefs | spirituality and personal beliefs]].

## Additional Insights on Faith and Doctrine

### Gifts of the Holy Spirit
Lamartine believes in the continued operation of spiritual gifts, such as speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing. He states that the Holy Spirit acts through believers today, and these gifts are accessible to anyone who believes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:45">[01:50:45]</a>. He clarifies that speaking in tongues can have two manifestations: speaking foreign languages or speaking a language of angels, both serving the purpose of individual edification and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>. He also acknowledges the diversity of beliefs among Christian denominations regarding these gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>.

### Women in Ministry
Regarding women serving as pastors, Lamartine asserts that a woman can be a pastor, interpreting biblical passages often used against this view as having cultural contexts of their time (e.g., women lacking education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:01">[02:47:01]</a>. He points out that God gives gifts to individuals regardless of gender, citing examples like Deborah who led Israel in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>. He sees machismo as a consequence of the Fall and believes Christianity redeems women, placing them as equals to men, rather than being responsible for sexism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.

### The Problem of Evil and Free Will
Addressing the question of why God allows evil or creates beings knowing they might fall, Lamartine emphasizes the concept of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. True love, he argues, requires freedom of choice; if God forced obedience, it would not be genuine love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. God, being omniscient, knows what will be, but still allows beings to choose, valuing a love relationship over enforced compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. This connects to [[modern_challenges_to_faith_and_spiritual_integrity | modern challenges to faith and spiritual integrity]] as it addresses complex theological questions.

### Hell and Annihilationism
Lamartine states his personal struggle with the concept of eternal hell, finding it difficult to reconcile with a loving God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:12">[02:57:12]</a>. Despite this, he believes in hell because Jesus spoke of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:30">[02:57:30]</a>. He mentions that some denominations, like Adventists, are annihilationists, believing that the unsaved suffer for a time and then cease to exist, rather than enduring conscious eternal torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:38">[03:00:38]</a>.

### Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit
He explains that "blasphemy against the Holy Spirit" is a definitive, conscious rejection of Jesus by someone who has been enlightened and tasted God's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:22">[02:11:22]</a>. It's not a moral sin, but a complete abandonment of faith, which is considered impossible to renew for repentance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>. He reassures listeners that if they are concerned they have committed this sin, the very act of worrying indicates they have not truly rejected God's Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:36">[02:11:36]</a>.

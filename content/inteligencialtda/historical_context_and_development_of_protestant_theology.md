From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

Protestant theology, particularly concerning salvation, is often debated between two major schools of thought: Calvinism and Arminianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. While not the only existing positions, these two are the most prominent in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. It is important to note that these two aspects are not inherently enemies or mutually exclusive, despite some tendencies to attack each other rigorously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. [[historical_development_and_variations_in_christianity | Christianity]] unites believers as brothers and sisters in faith, not adherence to one of these doctrinal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Both perspectives are considered orthodox and not heretical, and both acknowledge the Bible as the inerrant and infallible word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Origins and Key Figures

### Jacob Arminius and the Synod of Dort

Arminianism emerged from within Calvinism, initiated by Jacob Arminius, who died in 1609 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Arminius, a director at the University of Leiden in Holland, initially a Calvinist, began to question the more rigorous aspects of predestination and election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This shift in Calvinism in the 10th (likely 16th/17th) century, known as Protestant Scholasticism, placed extreme emphasis on the doctrine of election, which was not as pronounced in John Calvin's earlier writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Arminius's followers presented a document outlining their disagreements with Calvinism in 1610, leading to the Synod of Dort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

The Synod of Dort, held from 1618 to 1619 in the Netherlands, established the "five points of Calvinism," often abbreviated as TULIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This synod declared these points as the orthodox soteriology for the Dutch church, barring those who disagreed from pastoral ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Arminians were initially banned but returned after the death of the Calvinist leader Maurice of Nassau, promoting religious freedom and other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This led to Arminianism developing more outside the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### The TULIP Acronym

The five points of Calvinist soteriology defined by the Synod of Dort are:
*   **T**otal Depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   **U**nconditional Election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   **L**imited Atonement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   **I**rresistible Grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   **P**erseverance of the Saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>

## Key Doctrinal Differences

### Predestination and Election

Both Calvinism and Arminianism acknowledge the biblical concept of election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. However, they differ in *how* this election is carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Calvinism**: Emphasizes that God chose individuals for eternal life before the foundation of the world, not based on foreseen human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This election is seen as unconditional and by grace, meaning God chose without any prior merit or foreseen good in the person (Ephesians 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. All who believe in Christ are considered elect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Arminianism**: Believes that God's election is based on His foreknowledge of who would believe and persevere in faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This implies a fixed number of saved individuals, similar to Calvinism's logical outcome regarding limited atonement, even if Arminians do not explicitly admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Biblical references cited for election include Acts 13:48, Revelation 17:8, Matthew 24, Romans 8, and Ephesians 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Atonement: Limited vs. Unlimited

This is a core point of disagreement:
*   **Arminianism**: Believes Jesus Christ died for *all* people, making salvation available to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The death of Christ is an honest and effective offering to all, and those who believe are saved (Titus 2:11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Biblical texts like Romans 11:32, Hebrews 2:9, and 1 John 2:2 are cited to support the idea that Christ tasted death for "every man" or "the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Calvinism (Dortian)**: Believes Christ died to "buy" His chosen ones, meaning His atonement is limited in its *design* to the elect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. While some Calvinists (e.g., Amyraldians) propose "hypothetical universalism" (Christ died for all so that if someone believes, they can be saved), the Synod of Dort's Calvinism states Christ died specifically for His chosen ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This view interprets terms like "all" in biblical texts (e.g., Romans 11:32) to mean "Jews and Gentiles" (i.e., all categories of people), not necessarily every individual human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Divine Sovereignty vs. Human Responsibility

Both systems grapple with the relationship between God's sovereignty and human freedom.
*   **Calvinism**: Affirms that God determines all things (Divine Sovereignty), yet humans remain fully responsible for their actions (Human Responsibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This creates an "insoluble theological tension" or paradox within Calvinist thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. For example, God can harden hearts (Deuteronomy 29:4, Isaiah 6:9-10, Exodus 19, 1 Samuel 2:25) while holding individuals accountable for their disobedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Similarly, God decreed the death of Jesus and Judas's betrayal, yet Judas was still held responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This tension is not denied but accepted as beyond human comprehension (Romans 9:19-20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Arminianism**: While acknowledging God's sovereignty, places greater emphasis on human free will and the ability to accept or reject God's grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. It posits that God, being omniscient, knows the future because He *foresees* it, not because He *decrees* every event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This view argues that for a final judgment to be meaningful, humans must have genuine freedom to choose their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. It emphasizes texts showing that God invites all and that individuals choose to respond (e.g., Cain's choice in Genesis 4:6-7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

### Love of God vs. Wrath of God

*   **Arminianism**: Stresses that God loves all human beings unconditionally, viewing anger not as an antonym of love but as an emotion compatible with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. God's offer of salvation through Jesus is genuine for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Calvinism**: Accepts that "God is love" (1 John 4:8) and His love is infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. However, it also acknowledges God's infinite wrath and justice, which harmonize in His inscrutable mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Texts like Proverbs 16:4 (God made the wicked for the day of calamity) and Romans 9 (God prepares vessels of wrath for destruction) are cited as evidence that God's love does not negate His sovereign choice to create some for judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Free Will and Grace

*   **Calvinism**: The concept of "free will" is nuanced. For Calvinists, true "free will" (freedom from corrupting influence) was lost in Eden after the Fall, as humanity's will became tainted by sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Thus, no one can come to Jesus unless the Father draws them (John 6:44) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. God's "irresistible grace" influences the elect to believe, opening their hearts without coercing their will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. While God's decree encompasses all events, human responsibility to choose and act within that sphere remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Arminianism**: Acknowledges that the Holy Spirit opens hearts and that salvation is a work of God (monergistic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. However, it emphasizes that God calls humans to *participate* synergistically in the process of salvation, meaning people can accept or reject God's grace (2 Corinthians 6:1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This includes "prevenient grace" which prepares individuals to receive the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Exegesis and Theological Interpretation

The approaches to interpreting biblical texts play a significant role in these debates.
*   **Calvinist exegesis**: Emphasizes rigorous textual study and adherence to the original author's intent, using grammatical and historical contextual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. John Calvin is described as an unparalleled exegete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Arminian exegesis**: While not denying biblical authority, Arminius's exegesis is described as less rigorous, sometimes resorting to allegorical interpretations when facing difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The historical context of Protestant Scholasticism, with its focus on logic over exegesis, is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The debate between Calvinism and Arminianism, particularly regarding salvation and God's interaction with human will, highlights profound theological tensions within [[church_history_and_theological_discussions | Christian theology]]. While Calvinists embrace these tensions as an acknowledgment of God's inscrutable mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, Arminians seek to reconcile divine attributes in a way that emphasizes human freedom and responsibility. Both traditions agree on the necessity of God's grace for salvation, but differ on the extent and mechanism of its application and human response.

The Josias puppet was created out of a need for new characters on the show *Pânico* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Conception and Development
The initial idea for the character came from Morgado and Beth Moreno, a writer for the show, who were looking for a new character for Igor Guimarães to portray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. Igor was already performing other characters at the time, including the lawyer Paloma and Indian Ana Jones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

Igor suggested creating a doll character. Beth Moreno then provided a doll for him to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Igor stated that he didn't even need makeup for the role, effectively becoming the doll himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The name "Josias" was proposed by Marcelo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

## Character Traits and Impact
The Josias puppet gained significant popularity, becoming a hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. Igor believes its success stemmed from its mix of "bread with the wrong" – combining conventional humor with heavier, more absurd topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.

The character's humor often touched on themes like prison voices, cancer, train incidents, and organ theft, which Igor considered "absurd" and "pretty heavy" for a puppet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. This unique blend of light and dark humor resonated with a younger audience that was gravitating towards lighter comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. The Josias puppet became a prominent part of *Pânico*, which at the time was looking to regain its distinct comedic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

Igor has a themed room dedicated to the Josias doll in his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. He would also interact with the doll during his solo shows, making it sing songs and interact with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

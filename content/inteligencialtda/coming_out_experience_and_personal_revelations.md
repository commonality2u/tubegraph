Igor Guimarães made a "great revelation" on the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This personal revelation involved his sexual orientation. He shared this with his closest friends before announcing it publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

Initially, he was nervous to speak about it on stage, but he found it a historic moment for himself and for comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a>. He mentioned that if the audience didn't enjoy it, it wouldn't matter, as he felt he was doing something necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>.

### The Revelation
Igor stated that for him, he knew he was gay and that it was a truth, not a doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. This revelation happened during a difficult week for him, particularly around Father's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>. He felt he was deceiving people by not sharing his truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>. As he became more mature and aware, he felt he was boycotting himself by not speaking about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>. He believed his coming out wouldn't cause a bigger impact or negative repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>. For him, it was about getting rid of something that bothered him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>.

The comedian explained that his proximity to Emílio and the show *Pânico* made him feel comfortable to make the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. He also joked that living with his friend Arianna Nutt made him "turn gay," implying her influence on his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. This revelation was an important step in his [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | personal transformation and redemption journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>.

### Impact and Activism
Igor believes that simply doing his work and expressing his art in the way he wants is a major form of activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. He views coexistence as the best form of activism, where people can admire each other's work and become more accepting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. His approach helped "open the mind" for aspiring comedians, showing that they can do anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>.

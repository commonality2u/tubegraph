From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The concept of [[end_times_theology_discussion | end times]] and [[biblical_prophecies_and_their_fulfillment | biblical prophecies]] is a central theme in Christian theology, involving events such as the [[tribulation_and_biblical_prophecy | Great Tribulation]], the Rapture, and the Second Coming of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Many revelations are discussed in relation to these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Spiritual Warfare

A continuous "spiritual war" is believed to be ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. This battle is not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil in heavenly regions, including principalities and powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:04">[05:10:04]</a>.

### Satan and His Plan
Satan's plan is to take as many souls as possible, aiming to disrupt God's plan of redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. He is described as the "prince of the power of the air" or "prince of potestad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>, residing in the "second heaven" (the firmament we see) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. God resides in the "third heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>.

*   **Knowledge and Deception**
    Satan is powerful and intelligent, but not omniscient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. He knew of the Messiah's coming through [[biblical_prophecies_and_their_fulfillment | prophecy]] in Genesis 3:15, which speaks of a descendant hurting his heel but crushing the serpent's head, interpreted as the cross and Satan's ultimate defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. He attempts to destroy those who could be the Messiah, as seen in his attempts to kill Moses and Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.
    [!INFO] Satan's ultimate plan is to hurt God by hurting those God loves, aiming to destroy humanity, but he is destined to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:15">[02:12:15]</a>.
*   **Loss of Position, Not Power**
    After the fall, Satan lost his position as an anointed Cherub, the most powerful creature in heaven, who was the leader of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>. He did not lose his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. He managed to convince a third of the angels to follow him, who are now demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:38">[01:53:38]</a>.
*   **Satan's Hope**
    Despite knowing biblical [[biblical_prophecies_and_their_fulfillment | prophecy]] stating he will lose, Satan might believe he can win, a "conjecture" due to powerful deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>. His followers, like Satanists and Illuminati, also believe they will win, not truly believing the Bible's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>.

### Angels and Demons
The Bible speaks of "thousands upon thousands" or "myriads" of angels, potentially billions, outnumbering people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:25">[02:18:25]</a>. The number of fallen angels (demons) is fixed, as no more angels were deceived after the initial fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>.

*   **Hierarchy**
    There is a hierarchy among angels and demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. Archangels and principalities are theoretically on the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>. Satan is considered more powerful than Michael the Archangel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>.
    *   **Archangel Michael**: Fights for the people of Israel and is considered the main general of the armies of the Most High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:45">[03:09:45]</a>.
    *   **Cherubim and Seraphim**: Powerful celestial beings who attend God's throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
    *   **Principalities**: Control specific nations or regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>.
    *   **Powers**: Act in specific areas, such as media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>.
*   **Manifestation**
    Angels, when manifesting physically, often appear as men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>. The "Angel of the Lord" in the Old Testament, who receives worship, is interpreted as a "christophany" or "theophany" â€“ a manifestation of Christ before his incarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. Regular angels refuse worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

### Signs of Spiritual Battle
Signs of spiritual battle can include:
*   Invasive thoughts (e.g., worthlessness, suicidal thoughts, unbelief in God, feeling crazy, simulation theory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:11">[03:51:11]</a>.
*   Absurd discouragement or sadness, potentially linked to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:52">[03:55:52]</a>.
*   External misfortunes, where "everything goes wrong" (e.g., car breaking down, stolen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:31">[03:56:31]</a>.
*   Increased temptation in one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>.
*   Difficulty praying, feeling weight, tiredness, or falling asleep while trying to pray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>.

### Weapons in Spiritual Warfare
The Bible describes a "whole armor of God" as spiritual weapons:
*   **Belt of Truth**: Like a Roman utility belt, holding everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:01">[05:53:01]</a>.
*   **Breastplate of Righteousness**: Protects against spiritual attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:13">[05:53:13]</a>.
*   **Shoes with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace**: Allow one to navigate difficult terrains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:29">[05:53:29]</a>.
*   **Shield of Faith**: Erases "inflamed data of the evil one" (like flaming arrows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:40">[05:53:40]</a>.
*   **Helmet of Salvation**: Protects the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:58">[05:54:58]</a>.
*   **Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God**: The only offensive weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:26">[05:56:26]</a>. Declaring God's word counters negative feelings and attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:41">[05:56:41]</a>.

Other practical tools include prayer, fasting, and seeking help from trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:12">[05:12:12]</a>. [[understanding_biblical_teachings | Understanding biblical teachings]] like forgiveness is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:55">[06:09:55]</a>. Forgiveness is not about the person who deserves it, but about oneself and God's forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:43">[06:07:43]</a>.

## Israel and End Times Prophecy
Israel is seen as "God's Clock" in [[biblical_prophecies_and_their_fulfillment | biblical prophecy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>.
*   **Return to the Land**: Ezekiel 36-38 prophesies the return of the scattered people of Israel from all nations to their land, fulfilled by the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>. This contrasts with previous exiles (e.g., Babylonian exile) where they were not scattered among *all* nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>.
*   **Gog and Magog War**: Ezekiel 38-39 describes Gog (a leader) from the land of Magog, leading various nations (including Persia/Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Russia from the extreme north) to invade Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>. This invasion will ultimately fail, leading nations to know God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>. Some theologians debate if this war is the same as the Battle of Armageddon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:55">[02:02:55]</a>.
*   **Euphrates River Drying**: The Euphrates River is drying due to dams, which is significant as it is prophesied that armies from the East will cross this dried river to march against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

## Key Figures and Events in End Times

### The Antichrist and Demonic Trinity
The "demonic trinity" consists of Satan (opposing God), the Antichrist (in Christ's place), and the False Prophet (in the Holy Spirit's place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.
*   **Antichrist's Role**: The Antichrist will position himself as the true Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a>. He will perform miraculous powers, as Satan has the power to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.
*   **False Prophet's Role**: The False Prophet will convince the world that the Antichrist is the true Christ, similar to how the Holy Spirit convinces people that Jesus is God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. He will also perform miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.
*   **Peace Agreement**: The Antichrist will reveal himself after an apostasy (cooling of faith) and will make a 7-year peace agreement between Israel and many nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:12">[02:29:12]</a>. This agreement will allow the construction of the Third Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:44">[02:32:44]</a>.
*   **Break with Israel**: In the second half of his 7-year reign, the Antichrist will enter the Holy of Holies in the rebuilt Temple, declaring himself God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:30">[02:43:30]</a>. This act will cause Israel to break with him, initiating persecution and the [[tribulation_and_biblical_prophecy | Great Tribulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>.
*   **One World Religion**: The Antichrist will create a new syncretic religion where everything is permitted, provided he is worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:36">[02:44:36]</a>.

### Mark of the Beast
The mark of the beast (666) is believed to be a subcutaneous introduction of a nano-robot or chip with artificial intelligence, placed on the hand or forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>. The Greek word "charagma" (mark) implies a mark made with an object that hurts the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>. The internet ("WWW") is seen as the system that will allow the introduction and control enabled by this chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:36">[02:58:36]</a>.

### Two Witnesses and 144,000
*   **144,000 Chosen**: These are 12,000 young, chaste Jews from each tribe of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>. They will preach the Gospel globally, primarily to the Jewish people, proving Jesus is the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:24">[02:48:24]</a>.
*   **Two Witnesses**: Two prophets who will preach for three and a half years during the [[tribulation_and_biblical_prophecy | first half of the tribulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:43">[02:47:43]</a>. They will possess supernatural powers, like closing the sky from rain or turning water into blood, similar to Elijah and Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>. They will be killed by the Antichrist and resurrected after three days, visible globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:21">[02:51:21]</a>. Their appearance will lead many in Israel to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:08">[02:52:08]</a>.

### Rapture and Second Coming of Jesus
There are different [[interpretations_of_prophecy_and_future_tribulation | interpretations of prophecy and future tribulation]] regarding the rapture and the second coming.
*   **Rapture (First Step)**: Jesus comes for believers in the air, a "secret rapture" where no one will see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. The church is taken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:17">[02:20:17]</a>.
*   **Second Coming (Second Step)**: Occurs after the 7-year [[tribulation_and_biblical_prophecy | tribulation]], when Israel is surrounded by enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:39">[02:29:39]</a>. A sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavens, and all nations will see and mourn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:16">[02:30:16]</a>. Jesus descends on a white horse with millions of angels and saints, coming to judge and end the Antichrist's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:25">[02:30:25]</a>. This leads to the Millennium, a literal 1,000-year reign of peace on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:15">[02:36:15]</a>.

## Role of Technology
Technological advancement is accelerating, with significant jumps in AI and 5G, enabling widespread control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Multiplication**: Daniel prophesies that in the last days, "knowledge will multiply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. The explosion of knowledge in the last 150 years (e.g., steam engine, car, plane, internet) allows for global control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>.
*   **Global Control**: Digital money, interconnected data, and recognition technologies (e.g., at airports) remove privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>. Chips and neuralink technology offer convenience (e.g., health monitoring, direct internet connection) but also the potential for control over human bodies and minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:59">[02:06:59]</a>.
*   **Globalism vs. Sovereignty**: There's a growing push for globalism, with politicians arguing against national sovereignty, which is seen as preparing the way for the Antichrist's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:54">[02:50:54]</a>.

## Interpretations of Prophecy
*   **Day as a Period**: The Hebrew word "yom" (day) in Genesis can represent a 24-hour period or a longer period of time, opening the possibility for millions of years of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Gap Theory**: Proposes a gap between Genesis 1:1 ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth") and Genesis 1:3 (God begins to "make" creation from a chaotic state). This gap may explain the age of the Earth and a cataclysmic event, possibly Lucifer's battle against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:36">[02:39:36]</a>.
*   **Theistic Evolution**: The belief that God created the world but used evolution as a method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. This differs from traditional Darwinian evolution, which lacks hybrid fossils proving inter-species transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:43">[02:42:43]</a>.
*   **Three Days of Darkness Prophecy**: A prophecy by an unnamed woman predicting three full days of global darkness is considered false, as natural eclipses can only last a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:29">[02:11:29]</a>.
*   **Great Reset**: A proposal by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum to "reset" the world with 17 specific items, including people owning nothing and being happy, and a shift to "clean energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:25">[02:12:25]</a>. This is linked to the UN 2030 agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:26">[02:13:26]</a>. It is seen as a preparation for the Antichrist's government, potentially including a single world currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:40">[02:13:40]</a>. Resistance from countries like Russia and China is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>.

## Christian Life in the End Times
The Christian's faith is paramount in navigating these [[end_times_theology_discussion | end times]].
*   **Salvation by Faith**: Salvation is by grace through faith, a gift from God, not by works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:28">[02:08:28]</a>. However, good works are a consequence and evidence of true conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>.
*   **God's Love**: God's love for humanity is emphasized, willing to sacrifice Jesus for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Even in the midst of spiritual warfare and personal struggles, God's love provides the strength to endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.
*   **Importance of Confession and Prayer**: Confessing sins, asking for forgiveness, filling oneself with God's word, and prayer are vital for closing "gaps" that demons might exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:15">[03:01:15]</a>.
*   **Forgiveness**: Forgiveness is a supernatural act that frees the one who forgives, not necessarily the one who receives it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:37">[03:07:37]</a>.

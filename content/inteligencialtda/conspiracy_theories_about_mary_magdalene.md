Mary Magdalene has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, primarily centered around her relationship with Jesus and her historical suppression by the Church. These theories often suggest a hidden lineage of Jesus or a deliberate attempt to diminish women's roles in early Christianity.

## Claim of Marriage to Jesus and Hidden Lineage

A prominent conspiracy theory posits that [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] was not only Jesus' wife but also bore his children, leading to a hidden lineage that the Church sought to suppress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:49">[02:06:49]</a>. This idea gained significant traction with Dan Brown's book *The Da Vinci Code*, which suggested a lineage continuing in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:02">[02:11:02]</a>. However, there is no historical proof to support this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>. The Bible, if she were his wife, would have no reason to omit it, as marriage was not seen as a hindrance in Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>.

### The Last Supper Painting Interpretation

Dan Brown's *The Da Vinci Code* also popularised an interpretation of Leonardo da Vinci's *The Last Supper* painting. The theory suggests that the figure traditionally identified as John the Apostle, seated next to Jesus, is actually [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] due to perceived feminine features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:14">[02:15:14]</a>. Additionally, the painting is interpreted to show Peter holding a knife, suggesting he wanted to "liquidate" Mary, and the formation of 'V' and 'M' shapes (for Virgin Mary, or possibly "Magdalene") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>. However, it's noted that Renaissance artists commonly depicted young men with feminine features, which is not an indication of gender in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:56">[02:16:56]</a>.

### Forged Ancient Texts

In the 21st century, a fragment of an ancient Coptic gospel was presented, claiming to prove that Jesus was married to [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a>. This document was initially embraced by some academics, particularly those with a strong feminist agenda who sought to find evidence of [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]]'s importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:33">[02:00:33]</a>. However, technical analysis later revealed it to be a 20th-century forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

## Theories of Church Suppression

Conspiracy theories also suggest that the Church actively suppressed [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]]'s true role and status. It is theorized that the growing power of her name within the early Church threatened the patriarchy, leading to her being inaccurately portrayed as a prostitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.

### Pope Gregory I and the Prostitute Narrative

The idea that [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] was a prostitute was largely created by Pope Gregory the Great in 591 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He reportedly conflated her with the "sinful woman" mentioned in Luke 7:36 and the adulterous woman in John 8:1-11, neither of whom are identified as prostitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. The term "sinner" in the Bible at that time did not necessarily imply prostitution, but rather someone who had difficulties with gravity or was believed to have a secret sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Delayed Canonization

Another element fueling these theories is the significant delay in [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]]'s canonization within the Catholic Church, which only occurred under Pope Francis after two millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. This delay, compared to other saints, led to speculation of deliberate suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>.

## Gnostic Interpretations and Apocryphal Gospels

[[biblical_interpretations_and_gnostic_perspectives | Gnostic views on Mary Magdalene]] played a significant role in creating alternative narratives. The Gnostics sought to create a more mystical and palatable form of Christianity for the Greco-Roman world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. They claimed Jesus had secret teachings reserved for an elite few who possessed "gnosis" (knowledge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>.

They produced various [[biblical_interpretations_and_gnostic_perspectives | Apocryphal Gospels]], including the Gospel according to Mary Magdalene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. These texts emphasized the "sacred feminine" to appeal to pagan religions that praised goddesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. In these [[gnostic_views_on_mary_magdalene | Gnostic views]], [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] was not a physical wife but a "mystical companion," representing the "feminine wisdom of Sophia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>. She was seen as a vessel for the divine spirit, similar to how they believed the "spirit of Christ" entered and guided the man Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>. None of these [[gnostic_views_on_mary_magdalene | Gnostic gospels]], however, describe a "royal wedding" between Jesus and [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:21">[01:47:21]</a>. They focused on her role in receiving secret knowledge from Jesus, helping her "remember" her wise, uncontaminated spirit before being bound by matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>.

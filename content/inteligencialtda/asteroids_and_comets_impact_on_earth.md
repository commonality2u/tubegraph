Asteroids and comets have played a crucial role in the Earth's history, influencing everything from the presence of water to the origin and evolution of life. Scientific understanding of their impact has evolved significantly over time, with ongoing research continuing to refine our theories.

## Early Hypotheses on Earth's Water Origin

Initially, scientists believed that Earth's water primarily came from comets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>. Comets are essentially "ice balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>, forming tails (or "syrup") as their ice melts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>. These celestial bodies often display two distinct tails: one composed of less-melted ice particles and another, often blue, ion tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>.

In 1986, the European Space Agency's Giotto probe passed near Halley's Comet and initially reported that its water was similar to Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>. However, this data was later found to be incorrect due to equipment malfunction on the probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>. Giotto itself was named after an Italian artist who famously painted a comet (thought to be Halley's) above the birth of Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

A more recent mission, the Rosetta probe, visited Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014. While it found water, it was composed of heavy hydrogen (deuterium), which is not the same as Earth's water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

### Asteroids as Water Source

More recent studies of certain asteroid types have revealed water compositions similar to Earth's H2O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. Despite this, there are not enough asteroids to account for all the water present on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

### The "Wet Earth" Hypothesis

Today, the prevailing idea is that Earth's water came from a combination of sources: some from asteroids, some potentially from comets, and a significant portion from the Earth being "born wet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>. Particles of pre-solar dust, existing before the formation of the Sun, have been found to contain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

## Delivery of Life's Building Blocks

Beyond water, comets are known to be rich in fundamental building blocks of life, such as hydrocarbons and other chemical elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>. Similarly, asteroids have been found to contain complex organic compounds, including amino acids â€“ the building blocks of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:31">[03:36:31]</a>.

It is believed that early Earth underwent a "great bombardment" of these objects, which delivered these essential elements to the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:47">[03:33:47]</a>. Asteroids are particularly valuable for understanding this period, as they have remained largely unchanged for the past 4.5 billion years, offering a glimpse into the early solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:04">[03:54:04]</a>. Samples from asteroids like Bennu and Ryugu confirm the presence of these fundamental blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:04">[03:54:04]</a>.

While the concept of panspermia suggests that life itself arrived on Earth fully formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:42">[03:53:42]</a>, the more accepted theory is that only the fundamental building blocks arrived from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:04">[03:54:04]</a>, which then combined with Earth's unique conditions, such as hydrothermal vents, to form life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:42">[03:53:42]</a>.

## Impact Events and Mass Extinctions

The Earth's early history was characterized by a period of intense bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:47">[03:33:47]</a>. Evidence of this can be seen on the Moon, which is covered in millions of craters due to the absence of weathering and life to erase these marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>. Earth also experienced this bombardment, but its active geology, including plate tectonics and atmospheric processes, has erased most of the ancient impact craters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>.

One of the most well-known impact events is the asteroid collision 66 million years ago that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>. This event caused a decrease in global productivity, leading to the death of any animal weighing over 25 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>. This impact is believed to have occurred in spring, based on evidence from flowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This event, and other mass extinctions throughout Earth's history, typically caused by external processes like asteroid impacts or volcanism, ultimately led to significant climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>. It's the climate change that actually causes mass extinctions, as species cannot adapt quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>.

Each mass extinction event has inadvertently prepared the conditions for the emergence of a new type of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>.

## Moon Formation and Its Importance

The Moon itself is believed to have formed from a collision between Earth and another planet-sized object called Theia, approximately 4.5 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:40">[02:44:40]</a>. The impact ejected material from Earth's mantle, which then coalesced under gravity to form the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:40">[02:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:46">[02:52:46]</a>. Recent studies indicate that pieces of Theia might still be present within Earth's mantle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

This catastrophic event also drastically changed Earth's rotation, slowing its day from an initial 5-6 hours to the current 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:01">[02:45:01]</a>. The Moon continues to cause tidal friction, further slowing Earth's rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:12">[02:45:12]</a>.

The Moon is vital for maintaining the stable inclination of Earth's axis, which is currently at 23 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>. Without this stability, Earth would experience extreme seasonal variations, with half the planet facing continuous sun or darkness for long periods, making life much more difficult or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>. This emphasizes why a large moon is considered crucial for a planet to support complex life, in addition to plate tectonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>.

While the Moon has less water than Earth, it is present in several locations, particularly in craters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a>. Missions are now exploring ways to extract this water for potential use as rocket fuel in future space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:01">[03:56:01]</a>.

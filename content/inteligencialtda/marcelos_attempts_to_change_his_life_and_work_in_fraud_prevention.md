Marcelo, known for his past as a conman, has transitioned his life and now works in fraud prevention. His journey towards change was profoundly influenced by personal experiences, particularly becoming a parent, which instilled in him a new sense of fear and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

## A Decisive Change of Path

The pivotal moment for Marcelo to stop his criminal activities was when he decided to write his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32">[07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[07:34]</a>. His current wife, Ellen, played a crucial role in his transformation; she learned about his past through the press after his arrest in Rond√¥nia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Despite the deception, Ellen chose to stay with him, supporting his decision to serve his sentence and embrace a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. She remained by his side for five years during his incarceration, a testament to her commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

Marcelo acknowledges that his biggest challenge is a "constant fight against his own brain" to avoid reverting to old habits, as his psychiatrist once warned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. He now consciously applies his intelligence to lawful endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. His children are fully aware of his past and the consequences, and are guided towards making positive choices in their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

## Work in Fraud Prevention

Today, Marcelo works as a consultant and lecturer, specializing in combating fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. He teaches banks how to identify and prevent fraudulent activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. He recognizes that while technology has made fraud easier, it also provides tools for prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of staying "a step ahead" of scammers for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

Marcelo and Mariana Caltabiano have recently relaunched their book and established official social media channels, including Instagram and YouTube, under "Marcelo VIPS official" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. These platforms offer tips on how to avoid falling victim to scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

### Advice on Avoiding Scams

Marcelo's primary advice for avoiding scams is encapsulated in the adage: "When the alms are too much, the saint is suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. He cautions against offers that seem "free" or "too good to be true," as "it doesn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>. This practical lesson is drawn from his own experiences and observations of [[The risks of economic scams and investment fraud | economic scams and investment fraud]].

The **Elize Matsunaga case** involves the murder and dismemberment of Marcos Matsunaga, husband of [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]], a crime that garnered significant media attention in Brazil. The investigation was led by Delegate Mauro Dias, with journalist Ulisses Campbell later writing a book about the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Key Figures in the Investigation and Narrative

### Delegate Mauro Dias
Mauro Dias, known as Mauro Dias in the police, is a retired professional with 33 years of experience, two of which were spent teaching law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He served in police intelligence throughout his career, spending a significant portion in the homicide department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Dias was the lead delegate in the [[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations | Elize Matsunaga case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Ulisses Campbell
Ulisses Campbell is a journalist and writer who authored a book about [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]], part of a trilogy that also includes books on [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen]] and [[flordelis_case_and_its_implications | Flordelis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. His book on [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]], titled "Murderer and Manipulator," was delayed due to the ongoing legal processes, requiring him to rewrite parts to avoid directly calling her a murderer or mastermind before conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. He broadened the book's focus to include [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize's background]], family, and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Case Timeline and Initial Discovery
The case began with the discovery of a dismembered body in Cotia, SÃ£o Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Initially, the victim was unidentified, with only body parts and no head found, making identification difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The body was discovered after several days, meaning blood evidence had already dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Delegate Mauro Dias immediately noted the precision of the cuts, suggesting they were made by someone with knowledge of anatomy, such as a veterinarian, necropsy assistant, or butcher, indicating familiarity with cutting instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. He predicted that once the victim was identified, the killer would be found within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Investigation Process
Marcos Matsunaga was identified through missing person reports filed by his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. His brother initially went to the IML (Medical Legal Institute) in Cotia and recognized Marcos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Key Interviews
*   **Marcos's Brother**: Revealed Marcos was married and had children with two different women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He also mentioned [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] was a nurse and knew about wine, and that she was a surgical instrument nurse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **The Reverend**: The spiritual mentor of Marcos and [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]], who revealed [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] confessed marital problems and that he had warned Marcos that [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] might kill him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. He also described [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] as "unbalanced" and mentioned the couple owned dozens or hundreds of weapons, being professional shooters and hunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

### Evidence Collection
*   **CCTV Footage**: An investigator obtained 10 days of surveillance footage from the apartment building, showing Marcos leaving and [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] returning with three suitcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This footage became crucial evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Search and Seizure**: Based on [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga's]] background as a nurse and the Reverend's testimony, Delegate Mauro requested a search warrant and temporary arrest warrant for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The police collected clothing, boots, and a specific blue trash bag with a red ribbon, which was identical to the bags used to dispose of Marcos's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Elize's Interrogation and Confession
Delegate Mauro confronted [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] directly, asking her why she killed her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. After a moment of silence and static expression, she denied it, but her body language indicated guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

During the interrogation, [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] attempted to mislead investigators by claiming Marcos had a lover and ran away, even forging bank transfers to support this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. She also sent emails from Marcos's computer to his family to maintain the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

Eventually, [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] confessed to the crime, a decision possibly influenced by her lawyer, as confession is a mandatory cause for sentence reduction in Brazilian criminal legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. She detailed where she killed him, where she dragged the body, and where she started the dismemberment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. The investigation concluded she acted alone, countering the initial theory of an accomplice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>.

## Debate on Accomplice
The possibility of a second person assisting [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] in the dismemberment was raised, particularly due to forensic reports mentioning "diverse" cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. However, Mauro Dias argued against this, noting that Marcos's shirt was cut while on him, which would not happen if someone was assisting and could see the body fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. He explained that [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] removed Marcos's pants but not his shirt for dismemberment, a detail only known by the investigator who found the shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He also highlighted [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga's]] prior experience as a hunter and her knowledge of handling cutting instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The theory of a second person also included the idea that a woman might lack the physical strength to dismember a 90kg body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. However, the police reconstructed the crime scene and confirmed that [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] could have performed the dismemberment and moved the body alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

## Evidence and Forensic Aspects
*   **Crime Scene Investigation**: The apartment was "impeccable" with no visual signs of the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The search focused on uncovering hidden evidence.
*   **Weapons**: The apartment contained dozens, if not hundreds, of weapons, as both Marcos and [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize]] were professional shooters and hunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Weapons were hidden in strategic places, including a shotgun behind clothes and a secret room that was once a bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Ballistics**: [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] demonstrated knowledge of ballistics by changing the barrel of the gun and disposing of the bullet casing in the toilet to prevent ballistics testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>.
*   **Cell Tower Data**: Police obtained cell phone records, which, combined with cell tower analysis (azimuth direction), placed [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] at the exact location on Estrada dos Pires in Cotia where the body was dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. This was a crucial piece of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
*   **Luminol**: Luminol testing was requested to detect blood traces in the apartment, although its application was delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

## Trial and Sentence
The [[legal_nuances_in_high_profile_crime_convictions | trial]] of [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] was affected by media attention. Ulisses Campbell observed that judges are often more comfortable rendering sentences alone rather than in a jury court, where public and media pressure can be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. The Nardoni case was cited as an example of public pressure influencing a jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. [[Overview of Suzane von Richthofen case | Suzane von Richthofen's]] sentence, for example, was broadcast live on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

[[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga's]] trial occurred during the same week as the Chapecoense plane crash, which shifted public attention away from her case, potentially allowing for a less influenced verdict by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:18">[01:51:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:25">[01:51:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>. Her confession played a role in reducing her sentence, which was seen by some as "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. In Brazil, penalties can be significantly reduced due to legal benefits, leading to earlier release, as seen in cases like [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:09">[01:53:09]</a>.

## Post-Conviction Developments / Consequences
*   **Inheritance Dispute**: [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] lost her rights to the apartment and the valuable wine cellar (originally worth 900,000 reais, but she received 450,000 for her share) due to the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:47">[02:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:27">[02:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:31">[02:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:40">[02:09:40]</a>.
*   **Property Sale**: The armored TR4 car used to transport the body was put up for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. Some of Marcos's weapons were also sold at auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:19">[02:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:22">[02:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>.
*   **Daughter's Custody**: The couple's daughter is with Marcos's maternal grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:36">[03:13:36]</a>. There is an ongoing legal dispute to remove [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga's]] name from the girl's birth certificate, which is considered a controversial measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:09">[03:14:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:13">[03:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:15">[03:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:18">[03:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:23">[03:14:23]</a>.

## Reflections on the Case
The case is often described as a [[true_crime_case_studies | true crime case study]], attracting public interest in human psychology and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:15">[02:21:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. [[Elize Matsunaga and her background | Elize Matsunaga's]] personality is described as cynical, and her actions in comforting the family while concealing the murder were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>.

### Resocialization
The discussion around [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] also touches upon the concept of resocialization. Mauro Dias distinguishes between "professional criminals" (like robbers or drug dealers) and "criminals of passion" (like [[elize_matsunaga_and_her_background | Elize Matsunaga]] or [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen]]), believing that the latter group has a higher potential for resocialization due to their crimes being rooted in relationship dynamics rather than a criminal career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:38">[03:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:42">[03:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:45">[03:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:47">[03:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:51">[03:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:18">[03:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:22">[03:14:22]</a>.

Whindersson Nunes began his comedy career online in the early 2000s, around 2001, coinciding with his first access to a computer [01:07:07-01:21:26]. He discovered online content like "Cannibal World," which featured many videos, and would watch about 15 videos at dawn [02:00:00-02:15:00].

## Early Online Content and YouTube

He participated in YouTube groups where creators would like and share each other's videos to help channels grow [02:50:00-03:01:00]. He even created an end-of-year special, requesting videos from everyone in the group, which he also contributed to [03:32:00-03:40:00].

His YouTube channel was started in 2013, but it was hacked and deleted [03:36:00-03:43:00]. At the time, he had around 35,000 subscribers, a significant number when few creators had millions [04:48:00-04:54:00]. After the hacking, he was encouraged to restart, and with campaigns from other YouTubers like Milho Wonka and Lilo, he quickly regained his previous subscriber count, reaching 40,000 [04:08:00-04:42:00].

Initially, he wasn't focused on monetization, only later realizing the financial potential [04:51:00-05:00:00]. When he first earned around R$600, it was a turning point, confirming that hard work could lead to more earnings [04:47:00-04:58:00].

## Transition to Stand-Up Comedy

His first stand-up show in São Paulo was for only 14 people at a bar [03:45:00-03:51:00]. He found it difficult to make them laugh because they were likely there to be critical [04:05:00-04:12:00].

Nunes describes his entry into stand-up as natural [04:38:00-04:39:00]. Friends encouraged him, seeing his potential from his videos [04:56:00-04:59:00]. While he wasn't nervous for his very first show, subsequent performances brought nervousness, leading him to hold the microphone with both hands to hide shaking [05:02:00-05:18:00]. Over time, he learned to control his nervousness by focusing on one person in the audience [06:42:00-06:46:00].

His comedy style evolved from performing caricatures, which was what he learned early on, to a more conversational and storytelling approach [01:06:51-01:07:16]. He prefers to share his personal stories and experiences [01:05:50-01:06:05].

## Influences and Inspirations

Growing up without television in a remote area of Piauí, his early exposure to entertainment was through radio [01:13:52-01:14:16]. This led him to create his own narratives, like imagining a rivalry between Felipe Dylon, Michael Jackson, and Pepe Moreno based on how often their songs played [01:14:21-01:14:32]. This period also fostered his creativity and curiosity, as he explored books on geography, chemistry, and math, and even comics like "Turma da Mônica" [01:11:32-01:14:48].

He later found inspiration in early Brazilian stand-up comedians like Paulo Vieira, Patrick Maia, [[Danilo Gentilis standup comedy career and challenges | Danilo Gentili]], and Rafinha Bastos, whose performances he saw through early cable TV packages [04:39:00-04:59:00]. He also followed local comedians from Piauí like Dirceu Andrade and Amauri Jucá [04:28:00-04:34:00].

## Touring and Challenges

Nunes has toured extensively, performing in many countries, including Japan and the United States, where he once drew 2,500 people in New York [07:18:00-07:44:00]. He notes that doing shows outside Brazil can be a "lottery," as audience sizes can vary significantly [07:18:00-07:52:00]. He has performed in at least 20 countries since 2017 [08:04:00-08:10:00].

He adapts his shows to different audiences; for example, shows in the interior of Brazil or the Northeast tend to be longer, sometimes exceeding two hours [01:35:02-01:35:12].

## Personal and Professional Growth

Nunes experienced a difficult period in the previous year, close to depression, due to changes in his routine and financial uncertainty [02:11:16-02:11:34]. He emphasized the importance of seeking professional help for mental health issues, viewing depression as a treatable illness [02:12:03-02:12:05]. He sought therapy, which helped him regain well-being [02:12:40-02:12:42].

He believes his ability to cope with criticism has contributed to his growth [02:27:06-02:27:08]. He advises aspiring creators not to be afraid of facing problems or criticism, and to pursue their dreams, even if their initial work seems "bad" or "shameful" [02:15:08-02:16:03].

## Future Projects and Philosophy

He is involved in several film projects, including a horror film about a doll named Euclides and a historical film about the Battle of Jenipapo, which will blend drama with comedy [01:35:38-01:36:09].

He is also developing an animated series titled "My Dog Regina," which tells the story of a street dog adopted by a celebrity, showing the world from the dog's perspective [02:27:07-02:30:14].

Nunes defines an artist as someone who finds solutions and "workarounds" to problems [05:44:00-05:59:00]. He believes that everyone is unique and should not simply copy others, but instead learn from different experiences to forge their own path [01:57:04-01:57:07].

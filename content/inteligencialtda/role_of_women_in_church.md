The role of women in the church, as well as broader societal issues like machismo and feminism, are topics of ongoing discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Machismo and the Fall
Machismo is seen as a consequence of the biblical fall of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:26">[02:44:26]</a>. When man sinned, a curse was placed upon him, stating that he would earn his bread by the sweat of his brow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:32">[02:44:32]</a> and that the land would produce thorns and weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:45">[02:44:45]</a>. For women, God said, "your desire will be for your husband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:55">[02:44:55]</a> and associated pain with childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:06">[02:45:06]</a>. This perspective suggests that God never intended women to be subjugated by men; rather, it was a consequence of the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.

Historically, women have often held an inferior position in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:18">[02:45:18]</a>. While some ancient societies, like certain Greek cultures or Pygmies, might have had women in prevalent roles, the vast majority were under judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:31">[02:45:31]</a>. Christianity is viewed as gradually easing this societal machismo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:56">[02:45:56]</a>.

## Jesus' View on Women
Jesus demonstrated a very special love for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>. In His time, the testimony of a woman was valued at half that of a man, meaning it took two women's testimonies to equal one man's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:07">[02:46:07]</a>. Despite this, Jesus first revealed His resurrection to [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:14">[02:46:14]</a>, sending her to tell others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:18">[02:46:18]</a>. Jesus treated women as equals to men, and Christianity is believed to redeem women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:31">[02:46:31]</a>. The church is not considered responsible for machismo, but rather society's machismo influences people within the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:40">[02:46:40]</a>.

## Women as Pastors
The belief that a woman can be a pastor is based on interpreting the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:01">[02:47:01]</a>.
A common argument against women teaching in church, found in Pauline texts, is understood as a cultural response to the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:08">[02:47:08]</a>. Women generally lacked access to education, often not knowing how to read or write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:14">[02:47:14]</a>. When Paul advises women to ask their husbands at home instead of speaking in church, it's also explained by the practice of dividing men and women during services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:21">[02:47:21]</a>. If a woman didn't understand something, she would ask her husband at home, as she wouldn't have had access to the Bible or formal teaching methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:39">[02:47:39]</a>.

The Bible's approach to certain cultural issues, like slavery, is seen as a gradual transformation rather than an outright ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:52">[02:47:52]</a>. God freed His people from Egyptians, but the New Testament letters don't explicitly command slave owners to free their slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:57">[02:48:57]</a>. Similarly, polygamy was common in biblical times, but by Jesus' time, the norm was one man and one woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:21">[02:48:21]</a>. The Gospel and God's word are believed to gradually transform society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>.

### God's Principle and Women in Authority
God is seen as against slavery because the Gospel brings freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>. This principle applies to women in leadership:
- God gives gifts to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:46">[02:49:46]</a>. Many women possess spiritual gifts in greater measure than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:48">[02:49:48]</a>.
- If God establishes a woman to lead an entire nation, like Angela Merkel or Margaret Thatcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:48">[02:50:48]</a>, it logically follows that a woman can be a pastor of a small church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>. This highlights a cultural rather than a divine impediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>.
- Deborah, one of the judges in the Bible, led the people and even commanded military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>. If God gives anointing, talent, and gifts to a woman, restricting her role is cultural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:23">[02:51:23]</a>.
- God made woman as a helper *next to* man, not *behind* him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:43">[02:51:43]</a>. While machismo is considered wrong, feminism, despite its extraordinary advances, still has areas to conquer, such as equal pay for equal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. However, Christianity fundamentally advocates for equality between men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:16">[02:52:16]</a>.

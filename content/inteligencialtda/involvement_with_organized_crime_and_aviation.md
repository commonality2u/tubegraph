Marcelo VIPS, known for his life of adventures, pursued a childhood dream of becoming a pilot. His mother worked at the Ministry of Aeronautics at the air base in Curitiba, and he lived practically in front of an aeroclub, where he developed his passion for aviation by watching planes and making friends with those involved in instruction flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. He studied normally, then pursued a pilot's course under a false name while a fugitive, already possessing the necessary knowledge to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Cartel Pilotry and Operations
Marcelo's involvement as a pilot for a cartel began around 2012, and he became a professional by 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. He operated primarily from Pedro Juan Caballero in Paraguay, where he met individuals involved in [[drug_trafficking_in_airports | contraband]] flights and started flying cases himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. "Samba" was the term used for crossing the border from Paraguay into Brazil with various contraband items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

As a cartel pilot, Marcelo diversified his operations, using different runways and varying flight schedules, making him indispensable to the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. He obtained a proper pilot course in Paraguay under a false name, later pursuing specialization in Rio Grande do Sul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

### Kamikaze Flights
Marcelo described "Kamikaze flights" as the most dangerous operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. These involved flying for many hours over the jungle, requiring precise fuel calculations to reach remote, unmarked runways without error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. Pilots relied on satellite phone calls from a contact named "Uncle Iridium" to know the precise moment to cross the border, avoiding US radar planes that would refuel and change crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. Landing was guided by ground crews who lit oil barrels along the airstrip when the pilot was about to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Delays could be fatal, as returning was not an option if the lights weren't activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Marcelo admitted to losing friends this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

Marcelo flew twin-engine planes and, if caught, would drop the cargo to lighten the plane and ensure his escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. He spent about 16 years as a pilot for the cartel, though his operations were interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. He was never arrested during this time, only recaptured on land due to prior warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

### Deceiving US Narcotics Force
Marcelo successfully fooled the US narcotics force. He planted a rumor in Colombia that his organization would buy a fighter jet to shoot down a US helicopter monitoring the airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This tactic instilled fear in other pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. He then offered to fly his own jet, a black-painted Saiteichon jet with altered turbines to create a loud noise, over the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. The idea was to make the US forces believe it was the fictional fighter jet, causing them to stay on the ground out of fear. This plan worked, allowing other planes to cross the border safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. As a result, Marcelo's name is on a watch list, preventing him from entering the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>. This incident is considered by Marcelo to be a story that should be part of a series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

## Exiting the Criminal Life
Marcelo's fear of getting arrested was minimal because he always knew how to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. He considered getting arrested the "natural consequence" of his actions, always having an escape plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. He also had the support of the cartel, which considered him indispensable due to his unique operational skills and financial contributions, ensuring they would assist in his release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. His "two specialties" were rebellion and escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

Marcelo learned to be afraid only after having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. The most difficult part of his life was deciding to stop and change his life, as continuing was "very easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. He actively fights against his past impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. He decided to serve his sentence and live a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. Today, Marcelo works with lectures and consulting, focusing on combating fraud for banks and other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. He also provides sales consultation lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. Marcelo has official social media channels to offer tips on avoiding scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. His children are aware of his past and the consequences of choosing the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

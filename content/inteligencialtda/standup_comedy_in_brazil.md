Standup comedy in Brazil emerged in the mid-2200s, with Danilo Gentili noting the presence of "first stand up groups in Brazil" around 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> and 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:46">[02:09:46]</a>. The early scene was characterized by a collaborative spirit among a small group of pioneers.

## Early Days and Pioneers

The beginnings of Brazilian standup comedy were largely informal, with comedians learning and developing their craft without established precedents. Danilo Gentili recalls discovering standup after seeing Jerry Lewis perform in a suit and tie, telling stories to make people laugh, which was different from traditional jokes by comedians like Costinha or Ary Toledo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>.

The internet played a crucial role in connecting aspiring comedians. Danilo Gentili, having access to the internet only after midnight due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>, found standup comedy through online research. He joined an Orkut community dedicated to standup comedy created by Henrique Pantarotto, where he began exchanging ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

Key figures in the nascent standup scene included:
*   Marcela Leal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>
*   Rafinha Bastos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>
*   Oscar Filho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>
*   Márcio Ribeiro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>
*   Diogo Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>
*   Bruno Motta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>
*   Robson Nunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>
*   Luiz França <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>

## Venues and Growth

The **Beverly Hills** venue was a significant starting point for many comedians, including those who formed the first groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Early performances were often short, around 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

Two prominent standup comedy groups emerged:
*   **Comedy Club**: This was an early collective featuring Marcela Leal, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Márcio Ribeiro, and Diogo Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:21">[03:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. They performed on Sundays and Mondays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Comédia Ao Vivo (Live Comedy)**: Created by Danilo Gentili, this group was formed out of a desire for more performance opportunities. Gentili approached Márcio Ribeiro, Robson Nunes, and Luiz França to join, also inviting "pepperoni" (Marcela Leal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. This show consistently drew crowds from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a> and had a famous wall background for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

The popularity of standup comedy significantly increased after comedians like Diogo Portugal appeared on major television shows like Faustão and Jô Soares, making the genre widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Danilo Gentili's own early material included observations about Silvio Santos's "Roda" (wheel) and McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Conflicts

[[challenges_of_standup_comedy | Challenges of standup comedy]] were present from the start. Comedians initially had no blueprint or mentorship, learning by trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>.

Internal conflicts and rivalries sometimes arose within the burgeoning scene:
*   **Club vs. Theater**: Rafinha Bastos was initially against moving standup performances from bars to theaters, believing the intimate setting of bars was essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. However, he later performed in theaters himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
*   **Exclusivity**: The Comedy Club had an agreement where new members required unanimous approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. Rafael (Rafinha Bastos) reportedly opposed Danilo Gentili joining the Comedy Club, leading Gentili to create Comédia Ao Vivo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Boycotts and Disloyalty**: Danilo Gentili recounts instances where he felt boycotted or treated disloyally by other comedians. One notable incident involved Rafinha Bastos becoming angry when Oscar Filho was late for a show due to a family friend's wake, and Rafinha was rude to Danilo who was covering for Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Later, when Portugal offered standup shows in Portugal, Rafinha allegedly told them not to call Danilo, claiming he didn't like standup or Portuguese accents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. Gentili also noted that those who became silent during the previous government's scrutiny of comedians were quick to criticize the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.

## Political and Social Commentary

[[impact_of_humor_in_brazilian_culture | Humor in Brazilian culture]] often intersects with politics. Danilo Gentili's politically incorrect standup show in 2010, performed in front of the National Congress in Brasília and streamed live by UOL, was a significant moment. He explicitly joked about political figures like Lula and Dilma, as well as others like Serra, Aécio, and Collor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>. This show, which became a trending topic on Twitter for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>, marked the beginning of public scrutiny and attempts to "cancel" him, turning his humor into perceived "offense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

Gentili describes this period as a time when critics began looking for "hair on the egg," decontextualizing jokes, and trying to find instances to "catch" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a>. He distinguishes between genuine criticism and politically motivated attacks, noting that while jokes might have a target, the intention is not to offend but to create laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:07">[01:58:07]</a>. He faced lawsuits and accusations of sexism for jokes, even when the context was misrepresented or fabricated by the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:36">[02:14:36]</a>. Gentili maintains that he always hit "everyone" in his jokes, not just one political side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>.

## Notable Events and Festivals

*   **Risorama**: A festival where Danilo Gentili performed jokes about politician Requião, eliciting a strong audience reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:45">[01:50:45]</a>.
*   **Risadaria**: A humor festival where Danilo Gentili's film, *How to Become the Worst Student in School*, won an award for Best Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

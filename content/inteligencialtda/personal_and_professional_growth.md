## Early Career and Digital Ventures

Pedro's professional journey began early, even before the widespread adoption of the internet. He started his first business in the 1990s as a "webmaster" when internet access was new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. His initial digital ventures included:
*   **Emulation Websites** He started by creating sites dedicated to game emulation, such as one for Atari games around 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. These early sites gained significant traction, with one becoming very popular and charging for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Ranking Websites** He developed a system called "ranking.com" that listed top websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This venture faced challenges when users began uploading inappropriate content, leading him to manually delete entries and eventually abandon the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Evangelical Dating Site** Pedro also created a successful evangelical dating website, which he humorously recalls led to many marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. This site involved creative strategies to populate it with user profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Guitar Chord Website** While working at General Electric, Pedro developed a website for guitar chords that could change tones and display fretboard diagrams in real-time, an innovative feature at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. This site, initially called "web.law," grew significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. He later acquired the domain "letras.com.br" for R$2,400 in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a> and later bought it back for R$100,000 in 2014 after losing it due to non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. This website became a significant financial success due to its direct access and high traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Expanding Business and Content Creation

As his online ventures grew, Pedro transitioned into broader business operations and content creation:
*   **Team Building** He began hiring employees to manage his websites, initially working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. His team expanded to include around 80 people, operating in multiple rooms and remotely during the pandemic, with a focus on employee well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.
*   **YouTube Transition** Recognizing the shift in online content consumption, Pedro decided to move from websites to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. He started a channel for guitar lessons, initially teaching rock music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. His first video taught "My Hero" by Foo Fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>.
*   **Nerd Content** Identifying a niche, he shifted to creating "nerd" content, providing illustrated videos with narration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>. This involved adapting successful formats from international channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. The channel, which started with low engagement, grew to over 2 million daily views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Personal and Professional Challenges

Pedro's journey was marked by significant [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_resilience | personal and professional challenges]]:
*   **Acceptance of Name** Early in his career, he learned to accept being called "Peter" instead of his actual name, "Pedro," due to how often it happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This is an early example of his [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | personal anecdotes and challenges]].
*   **Glaucoma** He revealed that he has glaucoma and has lost significant peripheral vision, which impacts his ability to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. He underwent surgery for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.
*   **Internet Controversies and "Cancellation"** Pedro has faced numerous controversies and "cancel culture" attempts due to his opinions on social media.
    *   He was summoned to a police station because a character name used on his channel (Darkside) was associated with Candomblé, leading to accusations of religious disrespect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. He explained that the character was a DC Comics villain threatening the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>.
    *   He faced backlash for a video where he commented on a perceived "harassment" incident, later regretting it after understanding the full context and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. He states he publicly apologized on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a> and believes people have the right to change their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.
    *   He defines "cancellation" as something that genuinely harms a person's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>, distinguishing it from online outrage.
    *   He believes that negative comments and attempts to "cancel" often attract more attention and can inadvertently bring more people to his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.
*   **Hacking Incidents** His YouTube channel and Twitter account have been hacked, causing him to lose access and content temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:40">[02:42:40]</a>. He also lost a database of all his customers due to a server issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:08">[02:49:08]</a>.
*   **Financial Growth** Pedro achieved his first million dollars at 23 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:47">[02:17:47]</a>. His financial success allowed him to overcome initial financial struggles and invest in his family's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>.

## Philosophy on Content and Life

Pedro's experiences have shaped his approach to content creation and his general outlook:
*   **Content Creator Identity** He defines himself as a "content creator," constantly thinking about how to improve his products and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:35">[02:33:35]</a>.
*   **Audience Engagement** He values direct feedback from his audience, seeing critical comments as opportunities for improvement rather than just negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Risk-Taking** He emphasizes the importance of adapting to new trends and taking risks, noting that he was never afraid to venture into new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:57">[03:21:57]</a>.
*   **Political Stance and Open Dialogue** Pedro avoids extreme political positions and believes in open dialogue, seeing himself as a "buffet" where he picks what he likes from both progressive and conservative viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. He tries to talk to people from all ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.
*   **Regret and Learning** He believes in the importance of acknowledging and regretting past mistakes, viewing it as a sign of growth rather than weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>.
*   **Legacy** He reflects on the idea of not truly dying as long as someone remembers your work, making entertainment a form of immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## Diverse Ventures

Beyond digital content, Pedro has explored various entrepreneurial endeavors:
*   **Musical Bands** He was a vocalist in two bands, "Resgate" and "Barbazul" (later "Sambazul"), playing gigs in Lapa and other venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

*   **Rental Company** He owned a rental company that included a self-service machine for printing homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:54">[02:28:54]</a>.
*   **Japanese Restaurant** He opened a Japanese restaurant in Petrópolis, despite having no prior experience in the food industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:27">[02:29:27]</a>. This venture faced challenges like staff issues and financial losses, leading to its closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:49">[02:30:49]</a>.

Pedro's narrative underscores a dynamic career marked by innovation, personal learning, and a willingness to face public and private challenges head-on, continually adapting and evolving in the process.

Cris Paiva recently underwent nose surgery, a procedure she had long contemplated but postponed due to other life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:50">[03:04:50]</a>. These priorities included her daughter's 15th birthday party and the need to replace furniture after a previous relationship ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. She decided to proceed with the surgery once things had settled down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:19">[03:05:19]</a>.

## Choosing the Surgeon and the Procedure
Cris chose Dr. Laerte, known for being highly skilled and recommended by her friends and wife Bruna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:27">[03:05:27]</a>. She prioritized the best surgeon over the cheapest option, emphasizing that trust in a good professional is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:01">[03:13:01]</a>.

During her first consultation, Dr. Laerte asked what bothered her about her appearance. She pointed to her nose, but he suggested there might be other issues she couldn't see due to her focus on the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:02">[03:08:02]</a>.

The surgery itself was comprehensive, including a rhinoplasty, an upper eyelid lift (due to naturally "chubby" eyelids since childhood), and a double chin procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:49">[03:08:49]</a>. All procedures were performed on the same day under one anesthesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:15">[03:12:15]</a>. The nose operation involved cutting both inside and outside to reshape it, narrowing its wide base and refining the rounded tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:55">[03:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>.

## Recovery and Results
Cris described the initial recovery as "agony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:37">[03:09:37]</a>. One month post-op, her nose was still significantly swollen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>. Full results for the nose are expected after four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. Despite the swelling, the healing process has been good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:31">[03:09:31]</a>. The eyelid scars are barely visible after 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:59">[03:11:59]</a>.

## Public and Personal Reaction
Cris has incorporated her surgery experience into her [[Standup comedy experiences and challenges | standup comedy]], making jokes about the "800 tons" removed from her nose and the 22,000 reais cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. She even joked that the surgery was done by "Odebrecht" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The comedy piece about her separation and transformation has been very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:57">[03:39:57]</a>.

Overall, Cris expresses immense gratitude for the positive changes in her life, viewing even difficult experiences as transformative. She believes her optimism and gratitude have brought blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:05">[03:33:05]</a>. The surgery is part of her larger personal [[Weight Loss Journey | transformation]] that began with emotional distress, leading to significant weight loss and a renewed sense of self-care and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>.

Terrorism, as a [[geopolitical_analysis_and_implications | political force]], is defined by its objective: to achieve political goals, such as destroying or recreating a state, or seeking autonomy [09:59:00]. This distinguishes it from common criminal organizations, which primarily seek economic gain [10:11:00]. The current conflict demonstrates that terrorism remains "alive and well," capable of producing "frightening damage" [10:23:00].

## Nature and Objectives of Terrorism
Terrorist organizations operate with a clear political agenda [09:56:00]. Unlike criminal groups like the PCC, which aims for economic activity, a terrorist organization seeks to destroy or recreate a state, or achieve autonomy [10:00:00]. This fundamental difference means their actions are aimed at achieving specific political outcomes through violent means [10:07:00].

### The Role of Surprise
A key element in military strategy, and particularly in terrorism, is surprise [26:46:00]. If an enemy is caught unprepared, their strategic capacity is eliminated, turning the conflict into a "mere and simple administrative driving of Steps by Steps" [27:26:00]. For years, Hamas understood it couldn't use obvious paths [27:52:00]. They focused on tunnels, which Israel had concentrated on detecting and destroying [28:07:00]. However, Hamas achieved a major surprise by attacking through the "front door" – breaching the border fence with paragliders and tractors, an act Israel considered "inconceivable" due to visible surveillance and security [29:16:00]. This move exploited Israel's expectation of indirect attacks, turning the expected into the unexpected [30:39:00].

### Psychological Warfare and Media Influence
Terrorist acts are designed to "create terror" [38:52:00]. The more terror generated, the more the organization believes it "wins" [39:09:00]. The graphic nature of the attacks, including filming atrocities like abused women, kidnapped children, and elderly people, serves to demonstrate their strength and capability [09:10:00]. This public display of brutality, despite clear evidence against the perpetrators, aims to elicit "passions" and "ideology," polarizing opinions rather than seeking universal condemnation [40:00:00]. Such acts are seen as a way to gain "respect and legitimacy" among those who believe armed resistance is the only solution [39:31:00].

Rafa Zimerman, a Brazilian survivor of the festival attack, recounted the overwhelming terror: missiles, sirens, smoke grenades causing suffocation, and relentless gunfire [00:45:02]. He described lying among bodies, pretending to be dead, while hearing cries of "Ala wba" [00:49:48]. He explicitly stated that the attackers were "animals," not people concerned with peace, and that they "attacked the world," not just Jews or Israelis [00:50:08]. This brutality, including setting fire to houses and executing people one by one, resonated with scenes reminiscent of the Islamic State [02:25:23].

## Geopolitical Implications
The recent attack, considered the largest terrorist attack in Israel's history and its 9/11 [08:35:00], has significant [[geopolitical_analysis_and_implications | geopolitical analysis and implications]].

### Internal Division and External Threat
Prior to the attack, Israeli society was deeply divided by [[the_role_of_technology_in_changing_political_landscapes | political polarization]] and protests against judicial reform, leading to a focus on internal matters rather than external threats [11:50:00]. This internal division, coupled with Netanyahu's government's emphasis on operations in the West Bank due to ultra-religious nationalist elements [14:25:00], led to a misjudgment that Gaza was safe and Hamas was quiet [15:44:00]. However, the attack had the opposite effect, uniting Israel in a "single government" to defend the country [01:09:00]. The national identity of Israel has always been "forged in combat," making unity in the face of attack a natural response [01:13:32].

### External Support and Regional Instability
Hamas's actions are supported and financed primarily by Iran, and previously by Qatar and Türkiye [02:40:00]. Meetings involving Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah had been ongoing since April, planning the attack [03:17:50]. This points to [[the_role_of_geopolitical_alliances_and_tensions_in_the_middle_east | the role of geopolitical alliances and tensions in the Middle East]].

The attack's timing also coincided with an impending agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which likely bothered the perpetrators [02:46:00]. This suggests a broader strategy to destabilize regional peace initiatives.

### The Problem of Classification and Recognition
There is a crucial need for international unanimity in labeling Hamas as a terrorist organization [02:14:44]. Some entities, including the Brazilian government, initially issued neutral statements, condemning terrorism without explicitly naming Hamas [02:13:51]. However, the sheer brutality of the attack, with its clear intent to inflict terror and disregard for human life, forces a re-evaluation [02:15:11]. Netanyahu explicitly compared Hamas to ISIS, a group universally condemned for its barbarism [02:15:19]. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a Palestinian by origin, outright stated that Hamas should "disappear" because they are "wild animals" who do not represent the Palestinian people and hinder their prosperity [03:00:24].

### Future Implications
This event will be remembered as "the most terrible day and sad history of the Jewish people since the end of the holocaust" [02:45:28]. It is expected to be called the "Sukkot War," after the Jewish holiday during which it occurred [02:34:40].

The attack brings to the forefront the issue of nuclear proliferation, particularly concerning Iran's nuclear program [02:59:24]. Israel, with or without U.S. aid, will likely escalate its efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, seeing it as an existential threat [02:00:15]. An Iran with nuclear weapons, especially given its support for groups like Hamas, could lead to "nuclear terrorism" and a "gigantic nightmare" for global security [02:07:07]. This incident, therefore, serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and dangers of [[the_role_of_geopolitical_alliances_and_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical alliances and tensions in the Middle East]] and the potential for an escalation of conflicts.

The attack has also united Israel's population, dissolving previous [[the_role_of_technology_in_changing_political_landscapes | political divisions]] and protests [01:09:00]. This unity is rooted in the collective trauma and a shared determination to defeat the enemy [01:14:04].

> [!note] Converging Crises
> The world is currently experiencing a "convergence of crises and problems" including interstate wars, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, instability, populism, polarization, and extremisms, all compounded by the rapid spread of [[influence_and_impact_of_media | information through social media]] [02:55:17].

The narrative of "concentration camp" or "open-air prison" for Gaza, often used to justify Hamas's actions, is deemed false [02:17:18]. Egypt's refusal to fully open its border with Gaza stems from its assessment of Hamas as a dangerous terrorist organization [02:22:41]. Ultimately, the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza is largely attributed to the "wrong decisions of the Palestinian leadership" and Hamas's dictatorial rule, which has massacred political rivals and created a "terrible place" [02:51:11]. The conflict highlights a [[the_relationship_between_geopolitics_and_religion | religious element]] in the struggle for land and values [02:34:42].

> [!caution] The Human Cost
> The Israeli death toll, proportionally, is higher than that of September 11th in the United States [01:57:56]. Stories of torture, dismemberment, mass executions, and parents murdered in front of children are emerging [02:25:16]. This graphic reality makes it impossible for any "decent and sensible person" to support Hamas's actions [02:11:52].

The current situation is an "unprecedented catastrophe" for Israel, the Middle East, and the world [02:11:34]. The global response, including the deployment of American aircraft carriers, serves as a message to dissuade any group from attempting a larger, joint attack aimed at overthrowing Israel [03:55:27]. This reflects Israel's long [[historical_influence_on_geopolitics | history of being forged in combat]] and its readiness to fight for survival [01:33:05].

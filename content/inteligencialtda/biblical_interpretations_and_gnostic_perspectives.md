This article explores various [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_trinity | biblical interpretations]] and [[philosophy_and_theological_interpretations | Gnostic perspectives]] on [[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | spiritual themes]] and religious narratives, contrasting traditional views with alternative, often speculative, accounts.

## Jesus's Early Life and Missing Years

The Bible has no mention of Jesus's life between the ages of 14 and 20, a period of approximately six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Speculations exist that he traveled to India during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This information is considered "spiritual revelation" or "gossip" and cannot be definitively stamped as true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

The Bible mentions Jesus's family pilgrimage to Jerusalem when he was around 9-11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Joseph and Mary, assuming Jesus was with others in their caravan, realized he was missing after a day's journey and returned to Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. After three days of searching, they found him in the Sanhedrin, listening to and questioning the doctors of the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. When Mary admonished him, Jesus replied, "You do not know that I came into this world to take care of my father's interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. From a conventional perspective, a 10-11-year-old child responding this way might be seen as having a "problematic temperament" or "psychosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### The Figure of Rockman

During this encounter in the Sanhedrin, Jesus reportedly questioned the doctors about "Rockman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. He asked who Rockman was, and when informed he was an "authority who lived with God," Jesus questioned what kind of authority could "fix" things God had done, implying a knowledge beyond God's perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. This name appears in the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, or one of the books of the Septuagint, which corresponds to the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

Joseph, Jesus's father, later asked Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy Jewish-Roman merchant and scholar of mysteries, about Rockman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Joseph of Arimathea also did not know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Years later, after Joseph's death, Joseph of Arimathea convinced Mary to allow Jesus (between 16-17 and 24-25 years old) to travel with his caravans to various places, including Persia, India, and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. This allowed Jesus to meet people who might answer his questions and provided him with a role as a manager for the caravans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

## Formation of the Christian Bible and Church

### Selection of Gospels

In the 4th century, there were approximately 4,000 Gospels available from Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. When Christianity transitioned from being a persecuted religion to the state religion under Emperor Constantine (who converted on the advice of his mother, Helena), the process of sifting and selecting these texts began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

Jerome, a polemicist from Alexandria, was hired by Damaso, the first Pope of the Catholic Church, to translate these thousands of manuscripts (originally in Aramaic and Greek) into Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. His task was to determine what would be officially accepted by the Catholic Church (canonical Gospels) and what would be considered "heresy" or apocryphal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### The Council of Nicaea and the Trinity

In 325 AD, Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, bringing together bishops from over a hundred Christian churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. This council transformed Christianity into Catholicism and "created the myth of the Holy Trinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>. This invention aimed to end the idea of "man Jesus" by elevating Jesus to God status, creating the Holy Trinity to assert that Jesus was "just like his father" (a father who was no longer the God of the Jews) and adding the Holy Spirit, a character Jesus never explicitly spoke of as himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>.

The speaker argues that this concept of the Holy Trinity was an invention of Catholicism to obscure the human side of Jesus and the God of the Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. Many Catholics cannot even identify the "God of the Holy Trinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>. [[philosophy_and_theological_interpretations | Philosophy]] itself, after Thomas Aquinas's *Summa Theologica*, often served to confirm Catholic dogma rather than seeking truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:07]</a>.

### Distortion of God's Image and Justification by Faith

Traditional theology describes God as so loving that He sacrificed His "only son" as a "Lamb to pay with his blood the sins of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>. The speaker challenges this notion, questioning if any parent would do this to their child and if an omnipotent God would need blood sacrifice for sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>. These theological justifications are deemed "ridiculous, simple, hollow and worst of all dishonest about human logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>.

For Catholicism, the Church's [[interpretation_of_the_bible_and_literary_genres | interpretation]] of God's word, or dogma, is what matters, not necessarily the literal text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>. Martin Luther challenged this, advocating for literal belief in the Bible, which led to Protestantism. However, the speaker notes that Protestantism faces a similar issue as each pastor interprets the Bible differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.

Paul is credited with creating the concept of "justification by faith" and "salvation," ideas that Jesus himself never explicitly taught. Jesus taught that each person would be judged "according to his works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. Paul introduced the idea that merely believing in Jesus's sacrifice for sins leads to salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.

## Faces of Jesus and Mary Magdalene's Role

The speaker describes three "faces" of Jesus in [[historical_interpretations_of_biblical_events | human history]]:

1.  **Jesus the Galilean**: Created by the 11 remaining Apostles (excluding Judas Iscariot), who believed Jesus's message was only for Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Jesus the Christ (Marvel Superstar)**: Invented by Paul, who, after a vision of the resurrected Jesus, began spreading Christianity to the rest of the world, contrary to the Apostles' initial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>. The term "Christ" (meaning "the anointed one") was not used for Jesus during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.
3.  **Jesus the Living One**: After his resurrection, Jesus reportedly gave a "new revelation" to [[biblical_interpretation_of_mary_magdalene | Mary Magdalene]] and a group of his Hellenic (Greek-speaking) disciples (not the Apostles, who were mostly illiterate Galileans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. Mary Magdalene became a "great exponent of Christianity" at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

### The Gnostic Gospels and Suppressed Knowledge

[[biblical_interpretation_of_mary_magdalene | Mary Magdalene]] and her group organized "dozens of manuscripts" in the 1st century that were "the most important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>. However, the Catholic Church in the 4th century "preferred to delete" her influence and writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.

The revelations given to [[biblical_interpretation_of_mary_magdalene | Mary Magdalene]] contained "strange things" that the Church preferred to suppress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. For instance, Jesus said that those who seek and find the truth "will be stunned" and then "will reign over the process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. The resurrected Jesus spoke about the Biblical God (Yahweh), whom he previously called "Abba" (father), using Plato's term "demiurge" to describe Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. This is where [[philosophy_and_theological_interpretations | Gnosticism]] emerged, referring to "true knowledge" (gnosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>.

However, some Gnostics went further, calling the God of Israel the "devil," which Jesus never did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. The Catholic Church, in the 4th century, sought to reconcile Yahweh as the "God of the Jews" with Jesus as a "hero" after his crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

### Suppressed Biblical Books

Jerome, in creating the modern Bible, removed the Book of Enoch from the Septuagint, reducing the Old Testament from 47 to 46 books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>. The Book of Enoch was considered more important because it announced Yahweh's Messiah, Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>. Enoch also spoke of the "rebellion of angels" and the cosmogony of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. This removal aimed to "dispel the myths" of Judaism for the emerging Christian religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>.

In 376 AD, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria decreed the destruction of all Gnostic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>. Monks of the Monastery of St. Pachomius in Egypt, who were translating books by [[biblical_interpretation_of_mary_magdalene | Mary Magdalene]] and others, hid them in caves in the 6th century to escape burning by the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>. These hidden texts, now known as the Nag Hammadi library (discovered in 1945), include the Gnostic Gospels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.

### Jesus's Descent into Hell (Hades)

In the Gnostic Gospel of Bartholomew, Bartholomew asks the resurrected Jesus where he went when he disappeared from the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Jesus replies that he took "500 steps towards hell" to speak with Hades and Belial (Baal), the "owners of hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">[01:18:33]</a>. His purpose was to free the souls of humans, imprisoned since the time of Adam and the patriarchs, from the "archons of the first heaven... fourth heaven of this neighboring universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. From this point on, humans could die without their souls being trapped at these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.

## Concepts of Evil and the Creator

Traditional religions attribute evil to concepts like "original sin" or figures like the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. However, many ancient mythologies, which often provide explanations for the gaps in theology, state that evil originates from the creator himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

### The Cosmic Egg and the Fallen Creator

Across over a hundred mythologies studied, a common "monomyth" is the "cosmic egg," representing the cosmogenesis of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Modern science's Big Bang theory, describing a singularity of quarks and gluons expanding to create everything, is seen as a transformation of this ancient myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

Chinese mythology speaks of a cosmic egg from which Yin, Yang, and Pangu (the "fallen creator") emerged. Pangu reconstructed himself from his own "leftovers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Hindu mythology mentions the "Brahma Ananda" (egg of Brahma), from which Brahma, the creator, "fell into one of the holes," creating a "biological universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

This implies a "problem in the time of creation" where the creator "fell" or "made a mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. This "fall" is described as literal: a quantum creator attempting to manifest an idea, making an error, and collapsing into a "black hole" within its own creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. This fallen creator, reconstructed from its "rotten parts," then "does everything wrong or very badly," thus being the source of "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

According to mythologies, the initial psychic trait of this fallen creator was to "survive at any cost" within its creation, corrupting its code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This corrupted code, passed down through the human genome, forces humans into a predatory existence where they "take from others killing by corruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

### Religious Distortion of Evil

Religions, emerging in the last 4,000 years, are said to have "canceled" these mythological explanations to create a new "myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. They took this fallen creator (Yahweh) and denied his imperfection, portraying him as a perfect being who makes no mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. The creation myth in Genesis is seen as a copy of the Sumerian-Akkadian myth Enuma Elish, where God creates and "sees that it was good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

Saint Augustine of Hippo, in the 4th century, is credited with enforcing the dogma that life is "wonderful" and that humans must "thank God for the gift of life," despite observable suffering and the predatory nature of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. This led to the "myth of original sin," blaming humans for sin and requiring rituals like baptism to cleanse children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

### Lucifer, Satan, and Baphomet

The figures of Lucifer and Satan are largely "invention" according to the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. While such beings exist, their traditional portrayal is a construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. The concept of a specific personification of evil did not exist in earlier mythologies in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

The speaker attributes the popular image of the devil with horns to a "dirty detour" by the Vatican and King Philip IV of France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. The Templars, who aimed to separate the historical Jesus from Judaism and establish a unified Europe, worshipped a "great head of wisdom" called Chokmah (from Kabbalah), a divine personification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. This head, often depicted with horns in art as a symbol of intelligence, was named Baphomet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. When the Pope and Philip moved to suppress the Templars, they demonized Baphomet, making it synonymous with the devil, leading to the Catholic belief in the horned devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

## Angels and Demons

The speaker clarifies that the common understanding of angels and demons is largely a human construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>. The terms "angel" and "god" were often misapplied to non-human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. While previously there were "good gods, bad gods, sick gods," and "good angels, fallen angels, bad angels, sick angels," Judaism simplified this to "good angel" and "bad demon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

From the perspective of the fallen creator (Yahweh), angels are "robotic beings," "Clones" that replicate the same DNA and obey Yahweh without individuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. Demons, or "daiva" in Sanskrit, emerged when a "Clone" spirit awakened consciousness and "attacked Yahweh" to stop his monstrous creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>. This spirit's body was destroyed, but its magnetized spirit transformed into a new type of being called "demon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>. These beings metamorphose and are similar to "genies of the lamp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

The concept of angels as "winged beings" or "scary figures" (like in Ezekiel) are often human interpretations of what might be machines, ships, or unidentified flying objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>. These beings, whether angelic or demonic, are not inherently good or evil; they are robotic and obey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. Some are described as "totally cold," devoid of humor, but not necessarily scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>.

The name "angel" itself only appeared in Jewish culture during the Babylonian captivity, assimilated from Babylonian and Chaldean traditions through figures like Prophet Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. Later, Greek Hellenistic culture further integrated these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

## Other Worlds and Extraterrestrial Influence

The Bible, in Genesis, speaks of the "Nefel" (Sumerian term for aliens) being "on Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. This term implies they were not always here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>. Akkadians called them "Anun" (Anunnaki), who arrived 450,000 years ago and created clans on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. Some Anunnaki were "earthlings" born here, feeling ownership of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

These beings mixed their genetics with humans, leading to "semigods" or "demigods" in Greek, Hindu, and Sumerian-Akkadian mythologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. The giants mentioned in the Bible are interpreted as a distortion of the "Nefel," and the flood was an attempt to eradicate this mixed race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>. Yahweh reportedly ordered Moses to "pass all members to the sword" of certain ethnic groups, including children and animals, to leave "no DNA" of these mixed beings (Igigi with humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.

Gilgamesh, a demigod, sought a hidden Anunnaki launch base in the Middle East (present-day Lebanon) to fly to where the gods were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

### Megalithic Constructions and Star Alignments

Evidence of alien influence is suggested in megalithic constructions worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>. The "Legend of the Seven Sages Builders" states that after a cataclysm around 14,000 years ago, descendants of survivors (from Hyperborea and Lemuria) spread across Earth and built structures designed to resist future disasters, such as pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:26">[02:40:26]</a>.

Robert Bauval, an Egyptologist, observed that the three pyramids of Giza are misaligned in the same way as the three stars of Orion's Belt (the Three Marys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:13">[02:42:13]</a>. Calculations revealed an exact match to the tenth decimal place, indicating a deliberate design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Using computer programs, it was determined that Orion's Belt was in that exact position about 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:04">[02:44:04]</a>. Similar alignments are found with the Sphinx (looking at the constellation of Leo 12,450 years ago) and the Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia (matching the constellation of Draco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:10">[02:44:10]</a>.

This suggests that ancient megalithic constructions were built at different times but all represent the sky as it was 12,400 to 12,450 years ago, as if someone "taken a picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>. These structures were intended to carry messages for future generations, which largely remain undeciphered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:26">[02:46:26]</a>.

The Dogon tribe in Mali, Africa, have a cultural summary indicating knowledge of the Sirius star system (Sirius A, B, and C) for thousands of years, predating Western scientific discovery of Sirius B and C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. They claim their ancestors came from a planet revolving around Sirius C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:35">[02:49:35]</a>. They also state that the three pyramids of Egypt represent the mass and volume ratios of the three Sirius stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:46">[02:49:46]</a>.

These revelations suggest that humans were "created by beings that have ever existed here on Earth," and these beings were "not human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>.

## Human Condition and Future

The speaker asserts that humanity is currently experiencing a "dystopian time" where nothing functions as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Humanity's biggest obstacle to progress is the "weight of religious faith childishly understood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. Blaming an "evil being" is an easy way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

Humanity tends to accumulate problems in all areas of life, hoping "God will resolve everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:20">[02:45:20]</a>. This type of belief, which assumes a personal God who caters to human whims, is considered "ridiculous" and a "misuse" of the concept of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:59">[02:45:59]</a>.

The speaker suggests that "wisdom will come through our suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, and that humans are "corrupt monstrosities" but also capable of great acts of kindness and self-sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:10">[02:53:10]</a>. The core responsibility lies with humans to change the world by being the change they wish to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:27">[02:31:27]</a>.

### Reincarnation and the Self

Reincarnation is affirmed as a reality. When the physical body dies, the "self" continues to exist "uninterruptedly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>. This self, composed of emotional stickers, memories, and feelings, is distinct from the physical body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:20">[01:56:20]</a>.

According to ancient Hindu-Aryan tradition (Upanishads), a human being is composed of seven bodies: a physical body, three "lower quaternary" bodies (related to emotions, sensations, and concepts/attitudes), and three "Immortal Triad" bodies (atmic/soul, buddhic, and higher mental) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:57">[02:05:57]</a>.

When the physical body dies, the lower quaternary bodies should also die to release the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>. However, if these lower bodies retain "negative" or "disturbing files" (e.g., addictions, unresolved conflicts), they become anchored to the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>. The Immortal Triad then needs to "produce new bodies" to process this "dirty code from previous life," leading to reincarnation until these issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:42">[02:14:42]</a>. This process is not an act of love but a "brutal mess," a "selfish need" with no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>.

Humans are born with an "incarnational program" limited by files and baggage from many lives, but within this, they have a degree of free will to decide *how* they will face predetermined challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>.

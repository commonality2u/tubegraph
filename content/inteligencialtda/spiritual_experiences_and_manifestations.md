Spiritual experiences and manifestations are central to understanding the divine and supernatural realm, as described through personal testimonies and scriptural interpretations. These experiences range from profound inner peace and divine communication to encounters with spiritual entities and the manifestation of spiritual gifts.

## Personal Encounters with the Divine

Individuals can experience profound encounters with God, often marked by a sense of peace and direct communication.
*   A speaker recounted an experience at age 10-12 on a mountain, where he felt a great peace and the conviction that there must be a God, without anyone influencing him [00:08:52].
*   Years later, in Rio de Janeiro, unable to sleep, he again remembered God and felt a "great peace" that he knew came from God, although he didn't know how to find Him [00:09:32].
*   After his first romantic heartbreak and a prayer, he heard the voice of God for the first time, described as strong and clear, saying, "my son you are very valuable for me and you will still see the great work that I will do in your life" [02:26:57]. This experience brought an immense peace he had never felt before, causing him to cry intensely despite not being prone to tears [02:27:17].

### Visions and Dreams
*   The speaker also experienced a vision of a "wizard guy in the middle of the woods" immediately after a powerful prayer vigil, which he later understood to be an action of the devil [02:49:23].
*   He also dreamt of preaching, a desire he initially dismissed due to shyness [02:57:52].
*   An experience of "waking up in a totally dark place" but feeling "a peace man a presence of God" was later explained by a pastor's testimony as an "anteroom" or space before the true heaven, akin to a portal [02:55:14].

### Prophetic Words and Confirmation
*   During a vigil, a woman prophesied over him, stating God would use him mightily, reach many people in Brazil and abroad, and that he would be a "shepherd" (pastor) [00:53:05]. This confirmed a secret dream he had been having about preaching [02:57:52].
*   Another prophetic word came from a pastor during a service, revealing personal details about his past and future marriage, confirming his call [01:12:51]. This kind of prophecy often serves to confirm what God is already speaking in a person's heart [02:40:02].

## Encounters with Negative Spiritual Influences

The speaker shared experiences from his youth that he later understood as interactions with negative spiritual forces.
*   Growing up, his family was Catholic but also frequented a [[Spiritist Center | Spiritist Center]] [00:07:46]. He noted that many people blend [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spiritualist and Catholic beliefs]] [00:07:56].
*   He recounted visiting a Candomblé terreiro (center) with a girlfriend whose family practiced the religion [01:36:56].
    *   The center was described as a large, dark room with few lights, adorned with images of saints and caboclos [01:55:10].
    *   People would consult a priest or entity who would "materialize" in a person, providing information or revelations [01:08:08].
    *   He witnessed people "squirming" and changing their positions, and a "goat laugh type" associated with "movie villain movie" [01:07:04].
    *   He also saw young men "shouting" and drinking cachaça while seemingly under the influence of an entity [01:09:09].
    *   An entity, incorporated in a person, gave him advice, including telling him to remove his earrings and stating that "the enemy is that really destroys relationship" [01:08:24]. The entity provided its name for him to call upon if he needed help [01:09:19].
    *   This experience led to the "worst week of my life" with constant thoughts of death, causing him to write a farewell letter to his family [02:20:32].

## Spiritual Gifts and Manifestations

The Holy Spirit empowers believers with various gifts.
*   **Speaking in Tongues:** The speaker sought and received the gift of speaking in tongues after a three-day fast [00:58:08]. He describes it as an "incredible experience" that brings "peace" and feels like speaking directly to God, or "the language of angels" [01:00:44, 01:19:05]. He notes that while the mind may become "fruitless" (not understanding), the spirit is edified [01:19:29].
    *   He clarifies that the gift of tongues, and other spiritual gifts, did not cease after Pentecost or with the apostles; they continue to operate today [01:15:59].
*   **Prophecy and Words of Knowledge/Wisdom:** He differentiates between the gift of prophesying (preaching the word of God) and gifts of words of knowledge (related to the past) and words of wisdom (related to the future) [02:37:35]. These gifts are meant to edify the church [02:55:54].

## Spiritual Warfare and Protection

The Christian life involves a constant [[spiritual_warfare_and_protective_practices | spiritual battle]] against demonic forces.
*   The devil and demons are described as real, organized, and constantly observing humans [03:09:55]. They try to blind people's understanding of the Gospel and deceive them [03:17:08, 03:27:28].
*   Demons can imitate God's actions, even performing "miracles," but they cannot imitate God's peace or holiness [03:22:20]. They operate through deception, using subtle suggestions or appearing as "angels of light" [03:02:00, 03:09:02].
*   [[Impact of negative spiritual influences and protection | Demonic oppression]] is a feeling of spiritual weight or discouragement, often occurring as retaliation for spiritual acts [03:28:48]. This happens when a person gives the enemy an "opening" or "gap" through unconfessed sin, unforgiveness, or vices [03:54:16, 03:57:07].
*   **Exorcism and Deliverance:** The speaker participated in [[Exorcism and spiritual warfare | exorcisms]] and deliverance sessions, where demons would manifest, speak sarcastically, accuse, and resist expulsion [03:03:27].
    *   The authority of the name of Jesus is crucial [03:13:09].
    *   Some cases require fasting and prayer due to a "hierarchy" of demons [03:07:56].
    *   A "new convert" cannot be a spiritual leader as they still need to mature and resolve personal issues before leading others [02:53:33].
    *   If a person's heart is not filled with the Holy Spirit after a demon leaves, the demon may return with more demons, leaving the person in a worse state [03:15:01].

## The Nature of the Spiritual World
*   The physical world coexists with a "spiritual world" [03:03:55].
*   The Bible describes three heavens: the sky we see, the second heaven where principalities and powers reside, and the third heaven, the glory of God [03:33:51].
*   Satan, though not omnipresent, "came from wandering through the land and pass through it and observe the earth" [03:09:50]. He is constantly watching and trying to influence human minds [03:09:55, 03:34:39].
*   The concept of "familiar spirits" is mentioned, describing demons that accompany families, perpetuating sins and vices across generations [03:55:58].
*   Spiritual practices like playing with Ouija boards or drawing certain symbols can facilitate access for demons [04:21:55, 04:26:00].
*   The speaker warns against "astral travel" and accessing "ports that God doesn't tell us to access," as these are "extremely dangerous" [04:18:54, 04:19:35].

## Views on Spiritual Phenomena
*   The speaker believes that all manifestations of the Holy Spirit, including speaking in tongues, are still active and available today, challenging the view that such gifts ceased after the apostolic age [01:15:59].
*   He emphasizes that God's plan is not to force obedience but to guide individuals who choose to follow His will [04:22:02].
*   The "law" (Old Testament commandments) serves to reveal sin and demonstrate humanity's inability to save itself, while "grace" (through Jesus' sacrifice) provides salvation and empowerment by the Holy Spirit [04:06:54]. True transformation comes from the Holy Spirit, not from human effort to follow rules [04:36:39, 04:49:50].
*   He argues against religious extremism and rigid rules, stating that God's love and grace, rather than fear of punishment, lead to true repentance [04:33:34, 04:35:10, 04:38:51].
*   While some "secular" things like music or movies can be problematic if they pull one away from God, not everything outside of explicitly religious contexts is inherently bad [04:34:50, 04:38:00]. Personal discernment is key, focusing on whether something hinders one's relationship with God [04:39:16].
*   The existence of aliens is discussed, with the speaker stating his personal belief that there is no other life [05:07:04]. He also mentions the "Flat Earth theory" and "Project Blue Bean" (a conspiracy theory about projecting images into the sky to deceive people) as examples of how deception can operate [05:13:33, 05:16:16].
*   The speaker firmly believes in angels and demons as described in the Bible [05:22:15].

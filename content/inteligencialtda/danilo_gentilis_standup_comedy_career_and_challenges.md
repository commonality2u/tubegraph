[[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili]] has a background as an old comedian and was part of the first stand-up groups in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His career has faced numerous persecutions and attempts to trip him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Discovery of Stand-up Comedy
Gentili grew up enjoying entertainment figures like Jerry Lewis, who would elegantly tell stories on stage in a suit and tie, making people laugh without telling traditional jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:12">[02:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. At the time, he didn't know what this style of performance was called, as the jokes he was familiar with were from comedians like Costinha and Ary Toledo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:12">[02:35:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:12">[02:39:12]</a>.

Access to information about stand-up comedy was limited in Brazil, particularly for someone like Gentili who didn't have internet access until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He would work during the day and wait until midnight to use free dial-up internet from iG when the cost was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. It was through this research that he discovered the art form he loved was called "stand-up comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Initially, he believed there was no stand-up comedy in Brazil, though he later saw Grace Gianoukas doing something similar on Jô Soares' show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Entry into the Stand-up Scene
In 2009, Gentili started his stand-up career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. He describes the early days of stand-up in Brazil as being "in the dark," with no one to guide newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He joined an Orkut community for stand-up comedy created by Henrique Pantarotto, where he began exchanging ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

He performed his first show at Beverly Hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, where many early Brazilian stand-up comedians like Marcela Leal, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, and Márcio Ribeiro also started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Marcela Leal played a crucial role in his early career, inviting him to perform after reading his text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. His debut set included three small jokes about his first time, Silvio Santos's "Roda a Roda" game, and McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. He received positive feedback for his first performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Forming "Comédia Ao Vivo"
As the stand-up scene developed, disagreements arose among comedians, particularly regarding where to perform. Rafinha Bastos was initially against moving from bar venues to theaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Gentili, wanting to grow and facing resistance from some established comedians at the Comedy Club, decided to create his own stand-up night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. He named it "Comédia Ao Vivo" (Live Comedy) and secured a bar in Moema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

He presented his vision using a PowerPoint presentation, inviting other comedians like Márcio Ribeiro, Robson Nunes, and Luiz França <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Márcio Ribeiro was the first to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He also helped a female comedian, Juliana, write her texts, highlighting her raw, honest personality that he believed would resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Gentili also desired to include [[cristian_paivas_standup_and_comedy_career | Rogério Morgado]] in his project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

The "Comédia Ao Vivo" group, which included Gentili, Márcio Ribeiro, and Tortorelli, achieved early success, consistently drawing crowds to the bar with its famous "June wall" backdrop seen in early videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Conflicts in the Scene
Danilo Gentili faced several [[challenges_of_being_a_comedian | challenges]] and internal conflicts within the comedy scene:
*   **Competition and Boycotts:** When "Comédia Ao Vivo" launched, Rafinha Bastos, who had not allowed Gentili into the Comedy Club, initially resisted the idea of another stand-up night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. However, Márcio Ribeiro, Diogo Portugal, and Marcela Leal supported Gentili joining the Club, but Rafinha's opposition prevented it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Gentili noted that while he was in both major stand-up groups, he was the only one allowed to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Attacks and Disloyalty:** Gentili recounts instances where he felt betrayed or unfairly targeted by other comedians. For example, he helped assemble a script team for Marcos Mion's "Legendários" show with "love" and introduced him to talents like Maurício Meirelles, Leo Lins, and Marcela Leal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. However, after the show launched, the "Legendários" team began trying to mess with CQC, where Gentili worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He views this as "ingratitude" and a "lack of character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Pressure and Criticism:** He describes internal conflicts within Band's "Agora É Tarde" show, where he faced constant battles over creative decisions and poor working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This period of stress caused him to lose his beard and become swollen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Humor and Political Controversy
Danilo Gentili's humor style has consistently pushed boundaries, leading to significant [[media_coverage_and_controversies_involving_danilo_gentili | media coverage and controversies]]. He believes comedians must have the freedom to mock the president and political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

### The Politically Incorrect Show (2010)
In 2010, during an election period, Gentili performed a "politically incorrect" stand-up show at the National Theater in Brasília, which was broadcast live on UOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He made "heavy jokes" about political figures like Lula and Dilma, as well as others like Serra, Aécio, and Collor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This show, which was a departure from what anyone had done before, marked the beginning of sustained criticism and targeting by the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### "Milk Donor" Incident (2013)
In 2013, on his show "Agora É Tarde," Gentili made a joke about a Brazilian woman seeking to enter the Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest breast milk donor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The joke's premise, written by a screenwriter, implied she lost her spot to Kid Bengala (a famous adult film actor), playing on the absurdity and common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

Weeks later, media outlets, particularly those associated with the Workers' Party (PT), published headlines alleging that Gentili had called her a "cow" and caused her milk to dry up, leading to her crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Gentili vehemently denies ever calling her a "cow" or having a sexist intent, explaining that the joke was based on a public news story and a play on words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. He characterizes this as a "fake news machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, where a narrative was created to portray him as a "white male oppressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This incident led to a lawsuit against him, which he lost despite presenting evidence that he never used the offensive term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Impact and Personal Philosophy
Gentili notes that following the 2010 show, the perception of his humor shifted from "humor" to "offense," leading to the ongoing debate about the "limit of humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. He believes this division has worsened over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Despite the [[media_coverage_and_controversies_involving_danilo_gentili | controversies]] and legal battles, Gentili maintains that he will continue to do what he believes is right, regardless of changes in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. He views humor as being inherently "against" the establishment and emphasizes the importance of continuing to joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. His approach to dealing with disloyalty and attacks is to remove harmful people from his life for practicality, rather than seeking revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He remains confident in his path, believing that "the worse the better" for comedy, as it generates more material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

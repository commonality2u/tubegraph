"Limited Intelligence" is a podcast hosted by Rogério Vila, where the stated aim is that the "limitation of Intelligence happens only by the presenter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This suggests a dynamic where the host positions himself as less knowledgeable than his guests.

## Format and Audience Interaction
The program features discussions with various guests, ranging from comedians to intellectuals like Ana Beatriz and Pondé, whose presence makes listeners feel "limited" in certain complex subjects, though they may understand well in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Audience participation is encouraged through "Super Chat," where viewers can submit questions or comments. The show typically reads up to five comments, or more if the questions are particularly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Viewers are also encouraged to subscribe to the channel, like the video, and activate notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Topics Discussed

## Milestones and Future Plans
The podcast celebrated its 3-year anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:10:56">[3:10:56]</a> and has already recorded over 153 episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:10">[1:19:10]</a>. Rogério states he has been doing the podcast with "pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:14:39">[3:14:39]</a> and mentions a personal goal to reach 1000 episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:12:38">[3:12:38]</a>. The team is also working on new programs and a pilot for a new show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:14:14">[3:14:14]</a>. The podcast aims to maintain an exciting and dynamic discussion, acknowledging the rapid changes in the topics they cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:20">[1:18:20]</a>.

Rogério Vila encourages listeners to "study Artificial Intelligence" rather than complaining about job loss, as technology is advancing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:55">[1:11:55]</a>. He also emphasizes that the program aims to provide valuable information and encourages engagement with complex subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:45:23">[2:45:23]</a>.

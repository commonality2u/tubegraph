From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

A historic podcast brought together a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Pastor to expand knowledge and explore commonalities and differences among their religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The aim was to cross-reference information and discern what is common and what is unusual across their faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The host emphasized an environment of "unlimited intelligence" due to the guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Featured Guests

The panel included:
*   **A Rabbi** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **A Priest** (Father Joãozinho, making his first appearance on the show) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **A Pastor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

### Introductions and Initial Interactions

The host jokingly mentioned that first-time guests usually bring a "useless gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Father Joãozinho immediately presented two gifts: a pen that ran out of ink, symbolizing the desire for the pandemic to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>, and a bottle of hand sanitizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. The pen was significant, being from the Marial Academy of Aparecida (AMA), an academy reflecting on the figure of Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. Father Joãozinho also shared that he wrote a book with the support of a consultant specializing in biblical archaeology in Israel, [[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Rodrigo Silva]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. This book, titled "True Story of the Virgin Mary," discusses a Jewish Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>.

[[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Rodrigo Silva]] noted that he and Father Joãozinho had the same master's supervisor, Father Libânio, and their reunion on the podcast was historic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:12">[03:22:12]</a>.

## Key Themes and Discussions

The conversation quickly moved beyond introductory pleasantries to deep theological and [[spiritual_topics_and_debates | spiritual topics and debates]].

### Intelligence and Faith
The podcast title "limited intelligence" was explained by the host as an acknowledgement of his own limitations, being open to learning everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>. The term "intelligence" (intelligere in Latin) means "to read inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>.
A core discussion revolved around "intelligent faith," distinguishing it from fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>. It was argued that faith is not the opposite of intelligence; rather, intelligent faith seeks to read inwardly and understand deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>.

### Ecumenism vs. Inter-religious Dialogue
The discussion clarified the difference between ecumenism and inter-religious dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>:
*   **Ecumenism** is a more official movement, often initiated by the Catholic Church, seeking to unite churches in an official manner through bodies like the Council of Churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **Inter-religious dialogue** is what was happening on the podcast – individuals from different faiths engaging in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. The aim is not to convert each other but to dialogue respectfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.

### The Nature of God
All three guests affirmed belief in the same God, the Creator, who is omniscient and omnipresent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. The Rabbi emphasized that this God cannot be fully understood, as understanding would make one equal to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. Faith is about experiencing God even when understanding is absent, trusting in a greater force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.

Christianity, particularly Catholicism, highlights God's constant presence ("God is with us") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:17">[04:51:17]</a>. The concept of God becoming flesh, as in Jesus Christ, is a radical expression of this divine presence and a point of divergence with Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:17">[04:51:17]</a>. The Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) illustrates God as a communion in Christian theology, which is distinct from the Jewish concept of one God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:17">[04:51:17]</a>.

### Faith, Doctrine, and Relationship
A distinction was made between "doctrinal faith" (fides quae) and "relational faith" (fides qua) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.
*   **Doctrinal faith** refers to beliefs, dogmas, and codes (e.g., fasting on Yom Kippur, using a kippah, belief in the Holy Sacrament, or Jesus' return and Sabbath keeping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.
*   **Relational faith** is a personal relationship with the Creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. Doctrinal beliefs only gain meaning when underpinned by this personal relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

### The Virginity of Mary and Sabbath Observance
A specific theological debate arose regarding the virginity of Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:16">[07:52:16]</a>. The Catholic Church has three levels of dogma concerning Mary's virginity. The third level, Mary remaining a virgin after childbirth, was deemed too complex for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:25">[08:24:25]</a>. The second level, Mary remaining a virgin during childbirth, was a point of contention, with [[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Pastor Rodrigo Silva]], an Adventist, defending it by linking it to Eve's sin and Mary's sinless nature, suggesting she would not have experienced childbirth pains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:54">[09:55:54]</a>.

The topic of Sabbath observance was also raised. [[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Pastor Rodrigo Silva]] (Adventist) observes Saturday, while Father Joãozinho (Catholic) observes Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The discussion highlighted that such differences exist respectfully, with each person making their own decision based on their convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Salvation and Works
A key theological divergence was on salvation. From a Pauline (Christian) view, salvation is not meritorious; works are not the means or cause of salvation but its result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>. This contrasts with the Jewish thought where keeping the Torah or the law is meritorious for salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>. The Rabbi emphasized that human beings have a divine particle and should strive to be like God, acquiring merit through their own efforts and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>. The Pastor, however, reiterated that merit comes from Christ's death on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.

### The Hope of Paradise and Eschatology
The discussion touched upon the concept of longing for Paradise and the end times (eschatology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   The Jewish perspective sees life as a corridor to the "great hall" of the world to come, where one plants good deeds to reap rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:01">[04:40:01]</a>. Meritocracy and free will are central, enabling individuals to choose righteousness despite bad inclinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:01">[04:40:01]</a>.
*   Christians (Adventists and Catholics) believe in the second coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. Adventists believe Jesus' first coming was humble, and his second will be in glory and majesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. Catholics share this belief in the definitive coming of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>.
*   Judaism awaits the coming of the "Mashiach" (Messiah), who will be a wise descendant of King David, rebuild the Third Temple, return Jews to Israel, and bring world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:04">[03:12:04]</a>.

### The Role of Miracles and Gratitude
The conversation also covered miracles and the importance of recognizing the wonder in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:29">[03:40:29]</a>. The Rabbi stressed the practice of prayer three times a day, which includes thanking God for daily miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:29">[03:40:29]</a>. Father Joãozinho highlighted that "miracle is a wonder," and recognizing them is crucial for happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:29">[03:40:29]</a>.

## Personal Stories and Learning

### [[pastor_antnio_juniors_spiritual_journey_and_transformation | Pastor Antnio Junior's spiritual journey and transformation]] and Academic Pursuits
[[pastor_antnio_juniors_spiritual_journey_and_transformation | Pastor Rodrigo Silva]] recounted his academic journey, pursuing a Master's degree with Jesuits despite being an Adventist, seeking out the best teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. He faced initial resistance from some teachers due to his differing views but was also supported by others, like Father Francisco Taborda, who respected his conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>. He later pursued a doctorate, initially facing expulsion due to conflicting ideas but was helped by Father Johan Comblin to restart his studies at Our Lady of the Assumption College (now linked to PUC-SP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:05]</a>. He also pursued a third doctorate in Spiritual Theology in Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.

### [[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Rodrigo Silva's]] Archaeological Work
[[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Rodrigo Silva]] is the director and curator of an archaeology museum in Engenheiro Coelho, São Paulo, housing over two thousand original pieces allowed by the Department of Antiquities of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. He shared a significant discovery: a brick from Babylon, brought to Brazil by a Mendes Júnior employee, containing a cuneiform inscription from Nebuchadnezzar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. Initially dated to 300 years before the common era, further research and analysis in London revealed it was from the Temple of Ezagila, burned by Alexander the Great's soldiers, refining its historical accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. This brick, an external inscription of the Temple of Ezagila, would have been read by [[about_rodrigo_silva_and_his_contributions | Daniel]], a Jew in Babylonian captivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

### The Significance of Language and Names
The discussion delved into the deep meaning of Hebrew words and names. The name "Moses" (Moché) is rooted in the idea of being "drawn from the waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:19">[02:18:19]</a>. The Hebrew language itself is seen as sacred, the language through which the universe was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:16">[02:20:16]</a>. Translating Hebrew texts can lose much of their essence, as each word embodies the essence of the thing it names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:16">[02:20:16]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_interactions_within_and_between_different_religious_communities | Challenges and interactions within and between different religious communities]]
The guests touched on sensitive topics like [[relation_between_protestantism_and_judaism | Protestantism and Judaism]] during the Holocaust, noting that while some individuals from various faiths (priests, pastors) acted as heroes, saving Jews, others were prejudiced or even betrayed Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>. [[pastor_antnio_juniors_spiritual_journey_and_transformation | Pastor Rodrigo Silva]] recounted his personal experience of facing accusations of being a "Jesuit spy" by some Protestants due to his academic background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

A poignant story from a concentration camp highlighted how some Jews, despite extreme suffering, shared their only blanket in the harsh winter, while others hoarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:26">[02:41:26]</a>. This illustrated that human character is revealed in adversity. Viktor Frankl's logotherapy was mentioned, noting that those who survived the camps were often intellectuals who could find meaning by recalling past experiences or meditating, emphasizing the importance of culture and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:26">[02:41:26]</a>.

### Lessons from Shared Traditions
The discussion underscored the importance of respect and finding common ground, despite doctrinal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>. The "Golden Rule" (do not do to others what you would not like done to you, and love your neighbor as yourself) was cited as a core principle shared by both Judaism (from Hillel) and Christianity (from Jesus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:48">[02:47:48]</a>. This mutual respect and search for unity were deemed essential for humanity's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>.

The guests also discussed the broader context of [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | faith and spirituality discussions]] and the need for religious education that fosters sensitivity and reconnection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The importance of humility and the ongoing process of human evolution were also stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:59">[03:02:59]</a>.

The discussion concluded with a prayer for health and continued dedication to their shared mission of testifying to their faith, fostering love for God, and serving their fellow human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

Music and [[spirituality_and_personal_beliefs | personal beliefs]] are deeply intertwined, with sound holding significant power and influence over individuals and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. The connection between music and the divine is considered fundamental, dating back to creation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

## The Theology of Sound
Everything is believed to have sound, and sound is considered the mother of the arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. The Bible contains a theology of sound, indicating its profound significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>.

### Origin of Music
God is described as creating music, after which He established a structure in the sky for its organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. The initial chief of heavenly music was the anointed Guardian Cherub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>, who later became the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. This being was positioned at the altar of the Holy Mountain of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. The first musical instruments were prepared on the day this Cherub was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

## The Devil's Influence on Music
Despite his fall, the devil did not lose his power to create music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Isaiah 14:11 describes the devil fallen in hell with the sound of his music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. This power is used to weaken nations through seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>, primarily through sound and profane arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. The devil's music is considered unfair because it fills the interior with violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.

## No Neutral Music
It is asserted that no music is neutral; all music is inspired either from heaven or hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. Music from God is meant to liberate, transform, and change the soul, while music from the world releases negative spiritual influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. Listening to music not inspired by heaven can lead to oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

### Music as a Weapon
Music is considered one of Satan's greatest weapons, as it can release "sound curse" and negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Conversely, it is also one of God's greatest weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. Sound waves are described as perpetual, emphasizing the lasting impact of all music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

## The Choice: Sacred vs. Secular Music
Choosing to listen to and create only music inspired by heaven is seen as an act of [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality_in_personal_growth | personal growth]] and [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | faith]]. This means abandoning secular music to uphold holiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. The presenter's mother and father, Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes, were part of the "Novos Baianos" musical movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. Despite their secular musical backgrounds, they later experienced spiritual conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Personal Testimony
Sara Shiva (the presenter) shared her [[exploration_of_personal_and_collective_spirituality | personal spiritual exploration]] and conversion experience, which directly impacted her relationship with music.

### Early Life and Conversion
Born into an "esoteric mystic" family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>, Sara initially did not believe in the devil, viewing God as an energy and all paths as leading to Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. Her perspective drastically changed after a supernatural encounter during which she saw a demon affecting a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. This event led her to seek answers from God directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. After daily prayer and an intense, personal experience with God, she understood the truth about Him and the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

### Abandoning Secular Music
Sara, along with her sisters, formed a successful secular music band called SNZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. However, as her conversion process deepened, she no longer desired to sing entertainment music, wanting instead to sing praise music that frees and transforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. She continued working in her band for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. A specific show where she discerned demons dancing among the audience members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, solidified her conviction that secular shows are "cults in disguise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.

A profound vision during which she saw the heavenly orchestra, the devil's fall, and his intent to steal worship through music further confirmed her calling to separate from secular music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. She subsequently made a covenant with God to never again sing or dance to secular music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. Shortly after, her band was dismissed from their record label due to industry changes, which she saw as God freeing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

## The Two Pillars of Invocation: Arts and Sexuality
The two main pillars of invocation on Earth are identified as arts (especially music) and sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **Arts:** This includes music, which directly impacts the soul and can release either positive or negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>.
*   **Sexuality:** God uses sexual metaphors in the Bible to describe worship contrary to Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

Both these areas are highly targeted by the devil because they are linked to worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. God is tolerant of many things, but not of worship directed towards anything other than Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. Refraining from profane arts and illicit sexuality is a core principle for those seeking a life of [[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | holiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

## Holiness and Spiritual Protection
Holiness in one's private life is the primary source of spiritual protection; it is not merely being "used by God" or having anointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. The devil fears holiness because it represents direct opposition to his influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>. This belief has informed Sara Shiva's ministry, which focuses on sanctification and liberation, especially concerning the sexual and arts areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>.

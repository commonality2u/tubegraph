The [[Conflict in Israel and Palestine | conflict between Israel and Palestine]] is a complex and deeply rooted issue with diverse international perspectives on its historical context, current state, and potential solutions. Debaters offer different interpretations of its origins, the role of key actors, and the path forward.

## Historical Context and Interpretations

Thiago Ávila, an internationalist and socio-environmentalist who has visited the region, argues that the [[Conflict in Israel and Palestine | conflict]] is not religious, but rather a result of British imperialism [06:06:00]. He asserts that it is a massacre, not a war, spanning 75 years of a historical stage [05:54:00]. The process began with British imperialism in the late 19th century, promoting a "divide and conquer" strategy [06:16:00]. Zionist migration to Palestine intensified after the first Zionist Congress in 1897, a geopolitical decision based on location and natural resources like oil [06:32:00]. Before this migration, Historical Palestine was home to Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populations, with 10% Christian and 3% Jewish inhabitants, who coexisted [06:58:00]. This migration was seen as unfair, subsidized by international bodies and figures like Baron Rothschild, leading to the expulsion of the native population [07:15:00].

Ávila states that the Balfour Declaration, a letter promising a home for the Jewish people, disregarded the existing Palestinian national state and the indigenous people living there [09:06:00]. Zionist militias, formed over decades, allied with the British Empire to fight against the Palestinian people between 1936 and 1939 [10:01:00]. After World War II, the horrors of the Holocaust increased pressure for a Jewish state [10:38:00]. As the British Empire weakened, Zionist militias launched attacks, including the King David Hotel bombing, prompting the British to hand the issue to the UN [11:32:00]. The UN's Resolution 181, the partition plan, allotted the larger, more fertile, and coastal parts of the land to Israel, while the Palestinian territory became a "patchwork quilt" [12:04:00]. When the British Mandate ended, Israel declared its creation, but no Palestinian state was declared [12:51:00]. This led to what Arabs call "al-Nakba," the great tragedy, involving the expulsion of 750,000 Arab families and the destruction of 520 villages [13:00:00].

André, a PhD student in political science specializing in the [[Conflict in Israel and Palestine | Palestinian-Israeli conflict]], offers a different historical interpretation. He argues that Zionism, as a movement for the national self-determination of the Jewish people, predates 1897, with Jews wishing to return to their ancestral land for over 2,000 years [34:49:00]. He emphasizes that Zionism is not racist, and there are various forms of Zionism [35:57:00]. He points out that Jewish people established cities and communities and purchased land in the region before the turn of the 20th century [46:29:00]. He also highlights that Arab immigration to the coast of Palestine occurred from 1850 to 1920, driven by development around ports like Haifa and Jaffa [39:14:00].

André disputes the claim of oil resources in the region, stating that only gas was recently discovered [37:51:00]. He acknowledges that historical decisions by England and France regarding divisions of territories were "mistaken" by today's standards, but they were the rule at the time [38:08:00]. He cites the Peel Commission of 1937, which offered two states (Jewish and Arab), but the Arab Mufti of Jerusalem rejected it for economic reasons [47:54:00]. André states that the Arab League rejected UN Resolution 181, preventing the formation of a Palestinian state in 1947 [48:55:00]. He quotes Arab leaders who called for war and the expulsion of Jews into the sea, framing this as a religious conflict for some, notably [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] [49:52:00].

## The Role of [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] and Terrorism

Thiago Ávila condemns the civilian suffering on October 7th and believes it should "never be supported" [19:18:00]. However, he contextualizes [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]]'s emergence in 1987 as a result of the First Intifada and a desperate attempt by the Palestinian people to fight for liberation after unsuccessful agreements [19:46:00]. He states that [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]]'s methods, while leading to civilian suffering, must be condemned, but the organization is used by Israel as an excuse for its actions [23:45:00]. Ávila argues that if [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] didn't exist, other organizations would be labeled as terrorists, just as the PLO was before it [1:10:06]. He refers to state terrorism committed by Israel and the United States, citing bombings of hospitals and military checkpoints [1:28:10].

André vehemently condemns [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]]'s actions on October 7th as terrorism, akin to those of ISIS or Al-Qaeda [33:13:00]. He stresses that targeting civilians is not resistance [32:23:00]. He highlights that many Israeli civilians killed were left-wing, liberal, or socialist, living in kibbutzim and actively seeking coexistence with Palestinians [31:00:00]. He points out that [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]]'s charter explicitly states its fight against Jews is eternal and aims to obliterate Israel [51:18:00]. André argues that the blockade on Gaza, which began in 2007, is a consequence of [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] winning elections and refusing to recognize past agreements or Israel's right to exist [2:10:47]. He cites cases of [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] stealing resources like water pipes to build rockets [2:17:29]. André states that the current actions by [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | Hamas]] hinder peace by making the Israeli population more intransigent [59:00:00].

## Allegations of [[Human rights and apartheid allegations in Israel | Apartheid]] and Genocide

Thiago Ávila asserts that Israel operates under a regime of "colonization and apartheid," a classification supported by UN reports, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch [19:35:00]. He states that the International Criminal Court considers Israel a criminal state internationally [1:29:08]. He calls the current events in Gaza a "true genocide," citing the bombing of a hospital resulting in over 500 deaths, and a total of 2,838 deaths, including UN workers, paramedics, and journalists [1:13:00]. Ávila argues that Israel's actions, such as the construction of the 700km wall (85% within occupied territory), the establishment of military checkpoints resembling "slaughterhouses," and the concreting of water sources, are violations of international law [2:27:00]. He further highlights forced displacements, restrictions on movement, and the high unemployment and poverty rates in Gaza as evidence of this oppressive regime [2:41:00]. He claims Israel practices a "demographic war" to prevent Palestinian majorities in any region, leading to forced evictions [2:40:07].

André refutes the claims of [[Human rights and apartheid allegations in Israel | apartheid]] and genocide. He points out that 2 million Arabs live in Israel, serve in the army, hold positions in parliament (13 members), direct hospitals, and serve as police officers, indicating no racial segregation [1:01:28]. He asserts that the security barrier, 90% fence and 10% concrete, was built to prevent suicide bombers from entering Israel, not to enforce apartheid [59:22:00]. He claims that Israel's Supreme Court has changed the barrier's route 65 times to minimize harm to Palestinians [1:00:24]. André states that Palestinian population has grown, with 4.5 million in West Bank and Gaza today compared to 1 million in 1967, and 2 million Israeli Arabs compared to 300,000 in 1948, disproving genocide or ethnic cleansing by numbers [1:52:51]. He highlights Israel's efforts in building hospitals and sanitation in Gaza after occupying it from Egypt in 1967, contrasting it with Egypt's 19-year military dictatorship over Gaza [2:02:27].

## Paths to Peace and Coexistence

Thiago Ávila believes that for a peace proposal to be real, Israel must withdraw to the 1967 borders unconditionally [3:01:38]. He suggests considering a "plurinational state solution" where all peoples coexist peacefully, similar to historical Palestine, or as practiced in Ecuador and Bolivia [1:47:13]. He emphasizes that peace requires an end to the "genocide" and "military occupation" and the "decolonization" of the region from a racist and colonial ideology [3:01:07]. He calls for a major UN peacekeeping mission, citing its success in 1956 in the Sinai [3:02:24].

André stresses the need for pragmatism and for both sides to accept "some level of injustice" to achieve a solution [37:34:00]. He believes a two-state solution, with both an Israeli and Palestinian national state, is the only pragmatic way forward [37:32:00]. He rejects the idea of a binational state, stating that neither Palestinians nor Israelis want it, and historical examples have failed [1:10:09]. André advocates for normalization and coexistence between peoples, citing Israel's peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan [2:00:47]. He argues that increased relations between Israel and Arab states, such as Saudi Arabia, would provide more leverage for Arab countries to pressure Israel into a deal with Palestinians [2:08:07].

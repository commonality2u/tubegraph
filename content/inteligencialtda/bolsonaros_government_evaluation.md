The evaluation of [[Jair Bolsonaros presidency | Jair Bolsonaro's presidency]] and government policies has been a subject of intense debate, often focusing on [[brazils_economic_strategies_and_challenges | economic strategies and challenges]], social issues, and political conduct.

## General Outlook on Brazil

One perspective holds that a conservative, by nature, is skeptical and must do the right thing without expecting immediate success [0:07:03]. It is asserted that one cannot be pessimistic or "root against" Brazil [0:07:17]. The hope is that Brazil can restructure after the pandemic, which significantly impacted the economy [0:08:07].

A different view suggests that the everyday life of Brazilians reflects a struggling economy, with high gasoline prices and other challenges [0:09:23].

## Economic Performance and Policies

*   Bolsonaro is accused of doing "everything" to go against his own Ministry of Health's measures [0:38:33, 0:48:36].

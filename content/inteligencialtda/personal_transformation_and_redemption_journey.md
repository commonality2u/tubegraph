Frank, a former member of the PCC (First Capital Command), recounts his journey of [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | personal transformation]] and redemption after leaving organized crime. His narrative highlights the risks he faces daily and his unwavering commitment to warning young people about the true nature of criminal life.

## Frank's Background and Involvement with the PCC

Frank joined the PCC in 2016 and remained a member until 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. He describes his childhood as financially difficult, despite having honest and hardworking parents—his father was a driver and his mother a housewife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. He admits that his involvement in crime stemmed from a "lack of shame" and a desire to take a "shortcut" to easy money, seeing drug dealers with cars and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. He became involved in crime at 15, starting with robberies, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in Febem for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Spiritual Awakening in Febem

During his time in Febem, Frank had a pivotal [[transformation_and_conversion_experience | spiritual conversion]]. He encountered the Bible and learned about Jesus Christ, something he hadn't experienced in his Candomblé and Catholic upbringing, where evangelicals were often mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. He attributes his survival today to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>, stating that "God in my life" is the primary reason he is still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.

A notable event during his time as a minor was when his mother, frustrated by his criminal behavior, explicitly asked a judge to keep him imprisoned, telling the judge to "lock him up and throw the key out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. While initially feeling his mother didn't love him, he later understood it as a form of tough love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

## Departure from PCC and Life as a "Decreed" Individual

Frank decided to leave the PCC because he wanted to work and spend more time with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. He submitted a formal request to the command to leave crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. However, he was "decreed" and "excluded" from the PCC, meaning any criminal in the State of São Paulo is authorized to take his life without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This decree came after he spoke about a "maneuver" the PCC made regarding member payments, essentially converting a monthly fee into an obligation to purchase 1 kg of cocaine from the faction at a cost of R$12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

Since his exclusion, Frank has been on the run, moving from city to city and country to country within South America for almost nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. He constantly receives threats, including videos of people being tortured and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. He uses IP camouflage and VPNs and does not stay in one house for more than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>. He relies solely on his followers and God for support, lamenting the lack of government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>.

## Mission of Redemption and Public Advocacy

Frank's YouTube channel is his primary platform, where he *reports* criminals and exposes the reality of organized crime, especially the PCC's oppression of workers in communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>. He emphasizes that his goal is to "redeem my soul" and set an example for his children and mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">[01:40:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. He regrets his past actions, particularly hitting people and breaking bones, but states he never took a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:43">[03:33:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:55">[03:33:55]</a>.

He strongly advocates for a more stringent penal system, coining the phrase "leather and work" for prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. He argues against the "humanization" of prisoners and believes they should be forced to work to compensate the state and experience suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. Instead, he calls for the "humanization" of favelas and communities by improving infrastructure and police access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:25">[02:04:25]</a>.

Frank believes that crime should be ridiculed and that its romanticization by media, music, and influencers is harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:02">[03:10:02]</a>. He criticizes narratives that portray criminals as victims of society, citing the series "Sintonia" as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

Despite being a "dead man walking" in the eyes of the criminal world, Frank continues his mission, speaking truths that "no one has the courage to speak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:53">[02:14:53]</a>. He faces challenges including blocked bank accounts and threats, but remains steadfast in his commitment to expose the reality of crime and aid in the [[christianity_and_redemption | redemption]] of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:23">[02:33:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:54">[02:34:54]</a>. He struggles to find a place in society as a former criminal, noting that there is no support system for those who wish to leave crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:23">[02:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>. Frank’s story is a testament to [[personal_transformation_and_faith | personal transformation and faith]] and the ongoing battle against organized crime in Brazil.

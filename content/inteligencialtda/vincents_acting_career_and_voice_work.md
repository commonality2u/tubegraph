Vincent Martella's career in entertainment spans acting and voice work, with his breakout role as Greg Wuliger in *Everybody Hates Chris* gaining him significant recognition, particularly in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Early Life and Career Beginnings
Vincent Martella grew up in Florida on the West Coast of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> and has three brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. He began acting at a young age, around 10 or 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. His initial steps into the industry involved commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, which led to auditions for television series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. His parents were very supportive of his acting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

Martella emphasized that being on TV made his childhood different, but he saw it as a benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Unlike many child actors, he returned to public school in Florida when not filming, which he believes helped him stay grounded and surrounded by people in a "very normal way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. His experience working on *Everybody Hates Chris* solidified his decision to pursue entertainment for the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Breakthrough Role: *Everybody Hates Chris*
Martella auditioned for *Everybody Hates Chris*, a process that involved four or five auditions over almost two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. He filmed the pilot episode when he was 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, and the first season began filming when he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. The series was a consistent job, lasting four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

He noted that the cast, including himself and Tyler James Williams, grew up together on set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. They had the valuable opportunity to learn from experienced actors like Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Martella also spent a lot of time with the writers, especially in later seasons, to understand the show's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

The filming schedule adapted because of the child actors; initially filming from July to January, it shifted to April to September to reduce school interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. The series concluded when Martella was 17 and a half, almost 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Popularity in Brazil
Martella knew *Everybody Hates Chris* was popular in Brazil due to many social media comments in Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He believes its success in Brazil stems from several factors:
*   **Politically incorrect humor:** Brazilians appreciate this type of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Relatable reality:** The show's portrayal of economic hardship and family dynamics, such as fathers working multiple jobs, resonated with many Brazilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **Structural racism:** The satirical portrayal of racism in the 1960s was relatable, reflecting similar issues in Brazil and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Interracial friendship:** The friendship between Chris and Greg, navigating racial dynamics, was also a relatable element for audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
*   **Excellent dubbing:** The quality of the Portuguese dubbing, particularly the voice actor for Greg, was highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

Martella also commented on the internet memes and phrases that emerged from the show, like "she's so into you," which became a common Brazilian expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. He was surprised by how specific Brazilian fans' references could be, often requiring him to rewatch episodes to understand the jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

## Voice Acting and Other Roles
While working on *Everybody Hates Chris*, Martella also began his career as a voice actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. He has since worked on many cartoons and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, considering himself very lucky to work consistently on projects he enjoys and with people he loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

His voice work includes:
*   **Phineas and Ferb:** He voices Phineas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. He started working on the show in 2006, but it didn't premiere until 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>, highlighting the long animation process.
*   **DC Movies:** He has voiced Robin and Red Hood in some DC movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.
*   **The Walking Dead:** He appeared in three episodes of *The Walking Dead*, which was the most popular series in the U.S. at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. He auditioned for the role and was hired despite being late for his audition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

Martella currently works on three cartoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:08">[02:10:08]</a>. He often records alone in a studio for voice work, developing the skill to make conversations seem natural even without other actors present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03">[01:47:03]</a>. He values directors who provide guidance during auditions, indicating they believe in his ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>. He also enjoys improvising in comedy roles but notes that animation often has tighter scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Philosophy
Vincent Martella openly discusses the challenges of his [[comedy_careers_and_personal_stories | comedy careers and personal stories]], particularly dealing with rejection in the entertainment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. He has grown accustomed to it, but it remains a difficult part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. He advises younger actors only to pursue acting if they truly love it and are passionate about it, as success is hard to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Martella expresses deep gratitude for his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:15">[01:46:15]</a>. He feels fortunate that his work has meant so much to people, especially as generations watch the shows he's been in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. The connection he forms with fans, knowing his work has impacted their lives, is an "incredible feeling" he values greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. He hopes to continue creating entertainment that resonates with people in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

### Future Aspirations
Martella is interested in exploring more live performances, particularly sketch comedy, potentially creating his own sketch show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. He cites influences like David Chappelle and Saturday Night Live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. He also expressed interest in acting in horror (already done in *The Walking Dead*), Westerns, or fantasy genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. Beyond work, he hopes to visit Italy, where his family has roots, and learn fluent Italian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Martella has plans to return to Brazil for Imagine Land in July, an event near the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He looks forward to meeting many fans directly at the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, as this allows for more in-depth conversations and photo opportunities compared to chance encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

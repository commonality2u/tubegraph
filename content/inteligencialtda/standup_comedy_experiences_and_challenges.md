Standup comedy presents unique [[challenges_and_experiences_in_standup_comedy|experiences and challenges]] for performers.

## Early Shows and Audience Engagement

Early experiences in standup can be unpredictable. One of the first solo standup shows took place in Bragan√ßa Paulista, drawing around 800 people despite the performer not being widely known at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This specific show generated significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

However, low attendance is a common challenge. One show at the Santa Agostinho Theater had only 34 people in a 500-seat venue, which was described as a "defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Conversely, a show in Curitiba during Carnival, which they insisted on opening, ended up filling the venue with people even outside, and everyone, including [[collaborating_with_other_comedians|Jansen]], rolled up on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This success was followed by another disappointment at a theater in Plaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Evolution and Personal Stories in Comedy

The [[evolution_of_comedy_through_personal_stories|evolution of comedy through personal stories]] has become increasingly important. When performing standup, it's crucial to use lived experiences, as audiences can feel the truth in such stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. Performing material that isn't truthful or hasn't been personally experienced can be bothersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:11">[02:03:11]</a>.

The speaker notes that having a daughter has brought an abundance of material for standup, from school accounts to everyday occurrences, providing about 40 minutes of strong, relatable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>.

### The Role of Truth and Authenticity

Some artists gain popularity from short, viral content online, but their live shows may lack substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:53">[02:03:53]</a>. It's perceived that a "meme" won't translate into a full, engaging performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:06">[02:04:06]</a>. Audiences expect new content constantly, leading to a drop in quality unless the performer is exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a>.

## Adapting to Different Media

Transitioning from radio to standup and television presented an adaptation challenge, as humor differs across these mediums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. Dedication was key; the speaker dedicated three to three and a half years to standup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>.

The speaker's style in radio involved interacting with the public and making listeners the protagonists, drawing inspiration from daily life, including experiences on public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:11">[01:59:11]</a>. Maintaining a focus on radio as a profession was constant, even when working in television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>.

## Physical and Mental Toll of Performance

The demands of the profession can lead to health issues. The speaker experienced panic syndrome and burnout due to combining radio, television, and standup shows, especially those extending into the early morning hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>. This exhaustion led to a decision to reduce standup engagements, focusing only on Saturdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

The constant public exposure also brings challenges, such as being recognized and approached in public places, making simple activities like riding a train difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>.

## Competition and Online Content

The internet has significantly impacted the sense of competition in comedy. Some individuals cut and re-upload content from others, believing they have the right to monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:48">[03:56:48]</a>. This practice, combined with a lack of proper setup in short-form content (like TikTok), can create a false impression of comedic talent, leading to disappointment in live shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>.

The trend of "militancy" or delivering political speeches on stage without humor is also noted as unengaging for audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Personal Sacrifices

Being a comedian, especially one that travels frequently, means losing out on significant moments in a child's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:53">[03:38:53]</a>. This realization led to a decision to prioritize family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:56">[03:46:56]</a>.

## Early Life and Entry into Radio

Initially, [[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]] pursued an academic path, studying biology in college with an initial interest in veterinary medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. His entry into the entertainment world was unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

He started at Transamérica radio in a promotional role, distributing stickers and prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. After working for a year without pay, he was officially hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, eventually staying with Transamérica for 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. His radio career continued with promotional work at Rádio Cidade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a> and later at Jovem Pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

## Rise with Pânico

[[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]]'s involvement with Pânico began at Jovem Pan, where the show was already established with members like Emílio Surita and Billy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. His first on-air appearance was an interview about marijuana legalization, where he "said nonsense" that made people laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. This impromptu performance led to him becoming a regular contributor, eventually transitioning from promotional duties to full-time participation in Pânico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. The show's success grew, expanding to the Jovem Pan network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a> and later welcoming new members like Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a> and Carioca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

### Humor and Creative Process
Pânico's humor was characterized by its spontaneous, joking-around nature among friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, fostering a sense of camaraderie that viewers wanted to be a part of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The show often featured lighthearted mockery and absurd scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Out of Context Humor
> [[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]] notes that Pânico's humor, when taken out of context, could seem absurd, but within the show, everyone was laughing, indicating its internal logic and comedic timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Transition to Television

[[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]]'s first foray into television was with Luciano Huck's "Caldeirão" show, where he and Emílio created segments for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This experience, which provided better financial compensation, helped prepare him for the eventual transition of Pânico to TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

When Pânico launched on TV, the initial budget was so limited that they had to buy their own camera for filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>, and the first year yielded no earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. The show, however, achieved massive success, even occasionally outperforming major networks like Globo in audience ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Iconic Segments and Stunts
[[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]] was involved in many memorable segments:

*   **"Five Ways" (Cinco Maneiras):** A recurring segment where they would demonstrate various absurd "ways" to do something, such as giving a birthday gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> or getting a tattoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Challenges and Pressures

The high stakes of television, particularly the constant demand for audience ratings (IBOPE), brought significant pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

[[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Marcos Chiesa]] acknowledges that some stunts pushed boundaries and carried real risks, such as the cockroach stunt that caused concern from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

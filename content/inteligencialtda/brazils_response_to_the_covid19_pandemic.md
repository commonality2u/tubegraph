Brazil's response to the [[COVID19 pandemic management in Brazil | COVID-19 pandemic]] has been a subject of intense debate, marked by significant economic impacts, public health policy controversies, and political disagreements.

## Economic and Social Impact
The pandemic "got in the way in the first year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:34">[07:28:34]</a>, leading to widespread economic destruction. In Belo Horizonte alone, "more than 100,000 jobs" were destroyed due to the "stay at home campaign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:04">[08:10:04]</a>. The immediate challenge following this period was to "resume this entire economic spectrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Beyond the economic sphere, there was also a concern for the "moral sphere" of Brazil, which was seen to have "declined... in these past governments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

Despite the challenges, some economic indicators were cited as positive, such as Brazil breaking the "record of trade balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:07">[07:31:07]</a>. The Brazilian trade balance advanced by 69.7% in April 2021 compared to the previous month, with a positive balance of 10.35 billion, the largest since 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. In April 2021, the government closed 31 auctions, resulting in 54 billion in investments and 26.5 billion in authoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>. In March 2021, even with the second wave of COVID-19, 60,000 jobs were created, and the accumulated balance for 2021 was over 1.5 million jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Brazil's GDP in 2020 retracted only 4.1%, performing better than forecasts of a 10% drop, and had "one of the best results" among the world's largest economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. The emergency aid benefited 64 million Brazilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>, and the employment protection program preserved over 12 million jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

However, critics argued that Brazil's economy experienced a "recession" with the "worst level of investment," and its currency was "the most devalued in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. Brazil's inflation was cited as the "second biggest in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. The *Pronamp* credit program, designed to lend money to small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic, managed to put only 5% of available credit to these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

## Public Health Policies and Controversies
The [[Discussions on government policies and economic impacts in Brazil | Bolsonaro government]] faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic.

### Vaccination
A key point of contention was vaccination. President Bolsonaro signed Law 13,979, which allows for "compulsory realization" of measures like "vaccination" and "other prophylactic measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>, giving powers to governors and mayors to "compulsorily vaccinate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. This law is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. Despite this, Brazil ranked 60th globally in terms of vaccinated individuals per 100 inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. The government "did not buy the vaccines" when offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a> and a commitment to purchase 20 million doses of the Covaxin vaccine for 1.6 billion reais was only broken after the CPI on COVID-19 began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. Brazil has distributed over 184 million vaccine doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

### Treatments and Other Measures
There was strong support from some figures for treatments like chloroquine and ivermectin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>, and nebulization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. The departure of Health Minister Nelson Teich was linked to his disagreement with Bolsonaro's support for chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Teich had proposed an "intelligent isolation" plan based on understanding which municipalities and health systems would collapse, which was considered "one of the most advanced in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>, but he was dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

Bolsonaro was said to have done "everything during this pandemic to go against the measures of your own Ministry of Health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. The federal government's autonomy was withdrawn, shifting responsibility to mayors and governors for implementing measures like lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, leading to people being arrested for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. Bolsonaro was criticized for not supporting a complete lockdown, stating that "unemployment too hunger too even more people will die of hunger than coronavirus in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Governance
The political response to the pandemic also revealed tensions within [[Brazilian politics and governance | Brazil's political landscape]].
*   **Decentralization of Power:** While the federal government had a stance, the effective command over pandemic measures like lockdowns and business closures lay with "governors and the mayors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Impeachment Attempts:** There were attempts to impeach the Bolsonaro government early in the pandemic, with the OAB requesting "inoperability of Bolsonaro government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a> just weeks after the first death in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Criticism of Bolsonaro's Leadership:** Bolsonaro was accused of "not buying the vaccines" when offered, increasing his own salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>, and presiding over a country with "the worst level of investment" since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. It was suggested he "abandoned the agenda" he had in respect for nations of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. He was also criticized for increasing taxes through tax reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, and for his "administrative reform" being "lousy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
*   **President's Prerogatives and Alliances:** Bolsonaro's government was described as "imperfect, just like any human creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. His shift towards working with the *Centr√£o* was seen as a necessity for "governability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>, even if it meant allying with figures previously criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:09">[01:53:09]</a>.

Sarah Sheeva's theological beliefs and teachings are deeply rooted in her personal [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | conversion]] experience and her subsequent study and interpretation of the Bible. She emphasizes a radical approach to [[Christianity Selfesteem and Healing Messages | holiness]], particularly concerning arts, sexuality, and relationships.

## Personal Relationship with God
Sheeva describes her relationship with God as an exchange of ideas rather than formal prayer, stating, "I do not pray to God, I exchange ideas God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This perspective was influenced by her upbringing, where she was never repressed and always encouraged to choose her own path, leading her to feel no "resistance with the no of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. She believes that people who project a repressive father figure onto God often struggle with this resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Her [[faith_spirituality_and_the_existence_of_God | faith]] in God's intervention is exemplified by a story where she prayed for her car to become "invisible" to potential robbers in a dangerous area, which resulted in a car accident instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. She interprets this as God's will, even if the outcome was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Worldview and Spiritual Warfare
Sheeva holds a firm belief that "the world is a tough place... lies in the evil one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. She teaches that humanity cannot make the world a better place because it has been "decomposing since the fall of man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> and that "evil exists" in all governments and eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Believers can be "resistance against evil" but lack the power to fundamentally change the world's decomposing state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Her ministry frequently encounters spiritual warfare, including physical attacks and infiltration by Satanists within churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>. She attributes her protection not to anointing, but to [[Christianity Selfesteem and Healing Messages | holiness]] in one's private life, as "the devil is not afraid of anyone being used otherwise he would not enter the church... what the devil is afraid of is holiness in your private life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:47">[02:26:47]</a>.

## Theology of Sound and Arts
Sheeva holds a specialized [[understanding_of_scripture_and_its_teachings | theology of sound]], teaching that "all things were created by the sound that came out of the mouth of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This makes sound the "mother of the Arts" and a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

A core teaching is that "it doesn't exist neutral music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, as all music is inspired "either from heaven to hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This belief stems from her understanding of Lucifer's role as the "chief of the music of heaven" before his fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, and that God did not take away his power to make music after he fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Therefore, profane arts are tools of the devil, intended to "steal worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a> and lead to violence and sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>.

She argues that music affects the "brain MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, stirring desires and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This belief led her to abandon her secular music career, as Jesus revealed to her that "every show is a cult in disguise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a> where someone (often not God) is being worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. She advocates for radical consumption of media, including films and music, by praying in tongues to "shield" oneself from negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:13">[05:21:13]</a>.

## Sexuality and Marriage
Sheeva teaches that sexuality and arts are the "two pillars of invocation on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. For God, sexuality must be "within your marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a> and arts must be "for God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a>. She considers sexual sin and sin with the arts harder to repent from due to the pleasure involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>.

She advocates for a very strict approach to relationships and marriage:
*   **Abstinence before marriage:** She has maintained [[Catholic beliefs and practices | sexual abstinence]] for over 22 years because "sex is exclusive to marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.
*   **Marriage steps:** For a couple to be married "before God and before the law of Men," three steps are necessary: 1. Legalizing the union before human law, 2. Receiving a priestly blessing, 3. Consummating the marriage through sexual conjunction (honeymoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Skipping steps, especially having sex before legal and spiritual blessing, is considered "sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.
*   **Dating practices:** She advises dating for a year without kissing, focusing on friendship and understanding character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>. Kissing before marriage instigates desire "that is not time still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>. She tests potential partners by removing their hand if they touch her, to see if they respect boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.
*   **Friendship as foundation:** She stresses that marriage should be between best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. Women need to admire their partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>, and men must lead with integrity.
*   **Marital intimacy:** She teaches that couples must prioritize "kissing on the mouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:27">[02:17:27]</a> as the "flame of marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> and sex, encouraging intimacy outside the home to avoid "mediocre sexual life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.
*   **Spiritual transfer in sex:** She teaches that sexual intercourse involves a "transfer of spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:12">[02:58:12]</a>. If both partners are filled with the Holy Spirit, it's a communion of the Spirit. However, if one or both are not in obedience, demons have a "right to enter" the union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:47">[02:58:47]</a>.

## The Nature of the Spirit and Human Being
Sheeva describes humans as originally "spirit soul and body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a> with a direct connection between the spirit, soul (mind), and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. After Adam and Eve sinned, God "cut the link that connected us to our spirit with our soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>, resulting in a "dead spirit" at birth for all humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

Being "born again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a> refers to the Holy Spirit reconnecting with the spirit, leading to emotional and physical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. While the spirit is instantly healed and transformed upon conversion, the soul and body undergo a "daily process" of healing and sanctification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.

She also teaches on "sleep paralysis" as a temporary "discord between your body and your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>, where the "eye of the Soul" opens to perceive the spiritual dimension that God normally keeps hidden for human survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. She contrasts this with "astral projection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a> where a demon creates a "forbidden bridge" for conscious spiritual travel, classifying it as "witchcraft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

## Other [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | Spiritual Teachings and Beliefs]]
*   **The Devil:** While some deny the literal existence of the devil, Sheeva asserts his reality, seeing him as synonymous with Satan, whose existence is evidenced in [[understanding_of_scripture_and_its_teachings | scripture]] like the book of Job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.
*   **Gluttony:** She defines gluttony not necessarily as being overweight, but as "binge eating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:26">[02:31:26]</a>, or eating with the soul/emotion rather than hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>. She considers it a form of idolatry that can lead to hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:46">[02:31:46]</a>.
*   **Church Practices:** She advocates for new converts to spend at least two years "just being served, just being trained, just learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:21">[02:46:21]</a> before serving, criticizing churches that put new believers into ministry too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:27">[02:46:27]</a>. She also emphasizes the importance of congregational worship to "counterattack all the opposite sound curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Future of the World:** She believes Jesus will return soon, stating, "I can't tell you that we are very close in my discernment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:45">[03:10:45]</a>, though no one knows the exact day or hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:49">[03:10:49]</a>. She expects society to continue deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:03">[02:57:03]</a> until God eventually "format[s] the earth" anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>.

Igor Guimarães's journey to [[Pnico na TV show and its impact | Pânico]] is detailed, including the creation of the famous Josias puppet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The show provided him with a platform to showcase his talents, including singing, dancing, and imitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Creation of the Josias Puppet

The Josias puppet was conceived when Morgado and writer Beth Moreno needed a new character for the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Igor was already performing characters and was asked to develop a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. He suggested creating a puppet, and when a doll was provided, he decided to embody it himself, even without makeup, claiming to be the doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This character became a hit due to its unique blend of dark humor, dealing with topics like cancer and organ theft, which stood out from the lighter humor prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

## Humor Style and Impact

Pânico, at its inception, featured a distinct type of humor that later evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Igor appreciates this style of humor, noting that it often involves sketch characters, and he believes there's still a demand for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. He doesn't hold prejudices against any form of humor, stating that if it makes him laugh, it's valid as art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. He also views criticism and hate as valuable, as they create a "repertoire" and confirm the importance of his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.

## Collaborations and Touring

Igor worked extensively with Lago, who was also part of Pânico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. They traveled across Brazil, performing shows and gaining significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. He expresses gratitude to Lago and his team for their support, noting that many people forget those who helped them succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. The experience of performing in difficult venues, such as Mogi in the USA or a challenging show near Poá, helped him learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

## Personal Revelations on Pânico

Igor also made a significant personal revelation on Pânico, a [[coming_out_experience_and_personal_revelations | coming out experience]] that he had previously only shared with his closest friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He felt comfortable sharing this on the show due to his familiarity with the audience and proximity to the host, Emílio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>. He later explained that he felt he was deceiving people by not being open about his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:29">[01:35:29]</a>. This public declaration was a moment of maturity and self-awareness, as he felt he was boycotting himself by remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>. The revelation did not cause the major negative repercussions he might have feared, indicating that public perception was more accepting than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>. He considers his openness a form of activism, promoting acceptance through coexistence and humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

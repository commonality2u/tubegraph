Emerson Ceará, a comedian from Brazil's Northeast, achieved success in Curitiba and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He considers himself a smart guy, particularly in specific subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Transition to Curitiba

Emerson Ceará began acting in theater during his school days, even writing small plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. This was done secretly from his father, who forbade theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>, believing it was "rough" and not for a "country guy" like himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. He even attempted a film role in "Into the Clouds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. At 14, he secretly attended casting calls and passed initial tests, but his father refused to sign the necessary authorization, ending his chance to participate in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

In 2006, at 18, he moved to Londrina, Paraná, under the false pretense of a job as a peddler, thinking Londrina was in Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. He soon realized his mistake and moved to Curitiba, where he worked as a bricklayer and later as a waiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>. His dream was to work a "decent job" as a waiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:20">[03:00:20]</a>. He secured a waiter position at a pizzeria by lying about his experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:41">[03:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:34">[03:26:34]</a>.

## Entering the Comedy Scene

While working at the pizzeria, Emerson met Ramos Neto, who was opening a comedy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. In March 2010, the comedy bar opened, and Emerson went for a waiter interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He ended up lying again, claiming to be a bartender, and quickly learned classic drinks online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

His first experience performing stand-up comedy was terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. He didn't have a structured joke and told a bad cat joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The bar owner encouraged him to try again, and his second attempt was better, lasting four minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. He eventually became the "Big Chef" at the bar, teaching new people and performing all tasks, including cleaning bathrooms and washing dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Evolution in Comedy

Emerson Ceará describes the early days of comedy as having cliques and an "ego issue" among comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. He often faced prejudice because he was a waiter doing comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Some established comedians would even try to sabotage his sets or deny him performance slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, he continued to build his material alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

A turning point came when a peer, Eduardo Jericó, advised him to stop relying on generic jokes and instead tell [[evolution_of_comedy_through_personal_stories|personal stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This advice was crucial for his [[evolution_of_comedy_through_personal_stories|comedic development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. His approach to comedy became more focused on drawing humor from his life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, which helped him connect with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## Rise to Prominence

Emerson Ceará's career saw significant growth through the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. He invested R$30,000 (money borrowed from German, a friend) into boosting his Facebook videos, which eventually led to viral success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. His videos accumulated hundreds of thousands of views, and within seven months, he paid back the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This success allowed him to open a YouTube channel in April 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

He even tried to get his wife into the event to see Sandy (of Sandy & Junior), but they were denied entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This experience fueled his feeling of being an outsider in the comedy scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Touring and Independent Path

Emerson Ceará prefers to travel and perform by bus due to a fear of planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of building his career independently, without relying on established "cliques" or groups in the comedy scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

> "You have to walk and God understood to depend on you just exactly, see if you have that you understand that you don't need to be in a pan, it's easier to get them, but you, you alone take time, it takes longer to taste better on the face, it's more pleasure." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>

He believes that a successful career can be built outside the traditional São Paulo-Rio axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He cites [[whindersson_nunes_comedy_career|Whindersson Nunes]] from Piauí as an example of a successful comedian who isn't separated from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Lowest Point and Mentorship

Emerson Ceará identifies his lowest career point as returning home feeling defeated, living with another comedian in Curitiba, and facing hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. He considered giving up and returning to his parents' house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. However, his friend encouraged him not to quit, reminding him how far he had come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

He highlights the importance of honesty and hard work in comedy. He mentions [[danilo_gentilis_personal_stories_and_influences_in_comedy|Danilo Gentili]] and others who started with humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. He also recalls how Eduardo Jericó helped him refine his material, pushing him to tell [[evolution_of_comedy_through_personal_stories|personal stories]] rather than generic jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

> "A lot of work... life of the opportunity to go to the very work you work and be honest. I understand, there is no one who will have no class, you are very bad, it will happen, good thing, man, you, if you hold on, hold on a little longer, you've come this far." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>

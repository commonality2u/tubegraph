## Personal Experiences with Israel
Rodrigo Silva has visited [[cultural_and_spiritual_experiences_in_traveling_to_israel | Israel]] approximately 40 times [00:07:42]. He noted that his initial visit for a podcast didn't include snacks, a detail humorously recalled by listeners [00:20:01].

The speaker narrowly avoided the recent conflict in [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | Israel]] [00:06:23]. He was scheduled to record a documentary but was unable to go due to work commitments related to finishing a museum [00:06:42]. A journalist, Ley Alves, went in his place; however, the team arrived on Friday afternoon, and the conflict began on Saturday morning, preventing them from recording any episodes before returning [00:06:53]. All Brazilians who wished to return from [[cultural_and_spiritual_experiences_in_traveling_to_israel | Israel]] were able to, except for those in the [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | Gaza Strip]] [00:07:13]. The Brazilian Ambassador to Palestine, Dr. Alessandro, is actively working to protect and evacuate Brazilians from the Gaza Strip, though their exit is more challenging than from [[cultural_and_spiritual_experiences_in_traveling_to_israel | Israel]] [00:07:23].

Silva has also been to Jordan and the Palestinian region of Shechem (Nablus) [00:07:48]. He recalls being in [[cultural_and_spiritual_experiences_in_traveling_to_israel | Israel]] during the 2006 war against Lebanon [00:08:02]. When the recent news of conflict broke, he initially thought it was "just another thing" that always happens, but realized the severity when Netanyahu decreed war [00:08:14]. He notes that the number of Israeli/Jewish deaths was the highest since the Holocaust [00:08:25]. Some observant Jews, who typically avoid cell phones on Shabbat, sent messages during this time due to the crisis [00:08:38].

A program discussed the conflict with a Brazilian survivor from a rave event who lost a friend and his sister's girlfriend, with the friend later confirmed dead [00:09:35]. Professor Ariel da Mori√° in [[cultural_and_spiritual_experiences_in_traveling_to_israel | Israel]] expressed deep emotional distress, stating he cries every day [00:10:04]. As of the recording, 220-222 people were confirmed kidnapped by Hamas, with some others still missing [00:10:28].

## Prophetic Interpretation of Current Events
Silva interprets current global conflicts, including those in the Middle East and Ukraine, as reflections of a "cosmic war between good and evil" that began at the dawn of humanity and will conclude with divine intervention [00:44:23]. He refers to Jesus's words in Luke Chapter 21, verses 26-28, which describe people fainting in terror due to future events, but also advise standing tall as redemption draws near [00:45:30].

He advises against being consumed by fear (phobia) but acknowledges that a certain degree of fear is prudent for self-protection [01:04:07]. He contrasts this with the "fear of the Lord," which is a positive reverence and appreciation for God, akin to a parent's concern for their child, rather than terror of punishment [01:09:06]. He criticizes the historical use of fear-based theology, such as Jonathan Edwards' sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" or the selling of indulgences [01:06:31].

Silva notes that the concept of an Antichrist is widely discussed, particularly regarding a global power. He contrasts the long-held Christian view that the Antichrist would emerge from within Christianity (apostasy) and unite with a dominant secular power (historically identified with Rome) [02:12:16]. He argues that this interpretation dates back to the early church fathers and was maintained through the Protestant Reformation [02:10:19].

He criticizes more recent interpretations, arising in the late 19th century, that link the Antichrist specifically to political entities like the Soviet Union or China, or suggest Israel as a focal point for end-times events [02:13:06]. He considers the idea that Jews would be "left behind" to suffer as anti-Semitic [02:14:57].

Silva highlights that the Apocalypse symbolically portrays the Antichrist as a parody of God, with the "mark of the beast" being a counterfeit of God's sign of faithfulness [02:25:44]. Drawing from Deuteronomy 6, where Jews were instructed to wear God's law on their foreheads and hands (tefillin), he suggests the mark of the beast is a spiritual sign opposing fidelity to God, rather than a literal tattoo or chip [02:29:46].

He asserts that the Antichrist, as described by John and Paul, must be someone who comes from within Christianity and apostatizes, not an external, non-Christian leader [02:03:46]. This entity will seek to unify the world and control trade, aligning with modern global systems where economic participation requires adherence to a system [02:23:14].

## Humanity's Historical and Prophetic Trajectory
Silva posits that humanity faces five "rebel children" that necessitate a single global governance for control:
1.  **Internet:** Uncontrolled, it poses dangers like pedophilia, cyberterrorism, and state secrets [03:04:56].
2.  **Ecology:** Global environmental issues require universal cooperation, as local destruction (e.g., Amazon deforestation) impacts the entire world [03:05:11].
3.  **Trafficking:** Drug, human, and arms trafficking operate globally, with more people enslaved today than during official slavery [03:05:55].
4.  **World Economy:** The speculative nature of global stock markets demonstrates a lack of centralized control, affecting everyone worldwide [03:06:53].
5.  **Artificial Intelligence:** This emerging technology poses unknown dangers and requires careful regulation [03:07:17].

He points to the global response to COVID-19, where people worldwide adopted universal measures like mask-wearing, as the first instance in history where the entire world stopped and accelerated together [03:02:49]. This, he suggests, foreshadows the kind of global control predicted in Revelation where no one can buy or sell without the mark of the beast [03:08:07].

Regarding the return of Jesus, Silva, as an Adventist, adheres to the principle of not setting specific dates, citing the historical mistake of William Miller in 1844 [02:59:50]. However, he emphasizes that like labor pains, which indicate a birth is coming without specifying the exact hour, current global events serve as "contractions" signaling the imminent return of Jesus [03:00:48].

## Archaeological and Biblical Insights
Silva discusses the four rivers of the Garden of Eden mentioned in Genesis 2: Pison, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates [02:59:21]. While the Tigris and Euphrates exist today in Mesopotamia, he suggests they are not the same rivers mentioned in Genesis due to the catastrophic changes brought by the global flood [03:11:32]. He believes these modern rivers were "re-baptized" by survivors of the flood, much like Brazilian cities were named after European ones [03:11:45].

He also touches on the location of the Garden of Eden, noting Jewish traditions that place it in Jerusalem and Muslim traditions that associate it with Mecca [03:32:00]. The region of Iraq, particularly the "fertile crescent," is recognized as the cradle of human civilization, where inventions like writing, the wheel, agriculture, mathematics, and ceramics originated [03:39:57]. He highlights how early humans genetically modified plants like onions and bananas to make them edible [03:54:40].

Silva addresses questions about the historical evidence for Jesus, noting that external sources like Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, and Flavius Josephus mention him [02:42:52]. He argues that there is more contemporary evidence for Jesus's existence than for historical figures like Alexander the Great or Pythagoras [02:43:18]. He points to the internal consistency of the Gospels, highlighting details like Mary Magdalene being the first witness to the resurrection (which would have been scandalous in that cultural context), suggesting the stories were not invented [02:40:23].

He contends that even if Jesus were a "myth," he remains the "best myth" due to the transformative power of his teachings on lives, citing examples of former drug addicts and criminals [02:44:41]. He challenges the idea that the Bible is on the same level as Marvel comics, asking why literary creators cannot achieve the same life-changing conversions as the Gospels [02:47:28].

The resurrection of Jesus is presented as the crucial element that differentiates him from other historical or mythical figures, making his story unique [02:48:04]. He references a logician, Maiman, who, using Aristotelian logic, calculated a very high mathematical probability (over 99%) that the resurrection was true, by systematically disproving alternative hypotheses [02:50:06].

## [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Role of Israel in Biblical History]]
Silva explains that [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | biblical history]] primarily focuses on the Middle East, funneling into the dynasty of Abraham, rather than being a universal encyclopedia [03:19:19]. God's choice of Abraham was an act of grace, not based on Abraham's merit, and his role was to be the father of the nation that would bring the Messiah to the world [03:40:29].

However, Silva emphasizes that God also worked through other people and nations outside of Abraham's lineage, citing examples like Melchizedek (king of Salem) and Jethro (Moses's father-in-law) [03:41:09]. This indicates that God has different functions for different people and can use even those who deny Him to achieve His purposes [03:43:01].

The New Testament, written in Greek, and the Roman organization of cities facilitated the spread of the Messiah's message beyond the Jewish people [03:44:42]. When Jesus was born, pagan Magi from the East were among the first to recognize him as King and Messiah [03:45:19].

Silva outlines three theological perspectives on the role of the Jewish people after Jesus's coming:
1.  **Replacement Theology:** God's plan for [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Israel]] ended with the New Testament, and the Church replaces the Jewish people [03:45:58].
2.  **Parenthetical Theology:** The Church is merely a parenthesis, and [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Israel]] remains the primary people of God, with God eventually restoring them [03:46:22].
3.  **Intermediate View (Silva's belief):** The Jewish people fulfilled their role by bringing the Messiah, but by rejecting him, they lost their primary relevance in delivering the message to the world [03:46:37]. Before Jesus, the world would seek truth from the Jews, but after their rejection, the message became centrifugal, spreading from Jerusalem to the world through Christian missionaries [03:47:58].

Despite this, Silva believes that God still has affection for [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Israel]], and many Jews will eventually accept Jesus as the Messiah [03:49:11]. He stresses the importance of Christians witnessing to Jews by showing that Jesus was Jewish and not anti-Semitic, counteracting the historical negative portrayal of Jesus by Christianity (e.g., persecutions like the Spanish Inquisition) [03:50:50].

He notes a current spiritual movement where many Jews and Muslims are recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, often through dreams and personal experiences, even while living in restrictive environments [03:50:02]. He concludes that God's people are broader than any single church, encompassing sincere individuals from all walks of life [03:50:30].

## Early Life and Entry into Comedy

Cris Paiva's path to comedy was unconventional. She initially pursued a career in teaching, not because she had a passion for it, but as a practical choice to ensure she could balance work with her desire to be a mother. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a> She studied Pedagogy and worked as a teacher for ten years, choosing it because it offered part-time work and allowed her to be present for her daughter, Mariana. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a> Her first presentation in comedy was in 2007. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:46">[02:42:46]</a> Despite her outspoken stage persona, Cris considers herself to be very shy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>

## Comedic Style and Themes

Cris Paiva's comedy is deeply personal, often focusing on her own life and relationships. She is well-known for making jokes about her ex-husband. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> After her separation, she developed a popular routine around the experience, which resonated with audiences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:57">[03:54:57]</a> She emphasized that finding the right tone for such a personal and initially painful topic was crucial to ensure the audience could laugh along with her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:52">[03:44:52]</a> Her comedic material also includes anecdotes about her daughter, Mariana, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a> and even her own physical appearance, such as her nose surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and a tooth gap she used to have. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>

She believes comedy should not be used for offense, but rather as a form of shared understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>

### Views on Gender in Comedy

Cris Paiva holds strong views on the role of women in comedy. She asserts that talent should be the sole criterion for success, rather than gender quotas or "pity" spaces. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a> She finds it irritating when less experienced female comedians are given opportunities merely to meet a quota, as she believes this ultimately harms the perception of women in comedy by showcasing raw talent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:34">[01:49:34]</a>

> "I'm not in favor of this fight not only Please, I think it's a fight useless because you are you are wanting space for pity is wanting space because you have a b***** and that was funny no I say it like that because woman is afraid of woman sitting on her ass in the hair write be good on stage that no one will care if the woman is a man you will be called and it's over be so good on stage that the guy who come in later and say c****** like what I'll get that audience back later because this girl did it with the glue, that's it, that's it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>

She feels that comedy has always been an inclusive environment, at least within the stand-up scene she experienced. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>

### Political Comedy

Cris also incorporates political commentary into her comedy, often aiming to criticize both sides of the political spectrum rather than aligning with one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a> She expresses disdain for radical "worshipers" on both the left and right, whom she believes are more interested in destroying the opposition than in solving problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> She argues that politicians should be seen as human beings, not heroes or devils, and that intellectual honesty is paramount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>

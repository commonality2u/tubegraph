This article summarizes a debate on the Big Bang theory and its relationship with cosmology, particularly in light of recent observational data from telescopes like Hubble and James Webb. Key arguments for and against the established cosmological model, as well as discussions on the age of the universe and Earth, are presented.

## The Big Bang Model
The Big Bang is described as a "model" for the universe, not a definitive reality [00:57:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>, [00:59:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>, [01:06:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>). It is considered "one of the hypotheses for explaining the beginning of the universe," with several others existing [01:11:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>). The standard Big Bang model (Lambda-CDM) does not claim the universe arose "from nothing" [01:00:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, [01:00:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, [03:03:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:34">[03:03:34]</a>). Instead, it posits an initial dense and compact state where everything already existed, and the model explains how this state evolved over time [01:00:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>, [01:00:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>).

The universe's estimated age according to the Big Bang model is currently around 13.77 billion years [02:52:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:04">[02:52:04]</a>).

## Challenges and Criticisms of the Big Bang Model
Several points of contention and criticisms of the Big Bang model were raised:
*   **Physical Laws at the Beginning**
    *   The initial singularity is described as a phenomenon "disconnected from physical laws" [00:49:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>).
    *   It is suggested that "the laws of physics are born within that singularity" [00:49:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>).
    *   It is argued that the Big Bang "starts with a miracle" due to a period of "strange and unknown laws of physics" [02:04:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:27">[02:04:27]</a>, [02:04:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:30">[02:04:30]</a>).

*   **Formation of Stars and Galaxies**
    *   The model struggles to explain how an expanding gas cloud could collapse into stars without additional phenomena [00:50:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>).
    *   It is argued that the model "uses stars to explain the birth of the first stars" [00:50:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>).
    *   The presence of cosmic dust, essential for star formation, is problematic as dust itself is formed in star explosions [00:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>, [00:50:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>).
    *   The model predicts very few galaxies with a redshift (z) greater than 10, but observed data indicates "100,000 times more" [02:27:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a>, [02:27:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:29">[02:27:29]</a>).
    *   The presence of highly massive [[Black Holes and Theoretical Physics | black holes]] at the early stages of the universe challenges the formation timeline [01:14:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>, [02:44:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>, [02:45:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:05">[02:45:05]</a>).

*   **Chemical Elements and Metallicity**
    *   In the early universe, the model predicts "basically just hydrogen and helium" [01:32:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>, [01:32:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>).
    *   However, James Webb observations show galaxies from the early period already containing "metallic chemical elements" (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) like vanadium, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen [01:31:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>, [01:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, [01:32:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>, [01:46:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>).
    *   This metallicity contradicts the model, as these elements should form later through successive supernova explosions [01:28:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>, [01:28:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, [01:41:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>).

*   **Homogeneity and Inflation**
    *   The universe's observed homogeneous temperature is a problem for the model (the Horizon Problem) [00:50:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>, [00:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>).
    *   Inflation, a "mysterious force" that expands the universe faster than the speed of light, was proposed to solve this, but is seen as another "miracle of the Big Bang" [00:51:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, [00:51:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>, [00:51:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>, [02:16:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:27">[02:16:27]</a>).

*   **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**
    *   The model "appealed to the matter dark" to explain why mass collapses into itself, despite lacking a fundamental particle [00:50:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>, [00:50:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>).
    *   [[Cosmological theories and the concept of cosmic void | Dark energy]] is proposed to explain the accelerating expansion of galaxies [00:56:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>).
    *   These are viewed as "miracles" or "ad hoc" explanations [02:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, [02:37:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:36">[02:37:36]</a>, [03:02:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:26">[03:02:26]</a>, [03:02:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:30">[03:02:30]</a>).

*   **Antimatter Disappearance**
    *   The disappearance of half the universe's antimatter is identified as a "huge problem" for the model [02:26:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:54">[02:26:54]</a>, [02:27:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>).

*   **The "Dark Ages"**
    *   The universe's "Dark Ages" refers to a period after the cosmic microwave background (CMB) where no stars existed [01:32:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>, [01:52:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:21">[01:52:21]</a>, [01:54:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>).
    *   The observed maturity of early galaxies in JWST images suggests this period was "getting shorter" [01:57:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:22">[01:57:22]</a>).

*   **Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics**
    *   The second law of thermodynamics (entropy) suggests that the universe, if ancient, should be "totally worn out" or "aged" [01:33:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>, [02:04:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:57">[02:04:57]</a>, [02:06:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:06:20]</a>).
    *   It is claimed that applying thermodynamics equations to the Big Bang model "destroys the model" [03:06:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:37">[03:06:37]</a>, [03:06:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:42">[03:06:42]</a>, [03:06:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:53">[03:06:53]</a>).

## Observational Evidence and Debates
*   **Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Images**
    *   The HDF photo, showing "structured, formed galaxies, fully functional, solid, smooth," was seen as evidence that the universe "was made ready" [00:55:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>, [00:55:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>, [00:55:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>, [00:55:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>).
    *   It is argued that the initial selection of the HDF target area was not random but based on previous studies that suggested it would be a good region to observe distant galaxies [01:03:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>, [01:04:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>, [01:05:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, [01:06:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>).
    *   The JWST's early images initially led to claims of discovering increasingly distant galaxies, but spectroscopic analysis often reclassified them as "imposter galaxies" due to dust obscuration, indicating they were closer than initially estimated [01:10:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, [01:11:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>, [01:11:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>, [01:11:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>, [01:12:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>).
    *   The JWST's findings, particularly the presence of mature, metal-rich galaxies and supermassive [[Black Holes and Theoretical Physics | black holes]] early in the universe, are described as unexpected and challenging for 99% of current [[Cosmological theories and the concept of cosmic void | cosmological models]] [01:14:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>, [01:14:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>, [01:14:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>), [02:38:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:47">[02:38:47]</a>, [02:39:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>). These observations have led to calls for rewriting astronomy and cosmology books [01:14:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>, [01:14:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>).

*   **Galaxy Evolution**
    *   The model of galaxy evolution suggests that older, more massive galaxies are typically elliptical, while spiral galaxies are younger [02:17:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:31">[02:17:31]</a>, [02:17:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:37">[02:17:37]</a>, [02:18:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>).
    *   Observations of mature spiral galaxies (like the HD1 galaxy) with supermassive black holes near the universe's beginning challenge this expected evolutionary sequence [01:14:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>, [02:44:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, [02:44:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>).

## The Role of Models in Science
*   **Models vs. Reality**: A model is a "mental image" or a representation, not the reality itself [00:57:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>, [00:57:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>). If a model is "totally right," it ceases to be a model and becomes "reality" [01:53:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>, [01:53:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a>).
*   **Probabilistic Nature**: Models incorporate probability; they don't guarantee exact outcomes [00:58:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>, [00:58:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>, [01:02:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>).
*   **Adaptation vs. Falsification**: A central debate revolves around whether the Big Bang model is being genuinely falsified by new data or merely "adjusted" and "accommodated" to fit observations [01:15:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>, [01:15:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>, [01:46:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>, [01:59:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>).
    *   Critics argue that a "good scientific model" makes "good predictions" and should be falsifiable by data, rather than constantly updated [01:15:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>, [01:15:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>, [01:15:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>, [03:03:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:11">[03:03:11]</a>).
    *   Proponents argue that updating models with new data (like in oil reservoir modeling) is a normal and "beautiful" part of science [01:59:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>, [02:00:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:15">[02:00:15]</a>).
    *   A model is falsifiable if, for example, its predictions (like the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature) are not observed, or if fundamental principles (like the universe's isotropy) are definitively broken [02:17:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>, [02:21:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>, [02:23:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>).

*   **Technological Limitations and [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | Observational Astronomy]]**: [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | Astronomy]] is an observational science, dependent on technology [02:00:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:44">[02:00:44]</a>, [02:00:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:47">[02:00:47]</a>). The ability to see further or detect specific phenomena is limited by current telescope capabilities [01:47:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:44">[01:47:44]</a>, [01:48:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>). New generations of telescopes (like the 30-meter class) are expected to provide significant leaps in understanding [01:50:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, [01:50:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:14">[01:50:14]</a>).

## Age of the Universe and Earth

### Arguments for a Young Universe/Earth
The argument for a young universe and Earth relies on several points of [[Evidence for the Age of the Universe and Earth | evidence]]:
*   **Cosmic Observations**:
    *   The observation of "ready, structured" galaxies in the early universe, as seen by James Webb, supports a young universe model [03:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>, [03:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:09">[03:00:09]</a>, [03:00:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:48">[03:00:48]</a>). If it were billions of years old, it would appear "aged" and "very different" [03:00:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>, [03:00:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:28">[03:00:28]</a>).
    *   The Moon's recession rate (4 cm per year) suggests it would have collided with Earth 1.5 billion years ago, implying a younger age for the Earth-Moon system [02:59:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:27">[02:59:27]</a>, [02:59:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:33">[02:59:33]</a>).
    *   Jupiter radiating twice as much heat as it absorbs from the sun, and its current temperature being 120 degrees Celsius above the universe's temperature, suggests it is rapidly cooling and thus young ("a hot potato in the freezer") [02:59:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>, [02:59:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>, [02:59:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:13">[02:59:13]</a>).
    *   Jupiter's magnetic field, observed by Voyager probes, is "immense" but should decay over billions of years, indicating a younger age [02:59:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>, [02:59:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>).
    *   Comets, made of ice, melt as they pass the sun, and their maximum lifetime is estimated at 100,000 years. Their continued existence without a proven source of new comets (like the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt) suggests a younger solar system [02:58:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, [02:58:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:04">[02:58:04]</a>, [02:58:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:06">[02:58:06]</a>, [02:58:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>, [02:58:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:51">[02:58:51]</a>).

*   **Geological and Biological Observations**:
    *   Continental margins fit together perfectly, suggesting they haven't been subject to erosion over millions of years [03:25:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:23">[03:25:23]</a>, [03:25:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>, [03:32:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>, [03:36:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:30">[03:36:30]</a>).
    *   River deltas show sediment accumulation rates that, if extrapolated, would only account for 6,000 years of formation [02:59:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:39">[02:59:39]</a>, [02:59:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:42">[02:59:42]</a>, [02:59:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>, [02:59:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>).
    *   Earth's atmosphere has "very little Helium," an end product of radioisotope decay, implying a younger age [02:59:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>, [03:27:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>, [03:27:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:13">[03:27:13]</a>).
    *   Ocean salinity levels, if accumulated over billions of years, would make oceans either completely without salt or "extremely salty" if not for specific removal mechanisms [03:27:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:21">[03:27:21]</a>, [03:27:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:30">[03:27:30]</a>, [03:27:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:35">[03:27:35]</a>).
    *   Carbon-14 (C-14) is found in organic materials worldwide, including diamonds and fossils, which have a half-life of 5,730 years. The presence of C-14 in samples supposedly millions of years old suggests a much younger age [03:27:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:40">[03:27:40]</a>, [03:27:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:49">[03:27:49]</a>, [03:27:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:52">[03:27:52]</a>, [03:27:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:56">[03:27:56]</a>).
    *   The oldest living trees (Methuselah pine in California and the Great-Grandfather Pine in Chile) are around 4,800-5,000 years old, aligning with a younger Earth [03:28:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:46">[03:28:46]</a>, [03:28:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:54">[03:28:54]</a>).
    *   The history of civilizations and writing is no more than 6,000 years old [03:29:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:10">[03:29:10]</a>, [03:29:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:12">[03:29:12]</a>).
    *   Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome sequencing suggest all humans originated from a single woman (Mitochondrial Eve) and man (Y-chromosomal Adam) who lived approximately 6,000 years ago [03:29:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:27">[03:29:27]</a>, [03:29:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:30">[03:29:30]</a>, [03:29:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:32">[03:29:32]</a>, [03:29:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:40">[03:29:40]</a>, [03:29:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>, [03:29:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:46">[03:29:46]</a>).
    *   The Human Genome Project shows that humans accumulate "deleterious mutations" at a rate of 50 to 100 per generation, leading to an accumulation of defects. This rate, if extrapolated, points to an Earth age of around 6,000 years before significant degradation [03:29:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:56">[03:29:56]</a>, [03:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, [03:30:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:02">[03:30:02]</a>, [03:30:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:13">[03:30:13]</a>, [03:30:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:37">[03:30:37]</a>, [03:30:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:40">[03:30:40]</a>).

*   **Fossil Record**: The fossil record, including soft tissue found in dinosaur fossils, suggests a quick fossilization process rather than millions of years, which aligns with carbon-14 dating [03:26:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:20">[03:26:20]</a>, [03:26:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:23">[03:26:23]</a>, [03:31:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:30">[03:31:30]</a>, [03:31:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:35">[03:31:35]</a>).

>[!NOTE] Intelligent Design and Age of the Universe/Earth
>The Intelligent Design (ID) movement focuses on whether the universe shows signs of intelligent design, without necessarily specifying the age of the universe or Earth. Proponents of ID may hold various views on cosmology, including adherence to the Big Bang or an old universe [03:00:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:53">[03:00:53]</a>, [03:00:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:55">[03:00:55]</a>, [03:01:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>), [03:01:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a>, [03:01:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:08">[03:01:08]</a>, [03:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:12">[03:01:12]</a>, [03:55:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:21">[03:55:21]</a>). The personal opinion of some participants is that the universe is young based on scientific evidence, independent of ID theory [03:01:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:16">[03:01:16]</a>, [03:01:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>, [03:01:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:25">[03:01:25]</a>).

The following article details personal experiences and anecdotes from a long career in [[law_enforcement_and_public_safety | military policing]] and later as a federal deputy, offering insights into the realities of combating crime, responding to accidents, and navigating the political landscape.

## Early Life and Entry into the Police Force
Born in Londrina, the speaker moved to Maringá at a few months old, growing up "on the street" playing childhood games like "war of castor oil" and "war of persimmons" [09:06:00]. At 16, after an incident involving school wall graffiti that led to a "plea bargain" (where a friend reported him) and a stern talk from his father, he left Maringá for São Paulo [11:16:00].

His motivation to join the police force stemmed from a childhood experience where he was frustrated about not getting a ride in a police car, unlike some other students [13:41:00]. His older brother, now a colonel in the police reserve, explained the process of becoming a police officer [13:52:00]. He joined the Military Police in 1983 at 19 years old, passing the exam and entering a rigid training school [14:16:00]. This military training, described as "absurd" and "grotesque," provided him with a "structure of life" that "formed his character" and "forged his personality" [14:54:00].

## Military Police Career and Retirement
His career progression within the Military Police started as a soldier, then promoted to corporal, sergeant, and finally first sergeant [20:17:00]. He retired on June 17th after 35 years of mandatory service, the maximum time allowed [20:38:00]. On his last day, he was actively working on duty when his commander sent him home to avoid administrative problems if an accident occurred after his service time expired [20:49:00]. He lamented having to leave despite feeling he had "a lot to offer to the state of Paraná" [24:21:00].

## Memorable Incidents and Investigations
Throughout his career, the speaker was involved in numerous high-profile and unusual cases. He emphasized that his work involved deep dives into criminal activities, often going beyond surface-level observations.

### Last Day of Service: The Marijuana Bust
On his very last day, he was working the night shift approaching buses coming from the border [27:16:00]. He noticed a young woman in seat 16 who appeared "disoriented" [28:26:00]. After inspecting her belongings, he discovered she was refusing luggage that was tagged to her seat [29:51:00]. The luggage contained approximately 12 kg of marijuana [30:04:00]. A phone call from the apprehended woman led to the arrest of her girlfriend at the bus station with another 10 kg of marijuana, revealing they were traveling on separate buses to mitigate risk [30:15:00].

### Contraband and Smuggling
His unit's primary focus was "catching bandits on the highways" [33:53:00]. He became highly experienced in identifying various forms of contraband, especially from Paraguay [33:56:00]. Common items included:
*   **Cigarettes**: Often transported in modified cars and trucks, sometimes with "beaters" scouting the road ahead [36:07:00]. He noted that the profit margins were so high for smugglers that it made it hard for legitimate businesses to compete with the low labor costs for "goat" drivers [1:09:00].
*   **Electronics**: Pirated CDs, video games (PlayStation, Xbox), cell phone screens, and even disassembled cell phone parts were frequently seized [36:45:00].
*   **Miscellaneous Goods**: Toys, dental equipment, microphones, and even sex shop products like vibrators of "all sizes" and "little balls" were found [37:29:00].

### Drug Busts
He recounted several significant drug interdictions:
*   **Crack in a Compressor**: An unsuspecting seizure of an air compressor, thought to be just another smuggled item, was later discovered by Federal Revenue to contain 7 kg of crack hidden inside a welded compartment after a trained agent recognized its potential during a course [39:20:00].
*   **Cocaine in a Gas Tank**: While investigating a suspicious couple in a car, sniffer dogs alerted to the gas tank [41:12:00]. Upon inspection, four bricks of cocaine were found inside, leading to the arrest of the couple, including a pregnant teenager [42:32:00]. He stressed the importance of experience in locating hidden compartments, comparing it to seeing "the drinks I drink, don't see the falls that I fall" [46:17:00].
*   **Crack in a False Bottom**: During a nighttime inspection at a restaurant, his team discovered 83 kg of crack cocaine hidden in a "well-done false bottom" in a car's luggage rack [48:50:00]. The crack's chemical smell was distinct [49:18:00]. This operation highlighted the police's dedication, as they continued searching despite their shift ending [50:42:00].

### Stolen Vehicles and "Goats"
His unit frequently dealt with stolen vehicles, often used for transporting contraband [52:43:00]. He shared an anecdote of two brothers driving stolen Renegade Jeeps, one of whom attempted to bribe him with R$5,000 [53:39:00]. Another incident involved a white S10 pickup truck with original license plates, which was actually stolen, revealing the sophistication of criminals who used "dubbed" vehicles [55:03:00].

### Human Trafficking
He described catching buses full of illegal immigrants, particularly Haitians, entering Brazil via Paraguay without proper documentation [1:34:52]. While these cases were forwarded to the Federal Police, he noted the frustration of seeing them often released due to legal and financial complexities [1:35:41].

### Unusual Contraband
Beyond common drugs and cigarettes, he seized a variety of unexpected items:
*   **Medicines**: Including strong rheumatism drugs (Rheumazin Forte), abortifacients (Cytotec), Viagra, and weight-loss drugs (Sibutramine), often banned by regulatory agencies like Anvisa due to health risks or being smuggled from Paraguay [1:18:50].
*   **Anabolics**: Injectable anabolic steroids for both human and veterinary use [1:25:02].
*   **Hookah Essence and Electronic Cigarettes**: These were also frequently seized, with electronic cigarettes being a high-value item that smugglers would go to great lengths to protect [1:25:40].

## Accident Response and Tragedies
His time on the highway also exposed him to numerous tragic accidents, where his priority was always signaling the track to prevent further collisions, assisting victims, and contacting the appropriate authorities [1:38:03].

He recounted a particularly harrowing accident involving a Corolla and a Pointer that caught fire, trapping a 15-year-old girl inside [1:38:52]. Despite efforts, she burned to death, an image that deeply affected him [1:42:00]. Other incidents included a motorcyclist being run over by multiple cars and a woman decapitated by a car's rearview mirror [1:47:39]. These experiences highlighted the brutal reality of highway policing and the importance of safety measures like seatbelts [1:51:32].

## Confrontations and Dangers
The speaker often faced direct threats and violence in the line of duty.

### Exchanging Gunfire
He recounted an instance where his team was shot at by three individuals who abandoned their car after a chase [2:04:26]. He returned fire from inside his vehicle, a police technique he had learned in training [2:08:20]. The bandits, who were attempting a robbery, had long guns, a balaclava, a vest with fake explosives (used to intimidate victims), and "Miguelito" spikes to puncture tires [2:19:00].

### Views on Weapons and Crime
He emphasized the importance of police officers having rifles for "first confrontation" [2:12:45]. He is actively working as a deputy to secure funding for more rifles for the Paraná Military Police, arguing that their "thunderous" impact and ability to "drill brick walls" are necessary to deter organized crime [2:11:17]. He believes that while legal channels exist for gun ownership, the vast majority of illegal weapons enter Brazil through [[analyzing_real_crimes | smuggling]], often hidden within large cargo shipments [2:16:13]. He recounted a seizure of 3,000 rifle rounds meant "to kill the police" in Rio de Janeiro [2:17:57]. He stressed that ballistic vests for rifles require ceramic plates, which are different from those designed for pistol rounds [2:18:37].

## Views on Crime and Justice
His experiences shaped a strong stance on crime and justice.

### Perspective on Criminals
He holds a firm belief that criminals who commit heinous acts like rape and murder are "human evil" and a "relief to society" if arrested or killed [2:22:46]. He explicitly stated that he believes "bandit must be exterminated" [2:26:21].

### Support for Harsher Penalties
He supports "life imprisonment" and even the "death penalty" for criminals like those responsible for child rape and murder [2:28:24]. He is working on a legislative decree for a plebiscite on life imprisonment in Brazil [2:27:53]. He also proposed a project to allow organs of criminals killed in confrontation to be "donated to those in the queue for transplant compulsorily" [2:53:16].

### The "Tower Maniac" Case
He detailed the chilling case of Natanael Buffalo, known as the "Tower Maniac" in Maringá [2:25:00]. The man, previously convicted of sexual abuse, gained the trust of a church community after being released from prison [2:25:57]. He then abducted, raped, and brutally murdered an 11-year-old girl, burning her body in a rural area [2:26:15]. The case highlighted the need for stricter sentencing and the danger posed by repeat offenders [2:27:19]. He recalled a personal encounter with the "Tower Maniac" ten years prior, where he refrained from shooting him despite the man lunging at him with a pickaxe [2:33:59]. He now regrets not taking a more decisive action, believing it could have saved the lives of the later victims [2:35:55].

### Drug Use
He differentiates between various drug users, stating, "not every pothead is a bum, but all a bum is a pothead" [2:55:40]. He acknowledges that some users maintain productive lives but warns about the slippery slope to harder drugs and crime [2:56:10]. He also applies this perspective to alcohol, noting that while some can drink responsibly, others fall into ruin [2:57:12]. His own past experiences with excessive drinking led to "administrative problems" and "disciplinary punishments" within the Military Police, leading him to abstain completely [2:57:43].

## Transition to Politics
He was "pushed into politics" by people who saw his potential during interviews [2:44:26]. Initially hesitant, he became a federal deputy candidate in 2014, securing a substitute position [2:46:15]. In 2018, he was the most voted federal deputy in Paraná [2:48:03]. As a deputy, he focuses on fighting crime and valuing [[law_enforcement_and_public_safety | Public Security]] operators, advocating for decent wages, working hours, and "first world vehicles, weapons, and equipment" [2:49:03]. He supports legislation that benefits police and other public safety personnel, such as approving the minimum wage for nursing professionals [2:51:34].

### Views on the Censorship Bill
He strongly opposes the proposed censorship bill, calling it "a great lobby" driven by "financial profits" and a "fearful" response to the rise of internet platforms [3:00:00]. He views it as an attempt by traditional media and "left-wing" artists to control information and profit from content sharing [3:00:19]. He cites instances where the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has overstepped its bounds, such as ordering Telegram to remove content and post the Minister's opinion, which he considers an "absurd" "intrusion of power" [3:05:44]. He believes the bill's intention is to mask "bad things" that "ruin the whole body of the project" [3:02:46].

### Personal Immunity and Legal Battles
He reflected on the complexities of parliamentary immunity, citing past legal battles for comments made during his police career [3:08:36]. He was once sued by the Federal Public Ministry for referring to arrested drug traffickers as "the fat," "the chubby," and "Robocop" during an interview [3:09:12]. He also revealed that he is currently being sued in the STF by Marcola, the head of the PCC, for comments made about his health on a podcast [3:14:03].

## Personal Impact of Police Work
The speaker shared the profound personal impact of his career.

### Heart Attacks on Duty
He revealed that he suffered five heart attacks, three of which occurred while he was on duty in Military Police vehicles [2:36:50]. One heart attack happened after he went to identify the body of a friend who had been run over by a bus [2:37:37]. Another occurred during a house invasion of drug dealers [2:38:17]. These incidents highlight the immense stress and emotional toll of his profession [2:37:26].

### Psychological Impact
Witnessing severe tragedies and extreme human evil, such as the rape and murder of children, has deeply affected him [2:48:00]. He mentioned that these experiences lead him to be more cautious and suspicious, especially when traveling [1:18:50].

## Reflections on Societal Issues
He reflected on broader societal issues, particularly the contrast between criminal activity and the struggles of ordinary citizens. He supports harsher penalties for cell phone theft and robbery, arguing that these crimes disproportionately affect the lives of everyday people who depend on their devices [3:16:08]. He believes that while criminal factions exist and pose a threat, the focus should be on dismantling their financial structure and confronting their members rather than just naming them [3:35:00]. He concludes by emphasizing his passion for public service and his commitment to his convictions, regardless of criticism [3:29:57].

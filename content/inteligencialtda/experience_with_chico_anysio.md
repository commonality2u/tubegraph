The journey into comedy and television was profoundly shaped by the influence and direct interaction with [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]]'s idol, Chico Anysio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Early Inspiration and Encounter
[[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]]'s earliest memory of comedy dates back to watching Oscarito and Jerry Lewis on black and white television at around 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Later, at 16 or 17, this curiosity deepened as he realized that Chico Anysio and Renato Aragão, major comedians, were from his home state of Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Chico Anysio served as a significant "light" and inspiration for [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]]'s desire to enter television humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

The opportunity to meet Chico Anysio arose when [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] was given a script from one of his shows to record commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. He took this recording, hoping Chico would hear it and recognize his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. To meet Chico, [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] located him through a neighbor, Aninha, whose cousin worked as Chico's secretary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Initially, Chico's cousin, Jairo, received [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] coldly, expressing reluctance to disturb Chico's rest for an aspiring comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. However, Aninha secretly provided Chico's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.

### The Direct Approach
Undeterred, [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] drove to Chico Anysio's beach house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Seeing Chico sitting by the pool, he was overwhelmed by seeing his idol in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>. A security guard initially intercepted him, but Chico intervened, asking what [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] introduced himself as an artist who recorded Chico's show commercials and worked at a radio station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. When asked if he wrote, [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] lied and said yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. He then retrieved a large recorder from his car to demonstrate his various voices and characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. After about two and a half minutes of listening, Chico Anysio stopped the tape and told [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]]: "I want to work with me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

## Working Relationship and Mentorship
Chico Anysio instructed [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] to go to Rede Globo in Rio de Janeiro by the end of February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. This marked the beginning of a decade-long pursuit, from 1982 to 1992, for [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] to secure his place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. He faced challenges, including a flight with a broken landing gear and being initially denied entry at Globo's reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.

### Guidance and Early Roles
A pivotal moment came through the mediation of Fagner and Zico, who helped [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] finally meet Chico Anysio at Zico's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Chico, upon seeing him, expressed surprise that [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] hadn't shown up earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. He then gave [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] his phone number and assigned him the task of writing scripts for two characters, Azambuja and a dyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. Since [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] couldn't write well at the time, he secretly enlisted the help of Nonato Albuquerque, a journalist and Portuguese professor, who wrote the initial texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. Chico loved the texts and requested more, specifically for a character named Salomé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

This led to [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]]'s involvement in "Escolinha do Professor Raimundo" (Professor Raimundo's School) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. His first appearances were as an extra, but he enjoyed performing voices and types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. He made an effort to be present daily at Globo's recordings, knowing that "who is seen is remembered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. Chico eventually asked [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] to perform his "old man" character from Fortaleza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. During a trip with Chico to Fortaleza, [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] showed him his "drunk" character, which became the famous João Canabrava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Chico saw its revolutionary potential for the classroom setting of "Escolinha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

### "Escolinha do Professor Raimundo" and "Sai de Baixo"
[[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] spent four years on "Escolinha do Professor Raimundo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>. He then moved to "Sai de Baixo" with the consent of Boni, the director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. This decision, however, initially hurt Chico, who felt [[career_of_tom_cavalcante | Tom Cavalcante]] was leaving prematurely after being given an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. With the help of friends like Rico and Fagner, Chico eventually understood that "people have to fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

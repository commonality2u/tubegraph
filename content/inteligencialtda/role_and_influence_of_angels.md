Angels are celestial beings created by God, existing in a hierarchical structure within the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. They play a significant role in God's plan and in the ongoing [[spiritual_warfare_and_demonic_influence | spiritual warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

## Nature and Hierarchy
Angels possess free will, and their choice to follow or rebel against God determined their eternal alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The Bible describes various types of angels with different functions:

*   **Cherubim and Seraphim:** These are powerful celestial beings who attend at the Throne of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. Cherubim, for instance, were placed to guard the Garden of Eden after Adam's expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. Their biblical descriptions, often multi-winged and eyed, differ significantly from popular artistic depictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.
*   **Archangels:** Among the highest in angelic hierarchy, meaning "first demon" in terms of authority according to one interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>. Michael is identified as an Archangel who fights for the people of Israel and is considered a "General of the armies of the Most High" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. Gabriel is known as a messenger angel, famously announcing the birth of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>.

## Satan and Fallen Angels (Demons)
Satan, originally an anointed Cherub, was once the most powerful creature in heaven and led worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>. His fall resulted from iniquity found in his heart, as he desired to be like God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. He convinced a third of the angels to follow him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:16">[01:51:16]</a>, and these fallen angels became demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>.

*   **Satan's Status and Influence:** Despite his fall, Satan is not trapped in hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. He is referred to as the "prince of the power of the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:59">[01:43:59]</a> and resides in the "second heaven," which is described as the empire of darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. He still retains access to the "third heaven," where God's throne is, as evidenced in the Book of Job where he dialogues with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>.
*   **Satan's Power and Plan:** Satan maintains his power, though he lost his position as an anointed cherub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. He has the power to perform deceptive miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. His overarching plan is to steal worship from humanity and disrupt God's plan of redemption by taking as many souls as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. He attempts to destroy those God loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.
*   **Attempts Against the Messiah:** Knowing that a Messiah would come from the Jewish people to ultimately crush his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, Satan repeatedly tried to eliminate the liberator. He attempted to kill Moses through Pharaoh's decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a> and later sought to kill Jesus when He was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Role of Righteous Angels
God's faithful angels serve His purposes, protecting and ministering according to His will.

*   **Guardian Angels:** The Bible indicates that "the angels of the Lord encamp at around the one who fears them and delivers them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>, suggesting a protective role, possibly more than one guardian angel per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_jesus_in_the_old_testament | Jesus as the Angel of the Lord]]:** In the Old Testament, Jesus sometimes manifested as "the Angel of the Lord" (a Christophany or Theophany) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>. Unlike other angels who refuse worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>, the Angel of the Lord receives worship, confirming His divine nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:05">[02:44:05]</a>. Joshua, for example, worshiped the Captain of the armies of the Most High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>.

## [[spiritual_warfare_and_demonic_influence | Spiritual Warfare]] and Angelic Involvement
The spiritual world is engaged in a constant war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>, and this battle physically affects humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:59">[03:41:59]</a>.

*   **The Battlefield:** The primary battlefield is the mind, influencing the body and causing fatigue, discouragement, and invasive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The spiritual realm also influences the physical world, affecting even inanimate objects or plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:55">[04:22:55]</a>.
*   **Hierarchy in Conflict:** The Bible states that the human fight is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in heavenly regions (Ephesians 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>. This hierarchy reflects on Earth, with a "Principality" influencing each country or region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>. Angels and demons are in constant conflict, with angels fulfilling God's will using His name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Demonic Entry Points:** Demons can gain access to individuals through "legality" or "gaps" created by sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. Sins such as anger, sexual immorality, or drug use create openings for demonic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:04">[03:01:04]</a>. The Greek word for witchcraft, "Pharmakeia," is linked to drugs, as ancient sorcerers used them to induce altered mental states, creating openings for demonic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:54">[03:01:54]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_battles | Spiritual Weapons]]:** To combat spiritual attacks, individuals are encouraged to use the "whole armor of God" as described in Ephesians 6, which includes:
    *   **Belt of Truth:** Represents the foundational truth of God's word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:53">[05:52:53]</a>.
    *   **Breastplate of Righteousness:** Protects the heart and vital areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:13">[05:53:13]</a>.
    *   **Shoes of the Gospel of Peace:** Readiness to spread the good news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:29">[05:53:29]</a>.
    *   **Shield of Faith:** Used to extinguish "all the inflamed data of the evil one" (fiery darts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:11">[05:54:11]</a>.
    *   **Helmet of Salvation:** Protects the mind, signifying assurance of salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:02">[05:56:02]</a>.
    *   **Sword of the Spirit (Word of God):** The only offensive weapon, used to declare what God says over one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:03">[05:57:03]</a>.

Other practical tools include prayer, fasting, and seeking help from trusted spiritual leaders or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:12">[05:57:12]</a>. Closing doors to demonic influence involves confessing sins, asking for forgiveness, and filling oneself with God's word and praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:36">[03:02:36]</a>.

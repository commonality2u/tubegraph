Exiting an [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized crime]] faction like the PCC presents immense challenges, often putting an individual's life at extreme risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Frank, a former member of the PCC from 2016 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, shares his experience of the difficulties and dangers involved in leaving the organization, highlighting that his motivation was to bring awareness to young people that the path of justice is the right one, not crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## The Process of Leaving the PCC

While one is not forced to join the PCC, once baptized, a member is obligated to uphold their commitment and follow all directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This includes being dispatched to other states to commit crimes if ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

There are "several ways" to leave the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. One way is through "exclusion," which means being expelled but potentially remaining alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Members can also formally request to leave by submitting a "paper" to the command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Frank himself attempted this, wishing to dedicate more time to his children and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This request can lead to a "removal" or a 90-day "rest" period from organizational activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### The "Decreed" Status

Frank's own exclusion from the PCC was due to a statement he made about a change within the organization that he could not prove, leading to him being "decreed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. A "decreed" person is marked for death by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Any criminal in the State of SÃ£o Paulo can take the life of a decreed person without needing to go through a "crime court" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This status is why Frank believed he was going to die immediately after making his first public video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Life After Exiting Organized Crime

The primary challenge after leaving is the constant threat to one's life. Frank has been on the run for nearly nine months, moving from city to city, and country to country within South America (Uruguay, Chile, Argentina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He does not stay in one house for more than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> and receives daily threats, including videos of people being tortured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Lack of Support

Frank emphasizes that he operates without any government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Unlike witness protection programs in other countries, which offer identity changes, housing, and police protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>, such robust programs are not available in Brazil, especially for those who report "small fish" rather than high-level criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>. He also expresses a profound distrust in the Brazilian [[the_criminal_justice_system_and_its_challenges | justice system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>, citing his own experience of being released on R$25 bail after being caught in armed robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

Frank maintains his anonymity by using IP camouflage and VPNs, constantly changing residences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. His YouTube accounts, which provide his income, have been blocked due to malicious reports of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. He struggles to afford basic necessities like food and housing in more expensive South American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>.

### Societal Perception and Media Misrepresentation

Frank highlights the media's tendency to romanticize crime in series and movies, presenting criminals as victims of society and ignoring the true brutality of [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized crime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. He criticizes portrayals that make criminals seem sympathetic or even heroic, such as the series *Sintonia*, which he states is completely fictional in its depiction of joining the PCC and the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>.

He notes that the media often focuses on perceived police corruption while neglecting to report the full extent of criminal activities and the challenges faced by law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. This creates a distorted view that influences young people, making them believe crime offers a shortcut to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. Frank believes the crime should be ridiculed and seen as shameful, not glorified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:08">[03:09:08]</a>.

### Redemption and Purpose

Despite the constant danger and hardships, Frank feels a responsibility to share his story to open the eyes of young people and prevent them from entering [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized crime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. He admits to deep remorse for his past actions and strives to redeem himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. His survival, he believes, is solely due to divine intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>, giving him a purpose to continue exposing the reality of criminal factions.

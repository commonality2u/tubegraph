The Bible is considered the main rule and a very important guide for Catholics and Christians, serving as a primary reference point for understanding divine truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Origin and Purpose of the Bible

The authorship of the [[interpretation_of_the_bible_and_literary_genres | Bible]] began with God Himself, as evidenced by the stone tablets given to Moses, which were written with "the finger of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. The purpose of this divine writing is for humanity to never forget God's word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Even when the original tablets were broken by Moses in anger due to the people's ingratitude, God commanded Moses to carve new tablets, and God rewrote the words to ensure they would not be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

The apostle Paul, in 1 Thessalonians 2:13, emphasizes that the words received were not human words but "what it really is: as the word of God that acts effectively in voice the faithful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. This means the [[interpretation_of_the_bible_and_literary_genres | Bible]] is the direct word of God, not merely human interpretation or adaptation to the current world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

## Divine Plan and Human Free Will

A central theme in [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spiritual teachings]] is the balance between God's plan and human free will.

### God's Predestination
God created humanity in His image and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. According to Job 31:15, God created individuals in the womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Jeremiah 1:5 states, "before that in breast was formed I already knew you" and consecrated Jeremiah as a prophet before his birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. Ephesians 1:4 further elaborates that God chose humanity "in him [Christ] before the creation of the world" to be "holy and blameless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. This means God has a plan for each individual's life, and their existence is not by chance but by divine choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

### The Role of Free Will
Despite God's divine plan, individuals retain free will. God created humanity in freedom, and love for God cannot be forced; it must be a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. This concept is illustrated by the biblical account of Adam and Eve, who, despite being created in holiness and righteousness and given everything they needed, freely chose to disobey God by eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This tree symbolized their freedom to choose whether to follow God's authority or try to determine good and evil for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

God is omniscient and knew Adam and Eve would fall, but this knowledge did not mean He determined their fall; He offered them every means not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. God respects human freedom, as shown in Revelation 3:20, where Jesus says, "Here I am at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door for me I will enter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. God constantly "knocks on the door of the heart," offering various signs and ways to connect, respecting the individual's choice to open or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.

## Sin and Salvation

### The Nature of Sin
The [[religious_texts_and_interpretations | Catholic Church catechism]] defines sin as "a fault against reason, truth the straight conscience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. It is an act of "disobedience" or "lack of true love for God" stemming from "a perverse attachment to certain goods," harming human nature and solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. Sin is "an affront to God," preventing individuals from achieving [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. It is a lie the [[understanding_and_interpretation_of_spiritual_warfare | devil]] propagates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

Biblical texts like Galatians 5:19-21 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 provide lists of "works of the flesh" or "unrighteous" behaviors that prevent one from inheriting the Kingdom of God. These include:
*   Fornication (sex outside marriage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>
*   Impurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>
*   Licentiousness (living without law or standard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>
*   Idolatry (placing anything in God's place, e.g., money, social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>
*   Superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>
*   Enmities, fights, jealousy, hatred, ambition, discords, parties, envy, drunkenness, orgies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>
*   Adultery, effeminate behavior, debauchery, theft, greed, slander, robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>

These are not condemnations but warnings, as God desires everyone's [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

### The Path to Salvation
[[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | Salvation]] is offered through belief in Jesus Christ. John 3:16-17 states, "For God so loved the world who gave him his only son so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Belief, in this context, is not merely a feeling or acknowledging God's existence (as even the [[understanding_and_interpretation_of_spiritual_warfare | devil]] believes God exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>). True belief means putting one's life "about Jesus Christ," adhering to His person and His teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.

> [!tip] Repentance and Forgiveness
> Even those who have committed many sins can be "washed" and "sanctified" through sincere repentance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. The [[interpretation_of_the_bible_and_literary_genres | Bible]] is a book of [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]], offering a way out for the "worst people" and "worst sins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. The only sin for which there is no forgiveness is the sin against the Holy Spirit, which occurs when a person knowingly and freely chooses to close themselves off from God's grace and does not want forgiveness or [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>.

## Living in Holiness

Holiness is the ultimate purpose for which humanity was chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. To be holy means to be "another Christ" â€“ to imitate Jesus Christ so closely that one resembles Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. This involves a process of transformation where one "kills the old man" (sinful nature), recognizes oneself as a sinner, seeks forgiveness, and progressively embraces Christ's virtues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. It requires abandoning everything that does not align with Christ and embracing virtues like joy, peace, unity, kindness, love, and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

Holiness is the best proposal for life and leads to true happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>. Conversely, living in sin only brings fleeting carnal pleasure, leading to emptiness and unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:23">[02:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:33">[02:03:33]</a>. God desires good works from humanity, as Ephesians 2:10 states, "we are your work created in Jesus Christ for the good deeds that God beforehand prepared for us to practice them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:14">[02:05:14]</a>. At the judgment seat of Christ, everyone will receive what they deserve according to the good or evil they have done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.

## The Church's Role in Interpreting Truth

The Catholic Church stands as a defender of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. This truth is not a theory but a person: Jesus Christ Himself, who stated, "I am the path the truth and the life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>. The [[understanding_and_interpretation_of_spiritual_warfare | devil]], the "father of lies," is characterized by not remaining in the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

The Church's teachings, such as those regarding homosexuality, are based on [[religious_texts_and_interpretations | Sacred Scripture]] and tradition, not personal opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The [[religious_texts_and_interpretations | Catholic Church catechism]] (2357) defines homosexuality as a "predominant sexual attraction for people of the same sex" and, "relying on sacred scripture," presents homosexual acts as "depravities serious" and "intrinsically disorderly," because they are "against the law natural" and "close the sexual act to the gift of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. While the Church condemns the sin, it does not condemn the sinner, advocating for acceptance, compassion, and delicacy towards individuals with homosexual tendencies, calling them to chastity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:32">[01:59:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>.

## Contemporary Challenges to Truth

The present era is described as one of "spiritual and moral calamity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>. A major challenge is the societal tendency to "call evil good and good evil," changing "darkness into light and light into darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>. This societal disorientation stems from a loss of the sense of truth and a departure from Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>.

There is a growing imposition of ideologies that deny objective truth, leading people to believe their "own truth" even when it contradicts clear facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. This extends to attempts to forbid speaking about certain truths, including within churches, as such speech can be deemed "offensive" by secular standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. However, freedom of expression is crucial for evangelization, as "how are they going to believe if they don't have whoever preaches?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:34">[01:47:34]</a>.

### Eschatological Perspectives
Regarding the [[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | coming of Christ]], the [[interpretation_of_the_bible_and_literary_genres | Bible]] states that "no one knows" the exact day or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>. However, the current societal condition, where evil is called good and good is called evil, is seen as a significant sign that things are "getting ugly" and are "getting closer and closer" to the [[interpretations_of_biblical_prophecy_and_the_end_times | last days]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. The [[understanding_and_interpretation_of_spiritual_warfare | devil]], knowing his time is short, is filled with "great anger" and actively tries to lead souls astray by painting himself as "the good guy" while portraying God as "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:16">[02:09:16]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Importance of Christ

Ultimately, all aspects of life and [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spiritual understanding]] lead to Jesus Christ, who is the absolute "truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. Outside of Christ, humanity is lost in lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. To avoid falling into sin and the path of unhappiness, one must adhere to Christ's teachings and follow His word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:24">[02:01:24]</a>. The world and its lusts will pass away, but God's word endures forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:36">[03:14:36]</a>. Jesus must be the most important aspect of one's life, more important than work, family, or personal philosophies, because He is God incarnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:24">[03:15:24]</a>.

Tom Cavalcante's illustrious [[comedy careers and personal stories | comedy career]] began with humble roots in Ceará, evolving through radio, television, and stand-up, marked by significant personal challenges and pivotal encounters that shaped his unique comedic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Born Antônio Cavalcante, his earliest memory of comedy dates back to watching Oscarito and Jerry Lewis on black and white television around the age of 10, though he didn't fully understand it, he found their physical comedy hilarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Growing up, he realized that legendary comedians like Chico Anysio and Renato Aragão hailed from his home state of Ceará, sparking his curiosity in performance around ages 16 or 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

His initial foray into public speaking was through reading homilies in church, where he enjoyed hearing his voice amplified by the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He participated in youth musical groups and *jograis* (groups that sang at mass), always finding himself drawn to acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Despite being shy in everyday life, the stage gave him strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

His father, a resourceful salesman, unknowingly introduced Tom to the world of performance by bringing home various books and collections, including "Barça collections" and "Russian World of the Child," which fostered a childhood full of reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. His father was also a naturally good-humored and extroverted man who could entertain friends with jokes, influencing Tom's own comedic inclinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

A significant turning point occurred when his mother passed away suddenly when he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This abrupt loss, which took years to process (requiring therapy until he was about 27 or 28), pushed him towards survival and choosing happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. He channeled his emotions into humor, making jokes and playing with life, developing a "shield against death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## From Football to Radio and Television

After his mother's death, Tom moved between relatives' homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. During this period, he found solace in playing football in the neighborhood, where he adopted the nickname "Marcelo" from a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He played for youth teams in Ceará, including Ceará's youth team and a club of the Air Force, dedicating about 16 years to football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

His interest in radio began during his football days, as he would listen to professional announcers at stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. He started imitating them at school and on the field, leading friends to suggest he had a knack for radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. He eventually started visiting radio stations, landing a job as a proofreader at a newspaper while doing tests at a newly opened FM station in Ceará, Rádio Povo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

It was at Rádio Povo that the director suggested he prepare a joke show for a beach hut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. He began imitating famous singers like Gilberto Gil, Fagner, and Belchior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. His first show was a mix of singing and impressions, initially facing skepticism but eventually gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. His radio career led him to a contest on FM 93, which he joined as the last of 40 announcers due to his shyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. He took the overnight shift from 3 AM to 4 AM, using it as an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. It was João Inácio Junior, a prominent figure in Ceará radio, who suggested the stage name "Tom Cavalcante" to him around this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

His desire to enter television grew, and he began presenting educational TV modules for the federal government in Ceará, teaching subjects like Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

## Meeting Chico Anysio and the Breakthrough

Tom's biggest break came through a determined effort to meet his idol, Chico Anysio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. After recording commercials for Chico Anysio's show, he found a way to deliver a tape of his own impressions and characters directly to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Tom emphasizes that Chico Anysio is one of the greatest comedians globally, known for creating over 200 characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

When he finally met Chico Anysio, he expressed his desire to be a comedian. Chico's advice was simple: "It depends on you, brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. After hearing Tom's tape, Chico was impressed and told him to come to Rio in February to work with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Tom's journey to Rio was an adventure, involving a flight on an instruction plane that broke down and led to a very late arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

Despite the initial promise, getting into Globo was difficult, with gatekeepers and no direct contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. He kept returning to Rio, living in Niterói, while working at the radio and reviewing newspapers in Fortaleza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. His persistence paid off when a journalist introduced him to Chico Anysio's cousin, and eventually, through sheer determination and a chance encounter, he finally got a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

Chico Anysio gave him the mission to write texts for two characters, Azambuja and a dyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. Not knowing how to write scripts, Tom sought help from Nonato Albuquerque, a journalist and professor from Ceará, who wrote the initial texts for *Escolinha do Professor Raimundo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. Chico loved the texts and requested more, leading to Tom's official entry into Globo and his first appearance as an extra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

### *Escolinha do Professor Raimundo* and João Canabrava

Tom's pivotal character, João Canabrava, a drunk student, debuted on *Escolinha do Professor Raimundo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. The character was refined during his local shows in Fortaleza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. His debut on *Escolinha* was a surprise, as Chico Anysio called him up spontaneously during a recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. The audience loved it, and João Canabrava quickly became a national phenomenon, with the show itself commanding a 90% audience share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. This immediate success, after years of struggle, felt like a divine intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## *Sai de Baixo* and National Fame

After four successful years on *Escolinha*, Tom received an invitation to join *Sai de Baixo*, a decision approved by Globo's director, Boni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. This move meant leaving Rio for São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. Chico Anysio was initially hurt by Tom's departure, but eventually understood that artists need to "fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

On *Sai de Baixo*, Tom played Ribamar, a bungling doorman who loved to interfere in everyone's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. The show's format, set in an apartment building, was known for its improvisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. Initially, Tom, not being a traditional actor, struggled with stage markings, leading the directors to assign a dedicated camera to follow him around the set, allowing him to work freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. This improvisational freedom became a hallmark of the character, with Ribamar jumping into the audience, kitchen, and onto the sofa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

Tom learned a lot from his co-star Miguel Falabella, especially in improvisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. *Sai de Baixo* was not just about laughs; it offered social commentary, with characters like Miguel's arrogant rich man highlighting societal behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>. The show gained a reputation for being therapeutic, with a noticeable decrease in suicide rates on Sunday nights in São Paulo during its run, as it offered a dose of happiness before the work week began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>.

## *Mega Tom* and Record TV

After a successful run on *Sai de Baixo*, Tom decided to pursue his own program, *Mega Tom*, on Globo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>. This move, while a step forward for his career, caused some "malaise" within the *Sai de Baixo* team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>. Tom acknowledges that he handled the transition poorly, not communicating his decision adequately with his castmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a>. He later apologized to them, and they maintain close friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.

*Mega Tom* aired in the afternoon, competing against popular Sunday shows. It was a lighter, more family-friendly program, which Tom found he didn't adapt to as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.

After a year, Tom received an "irrefutable" offer from Record TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. This decision was a big risk, as Globo, at the time, was a powerful network, and leaving could mean never returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>. He paid a hefty fine to break his contract with Globo, driven by a desire for creative freedom and the opportunity to work with a new team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. He hired a large production team, including comedians like Tirulipa, Shaolin, and Alexandre Frota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>. His show on Record was a daily program, requiring intense work and constant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>. He challenged dogmas and pushed boundaries, even involving religious figures and controversial topics in his humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:58">[01:54:58]</a>. The show achieved impressive ratings, especially with segments filmed in public spaces like Praça da Sé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>.

## International Aspirations and Return to Brazil

After seven intense years at Record, Tom felt physically and mentally exhausted, desiring a break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>. He decided to move to Los Angeles for a year, paying another fine to end his contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:43">[02:01:43]</a>. He studied cinema, financed his own feature film, and sought to understand the Hollywood industry, meeting agents and learning about their working methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>. While there, he experienced the typical challenges of a foreigner trying to break into the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>.

Eventually, opportunities in Brazil, particularly with Multishow and Amazon Prime, led him to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>. He now works on shows like *Dr. Darci* and *LOL: Last One Laughing*, where he served as a host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>.

## Modern Era and Political Humor

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tom embraced the internet, creating videos that allowed him to experiment with his comedic approach and connect with a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>. He particularly found success with political humor, imitating figures like Bolsonaro and Lula, and observing the monetization of his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:48">[02:33:48]</a>.

He highlights the evolving nature of humor, acknowledging that what was acceptable decades ago might not be today, emphasizing the need for comedians to test limits and break dogmas while maintaining good intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. He stresses the importance of training and preparation for live shows, allowing for creative freedom within a structured framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:53">[03:08:53]</a>.

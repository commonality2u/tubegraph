The popular series *Everybody Hates Chris* holds a special place in the hearts of many, particularly in Brazil. Vincent Martella, who played Greg Wuliger, shared insights into the show's production, its cultural impact, and his personal [[comedy_careers_and_personal_stories | experiences in the entertainment industry]].

## Early Career and Joining the Show

Vincent Martella began acting at a young age, around 10 or 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. His career progression started with commercials, then a stint as a background actor, leading to auditions for TV series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>. He eventually auditioned for *Everybody Hates Chris* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. The show offered a consistent job, with recording lasting for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

While working on the series, Martella also ventured into voice acting for cartoons and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>. He expressed satisfaction with his work, stating he has fun and works with people he loves, aiming to continue entertaining audiences through cartoons, series, and movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.

## The Production Process

### Pilot Episode and Uncertainty
The pilot episode for *Everybody Hates Chris* was filmed when Martella was 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:42">[02:12:42]</a>, and the first season began production when he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:46">[02:14:46]</a>. Martella explained that filming a pilot doesn't guarantee the show will air, and actors can even be replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:51">[02:15:51]</a>. He has experienced this rejection multiple times with other sitcoms and even animated cartoons where pilots were not selected after full animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.

### Working with Rejection
Dealing with rejection is a challenging, yet common, aspect of the [[challenges_of_working_in_the_entertainment_industry | entertainment industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:34">[02:33:34]</a>. Martella recounted auditioning four or five times for *Everybody Hates Chris* over nearly two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. He advises younger actors only to pursue acting if they truly love it and are passionate about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>.

> "I tell younger actors who ask me for advice, it's like, don't do it unless you really love it, that it's your passion, and that you're happy doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>

### Filming Schedule and Child Actors
Production for *Everybody Hates Chris* involved specific schedules due to child labor laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:25">[03:29:25]</a>. Child actors under 18 could only work a certain number of hours and required a teacher on set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:34">[03:37:34]</a>. Initially, filming ran from July to January, but this changed to April to September to reduce school interference during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:55">[03:52:55]</a>. The series recorded for about half the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:07">[04:08:07]</a>.

### Cast Relationships
Martella formed close bonds with the cast, especially his younger co-stars, growing up together on set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. He highlighted the valuable mentorship from experienced actors like Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. Arnold, having been in several sitcoms, provided valuable resources for the younger cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:01">[04:07:01]</a>. Martella maintained good friendships and saw the careers of his co-stars flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:44">[04:09:44]</a>.

#### Chris Rock's Advice
Chris Rock, whose life the series was based on, offered Martella some memorable advice when he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:03">[04:12:03]</a>. Rock told him, "Now that you're in Hollywood, don't smoke crack. Don't smoke crack, or you'll never come back. I don't want to see you on the season of smoking crack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:06">[04:15:06]</a>. Martella stated he has never smoked crack, attributing it jokingly to Rock's advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

#### Meeting Samuel L. Jackson
Martella recalled a particularly nerve-wracking day on set when the showrunner introduced him to "Sam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. To his surprise, "Sam" turned out to be Samuel L. Jackson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Jackson was visiting because he knew Chris Rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This encounter made Martella incredibly nervous, feeling the pressure to perform well in front of a respected actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Writing and Character Development
Martella often engaged with the writers, especially in the later seasons, to understand the episodes from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:19">[04:19:19]</a>. He noted that the writers, many of whom came from successful shows like *Saturday Night Live*, had vast experience in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

#### Character Slang and Accuracy
The production team for *Everybody Hates Chris* meticulously researched slang from the 1980s to ensure accuracy in the scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. They had to verify if terms like "dude" or "man" were commonly used in the 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This attention to detail ensured the show's authenticity to its historical setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### The Series Finale
The fourth season was known to be the last because the network broadcasting the show decided to stop producing comedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>. Martella recalled that for the final episode, the production team decided to spend "as much money as we want on this episode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>, knowing they would go over budget, but the network wouldn't be able to do anything about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:19">[01:40:19]</a>. This led to extravagant scenes, such as a shootout, which had never been done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>.

## Cultural Impact in Brazil

*Everybody Hates Chris* gained immense popularity in Brazil, much to Martella's surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He initially knew of its popularity through social media comments in Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Theories for Brazilian Success
Several theories were proposed for the show's profound [[cultural_impact_of_everybody_hates_chris_in_brazil | cultural impact in Brazil]]:
*   **Politically Incorrect Humor**: Brazilian audiences appreciate this style of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.
*   **Relatable Economic Realities**: The series' depiction of economic hardships, such as parents holding multiple jobs, resonated with many Brazilian families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.
*   **Structural Racism**: The portrayal of racism in the 1960s, despite being a satire, connected with Brazil's own history of structural racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Interracial Friendship**: The friendship between Chris and Greg, navigating racial dynamics, was relatable to Brazilian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Quality Dubbing**: The Brazilian dubbing of the series was highly praised, particularly the voice actor for Greg, Eric BGL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Memes and Phrases
The show generated several lasting cultural phenomena in Brazil:
*   **Ponte Preta Meme**: A meme emerged featuring Greg wearing a Ponte Preta jersey, a random reference to a football team from a city outside São Paulo's capital, which became a widely used reaction image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Martella received a real Ponte Preta jersey as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **"She's So Into You"**: The phrase "ela tá tão na sua" (she's so into you), originating from a scene where Chris whispers to Greg, became a popular idiom in everyday Brazilian Portuguese, extending beyond romantic contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:53">[01:50:53]</a>. Martella was initially confused by references to "danger" related to this phrase, only later understanding its cultural significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Brazilian Reception
Martella expressed gratitude for the warm reception he received in Brazil, appreciating the fans' affection and how they embraced him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. He finds it incredible that his work has meant so much to people, spanning generations, with fans now showing the series to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Potential Animated Series and Future

There is a possibility of an animated version of *Everybody Hates Chris* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Martella, a voice actor, confirmed that discussions are underway and he knows some details but cannot disclose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He explained that animation production takes a significant amount of time; for example, *Phineas and Ferb*, which he started working on in 2006, only premiered in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Similarly, any animated episode from recording to airing typically takes 10 to 11 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

Martella hopes to continue working in diverse roles, including comedy sketches, cartoons, and movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. He noted the [[challenges_of_working_in_the_entertainment_industry | difficulty of achieving success]] and the constant rejection in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, he is grateful for his career and the ability to continue entertaining audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Sarah Sheeva was born the firstborn daughter of two prominent figures in Brazilian music: Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Her father, Pepeu Gomes, is renowned as one of Brazil's greatest guitarists, even being mentioned in the *New York Times* in connection with the first Rock in Rio festival in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Brazil did not have such festivals prior to 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Sarah Sheeva was a child during this period, witnessing shows and the musical scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Her unique name, Sarah Shiva, was inspired by a desire to be different from another artist's daughter, Cosma Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. She intentionally spelled her name with an "Xereva" to avoid any links to Hinduism, as she was not Christian at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Her parents lived together for approximately 18 years and had six children, with her mother often pregnant while performing on television programs like Chacrinha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was notable at a time when Brazilian culture did not typically encourage large families, especially for a famous artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. After 18 years, her parents separated to pursue their individual solo careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Before their solo endeavors, both her parents were part of the musical movement [[Novos Baianos]], a community of artists who felt greatly oppressed by the political climate of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. They embraced an alternative movement, believing in leftism as a path to freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Despite being good and peaceful individuals, their "heavy hippie" appearance often led to negative experiences, such as being stopped on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Sarah Sheeva later understood that their rapid push for an alternative movement in a traditional era led to significant repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Sarah Sheeva's upbringing granted her immense freedom; she was never forbidden from anything or repressed by her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. They always encouraged her to choose her own destiny, pursue her career, and follow her dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This upbringing shaped her personality, leading to a strong sense of freedom that later influenced her relationship with God, as she did not project a repressive father figure onto Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. She considers her parents wonderful, acknowledging they made mistakes like any parents, but always did their best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Later in life, Sarah and her sisters formed a successful secular music band called SNZ, which stood for "Sara, Nana (her sister), and ZabelÃª (her other sister)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Her conversion process began during the early stages of this band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Two years after her own conversion, her mother also had a similar intense supernatural experience with God within a church setting, leading to the spiritual transformation of their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.

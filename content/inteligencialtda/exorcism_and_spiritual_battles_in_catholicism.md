## Understanding Evil and Spiritual Warfare
Within Catholic theology, the world is understood to be "under the yoke of the enemy," referring to the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>. While God does not inflict suffering, he allows it due to the free will granted to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. A constant [[spiritual_warfare_and_demonic_influence|spiritual battle]] between good and evil occurs for the human soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. The devil seeks to remove human freedom, consent, fervor, and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>.

Despite this, the devil is considered "tied up" at the foot of the cross, meaning Jesus' victory over evil is already won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. However, if individuals "open up" or approach the devil, they allow him to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>. The human misuse of freedom is the primary cause of the world's problems, creating "monsters" and leading to atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>.

### Devil's Targets and Human Vulnerabilities
The devil's main targets for destruction are the family and the church, as these are the two institutions that most guide human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The spirit of evil also seeks to prevent people from praying and upholding family values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>.

Individuals create "gaps" or "little holes" in their lives through various sins and compromises, allowing the enemy to enter and corrupt their foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>. Examples include pornography, drug addiction, infidelity, lying, and anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>. The devil exploits these concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

Pope Francis states that only Jesus Christ could effectively argue with the devil, and humans should "run away" from temptation rather than attempting to debate with evil spirits due to their superior angelic intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:47">[01:56:47]</a>.

## The Practice of Exorcism
[[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare|Exorcism]] is a specific practice within Catholicism where the devil manifests and takes control of a person's mental faculties, freedom, and can even disfigure them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. It is considered an "exceptional case of possession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>.

### The Role of an Exorcist
A priest cannot simply choose to be an [[concepts_of_spiritual_warfare_and_demonology_in_christianity|Exorcist]]; they require a bishop's appointment and specific specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. This role involves studying specific rites and formulas, but it is primarily a vocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>. Exorcists must maintain a "very serious" life, including frequent confession and communion, as the demon will try to expose their sins during the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:36">[01:52:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This intense spiritual battle often leads to exorcists dying young, frequently from illnesses like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.

### Personal Experiences and Church Teachings
One priest recounts witnessing and attempting an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare|exorcism]] that failed because he was not an authorized exorcist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>. He described a possessed young girl who exhibited unnatural strength, distorted voice, foaming, and self-mutilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The priest, not being an exorcist, invoked Jesus' name and asked for a truce, which the entity conceded for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>. The girl was later attended to by an authorized exorcist and her life transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>. Full deliverance can take time, sometimes years, especially if the "impregnation" of evil is deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.

The importance of filling one's life with God's presence after deliverance is emphasized, as an empty house can lead to evil returning worse than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. This is a biblical concept where simply removing evil without spiritual growth can result in a more severe state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>.

Historically, even figures like Saint John Paul II were said to have performed instantaneous exorcisms by laying on hands and praying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>. Saint Benedict, known for his prayer against evil, experienced attempts on his life where poison was miraculously averted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. These accounts reinforce the Catholic Church's tradition of spiritual warfare and the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_and_faith_in_combating_evil|role of the Catholic Church and faith in combating evil]].

## Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Spiritual Healing
In the context of dealing with [[understanding_the_psychological_effects_of_spiritual_warfare|suicidal thoughts]] and depression, spiritual guidance emphasizes that pain and wounds are real and can be healed through [[the_role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_battles|faith]] in Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. Individuals are encouraged to allow God to touch their wounds, heal their past, and focus on their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. Miracles are cited as evidence of God's healing power, with personal anecdotes of individuals recovering from dire medical prognoses through prayer and holy water, a testament to [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith|personal and supernatural experiences related to faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>.

Regarding suicide, Catholic teaching, drawing from Saint Augustine, suggests that a person going to hell is "very difficult" because it requires full awareness and a deliberate break with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>. Since 1987, the Church's canon law allows the body of a suicide to be mourned in church, acknowledging that such acts are often driven by pain and a lack of full awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:17">[02:29:17]</a>. For those who have lost loved ones to suicide, acts of reparation, such as charity or having masses said, are recommended to mitigate the severity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a>.

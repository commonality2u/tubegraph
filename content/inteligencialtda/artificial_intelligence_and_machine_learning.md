[[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) broadly encompasses anything a computer does that a human being also does, such as learning to add or playing chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. Historically, early AI, like Deep Blue, operated based on meticulously written code and pre-programmed possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

[[machine_learning_and_predictive_algorithms | Machine Learning]] (ML) is a subset of [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | AI]] focused on pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:45">[01:49:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>. Instead of explicit programming for every scenario, ML models learn by recognizing patterns in data, similar to how humans learn from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>. This allows them to perform tasks and make decisions in a more efficient and adaptable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>.

## Early Life and Childhood Games
[[personal_anecdotes_and_experiences_from_marcos_chiesa | Marcos Chiesa]] recalls a childhood filled with street games, contrasting it with the modern era of cell phones and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He remembers playing soccer with a sock ball, utilizing vacant lots, and even sliding down hills on refrigerator cardboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A peculiar childhood "war" involved castor oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He also recalls playing "taco" (a game similar to baseball) and how the game often involved retrieving balls from strict neighbors' yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Pranks and Stunts on Pânico
[[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Chiesa's journey]] into the world of pranks escalated significantly with [[pnico_show_and_experiences | Pânico]], a show known for its outrageous stunts and irreverent humor.

### Origins of the Prank Persona
Initially, Chiesa's role in Pânico was unintentional. He started in radio promotions and eventually transitioned into contributing to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. He remembers his first on-air contribution involved him giving a nonsensical opinion on marijuana legalization during a street interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:12">[02:50:12]</a>. His willingness to "talk nonsense" eventually led him to a permanent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:12">[02:54:12]</a>.

### Iconic Segments and Challenges
Pânico pushed boundaries, often putting its cast in risky or uncomfortable situations. Chiesa highlights several memorable and often dangerous segments:
*   **"Five Ways" Series**
    *   This segment involved performing various absurd tasks in five different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
    *   One notable instance was a waxing segment, where a person was pulled by a Ferrari, an "absurd thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
    *   Another involved giving a birthday gift by popping a champagne cork into a specific target, which resulted in a "disgrace" in his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
    *   A barbecue segment involved getting a tattoo, with Chiesa himself getting an "ugly" tattoo on his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **"Dwarf Burial"**
    *   One of the most controversial stunts involved simulating the burial of a dwarf, which was done by throwing him from a trampoline with paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Chiesa acknowledges this stunt was "crazy" and "almost killing someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
*   **"Coffin on Fire"**
    *   Chiesa participated in a segment where he was placed inside a coffin that was then set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Despite assurances of safety, smoke entered the coffin, causing him to choke and struggle to breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. This was a particularly frightening experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.
*   **Dangerous "Games"**
    *   Inspired by the movie *Saw*, Pânico created "deadly games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. Chiesa was subjected to a paintball shot to the forehead, mimicking the assassination of JFK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
    *   He also performed a hula hoop act with razor blades, emphasizing the extreme nature of the stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Animal-Related Stunts**
    *   Chiesa recalls a "cockroach in the head" stunt, which led to concerns from his own father about the show going too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.
    *   He also participated in an ostrich race, which ended with a woman falling and needing to go to the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.
*   **Bee Sting**
    *   In one instance, he had to endure a bee sting in his mouth, which caused his face to swell significantly, preventing him from recording the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:22">[01:33:22]</a>.
*   **Anthill Challenge**
    *   Chiesa describes sitting on an anthill while wearing pants and underwear, resulting in a severe burning sensation and a "thousand" pimple-like bumps on his buttocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>.
*   **Eating Challenges**
    *   He recounts eating unusual things like crickets, which he initially found "crunchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:27">[02:52:27]</a>. He also recalls a segment where he had to eat eyeballs, but refused to spit it out on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:53">[02:55:53]</a>. He expressed a dislike for raw fish at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:08">[02:56:08]</a>.
*   **Skydiving**
    *   Despite initially not wanting to, Chiesa jumped from a parachute as part of a stunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>. He found the experience disorienting due to the constant speed of the plane, and the parachute opening caused a temporary loss of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

### Reflecting on the Risks and Humor
Chiesa notes that many stunts were done with minimal budget and equipment, sometimes even using personal funds for cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. He reflects that the humor of Pânico often came from the genuine reactions of the cast and the "class" atmosphere among friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:35">[01:54:35]</a>. However, he also acknowledges the extreme nature of the show, admitting that some segments were "absurd" and "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### Pressure and Evolution
As Pânico grew, so did the pressure to deliver results, particularly in terms of audience ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>. This pressure sometimes led to more extreme content, which eventually caused some concern, even from Chiesa's own father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:46">[02:06:46]</a>. He noted that the dynamic changed as the show became more successful, with cast members becoming more selective about the segments they would participate in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:23">[02:09:23]</a>. Despite the challenges and risks, Chiesa states that he loved the process and the impact the show had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:19">[02:46:19]</a>. He recognizes that the show "took those [celebrity] figures off the pedestal" and revolutionized humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:53">[02:56:53]</a>.

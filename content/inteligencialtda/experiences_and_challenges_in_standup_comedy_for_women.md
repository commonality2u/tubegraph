Cris Paiva, a comedian, shares her [[personal_anecdotes_and_insights_from_a_comedians_career | experiences]] and insights into the world of standup comedy, particularly from the perspective of a woman. She is known for making jokes about her ex-husband, her role as a woman, and being a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Comedy as a "Company Without Walls"

Cris describes comedy as a "big company without walls" where comedians can easily collaborate and hire each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This structure means no one is literally accountable to another for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, this environment also means that if a comedian behaves unprofessionally, they can be effectively "burned" and cut off from working with others in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | Challenges and Experiences in the Comedy Industry]]

### Professional and Personal Integration
Cris highlights how her [[influence_of_personal_experiences_on_comedy | personal experiences]] heavily influence her comedy material. Her separation from her ex-husband became one of her "most expected" and successful texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. She struggled to find the right "tone" for this material so that the audience would laugh without pity, understanding that she herself was laughing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This process of transforming painful [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | anecdotes]] into comedy material was "liberating" for her, both professionally and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

### Navigating Male-Dominated Spaces
Cris discusses the ego dynamics within the comedy profession, especially when both partners are in the same field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. She recounts feeling "guilty of [her] victories" because her success would often be met with a "butt face" from her ex-partner, leading her to "give up invitation[s]" or try to include him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

### Perceptions and Generalizations
A significant challenge addressed is the generalization of women in comedy. If a female comedian performs poorly, the audience might conclude that "women are not good" at comedy, unlike male comedians who are judged individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This generalization hinders the growth and acceptance of female comedians in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

### The "Quota" Debate
Cris is strongly against quotas for women in comedy lineups, arguing it's a "useless" fight that seeks "space for pity" or based on gender rather than talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>. She believes that if a woman is "good on stage," she will be called regardless of gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. She points out that forcing raw or unprepared female comedians onto lineups, merely to fill a quota, actually "works against us" by reinforcing negative stereotypes about women in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.

Between us we have a mess, that's how it is, we're not famous, right? Necessarily people are not tall presentable is what I usually say to We are not presentable so it is not possible to make fun of things in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>

### Harassment and Industry Inclusion
Cris asserts that she has never experienced harassment or felt pressured to exchange favors for opportunities in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:12">[01:44:12]</a>. She feels the standup comedy environment has "always been very inclusive" and that dressing rooms were always professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. She acknowledges that some women report such experiences, but emphasizes the need to distinguish between individual cases and broader rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. She also criticizes those who use claims of victimhood for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">[01:54:53]</a>.

## New Initiatives and the Future of Women in Comedy
Cris is part of a new podcast project at Flow, which will feature two women as hosts. She stresses that the show will not be exclusively "feminine" in its content, but will offer a "different prism and another look" on various topics, welcoming all audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>. She believes in encouraging women to host their own festivals and shows, and for successful female comedians to support beginners, fostering organic growth rather than mandated quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>.

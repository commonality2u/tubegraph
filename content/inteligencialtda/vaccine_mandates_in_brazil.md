In a debate, the topic of vaccine mandates in Brazil was discussed, focusing on the stance of Jair Bolsonaro's government and the relevant legislation.

## Law 13,979 and Compulsory Vaccination
Law 13,979, signed by [[Jair Bolsonaro | Jair Bolsonaro]], mandates vaccination and grants powers to governors and mayors for compulsory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Article 3 of this law allows for the adoption of measures such as compulsory medical examinations, laboratory tests, sample collection, clinical vaccination, and other prophylactic or specific medical treatments to respond to public health emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This law is currently in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, allowing states and municipalities to implement mandatory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

## Debaters' Stances
One debater, Nicolas, explicitly stated that he does not agree with mandatory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, though he acknowledged not having read the specific law in the sense of compulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. He further clarified that if the law indeed makes vaccination mandatory, he disagrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. From a conservative perspective, Nicolas expressed belief in the primacy of the collective right over the individual right in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

The other debater, Nando, questioned why [[Jair Bolsonaro | Jair Bolsonaro]] signed a law mandating vaccination if he is supposedly against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Nando highlighted that the law states measures "may be adopted," indicating a possibility, and empowers local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. He referenced historical precedents for mandatory vaccination, such as for yellow fever in the Amazon and Africa, and for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

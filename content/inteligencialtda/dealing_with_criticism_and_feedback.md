## Early Experiences with Misidentification
The speaker recounts how his name, Pedro, was often mispronounced as "Peter" for a significant period. While initially accepting it due to long-term exposure, he eventually became annoyed by it, illustrating a personal journey of tolerating and then resisting persistent misidentification. He notes that people often mispronounced his name as "Peter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This persistent mispronunciation eventually led him to simply accept it, as he was "used to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and no longer cared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Navigating Online Criticism

### The Nature of Online Discourse
The speaker highlights the pervasive nature of online negativity, particularly on platforms like Twitter, which he describes as a "toxic and addictive network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:48">[02:51:48]</a>. He explains that online interactions often lead to misunderstandings, where people twist words and distort meaning, filling in "frames with their ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:58">[01:32:58]</a> to create false narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This environment fosters a "free war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a> where individuals are quick to attack and condemn.

### Specific Instances of Backlash
*   **Political Opinions:** The speaker faced significant backlash for expressing political views, which he describes as a "great mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>. He notes that people are prone to distorting statements, and once an opinion is given, it can be "strive[d] to distort and make it wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>, leading to accusations of being a "fascist and a sexist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>.
*   **Harley Quinn Movie Review:** His review of the *Harley Quinn* movie, where he stated it "could be better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a> but not "bad," was taken to Twitter, resulting in accusations of sexism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>.
*   **Captain Marvel Review:** Similarly, his review of *Captain Marvel* was misinterpreted, leading to false claims that he "spoke badly of Captain Marvel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a> due to the lead being a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. He clarifies that he criticized the movie, not the actress or her gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:09">[01:58:09]</a>.
*   **Robber and Dog Incident:** A personal opinion shared on G1 about a robber who apparently didn't pet a dog out of affection but out of necessity (to stop barking), led to a barrage of comments and accusations, showing how easily one can "give [their] face to slap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a> in the online space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>.
*   **Carol's Harassment Video:** He expressed regret for a video he made in 2016, which, upon re-evaluation, he found to be "harassment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>. He apologized publicly on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a> and admits he "regrets that video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>, even if some believe his apology was opportunistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:29">[01:49:29]</a>.

## Strategies for Handling Criticism

### Maintaining Authenticity and Boundaries
The speaker emphasizes the importance of authenticity and consistency in content creation. He asserts that he is a "content creator" who constantly strives to improve his product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a> and values feedback from his audience, engaging with them directly to understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. He believes that true [[criticism_of_modern_music_and_celebrity_culture | criticism]] comes from genuine engagement, not from baseless attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

### Dealing with "Cancellation"
He discusses the concept of "cancellation," noting that it truly harms a person's career when it "actually harms a person's career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>. He acknowledges that some accusations, like those of racism or homophobia, are crimes, but often these are based on misinterpretations or fabrications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. He aims to clarify misconceptions, offering to "talk to people" and show "proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a> that he is not the "villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a> some portray him to be.

> [!WARNING]

## Learning and Growth

### Adapting to Feedback
The speaker emphasizes that continuous improvement is key to his work. He actively seeks feedback from his audience, stating that improvements to his websites "were always coming from the crowd here to watch me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:29">[02:32:29]</a>. This open approach allows him to [[Personal and Professional Growth | grow]] and adapt to changing audience needs and platform algorithms.

> [!NOTE]

### Managing Expectations and Mental Health
He acknowledges the mental toll of constant online scrutiny. He mentions feeling "disgusted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a> by some negative content and notes that he has learned to distance himself from it. He also highlights the importance of not letting criticism affect [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | personal life]], mentioning how his wife, Andressa, tries to shield him from online negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. He has developed a "strategy to win back the audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:03">[03:08:03]</a> when faced with algorithmic changes or [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | challenges]].

The speaker believes that people have the right to change their views and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. He notes that "if the guy is fine why is he? will try to cancel someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>, implying that much of the negativity stems from envy. He sees his work as a source of good, helping people and making a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:27">[03:15:27]</a>.

Brazil has a rich history of reported ufological incidents, with sightings, landings, abductions, and encounters documented across various regions and time periods. The country's military and scientific institutions have also engaged with the phenomenon, sometimes leading to official investigations and, at other times, alleged cover-ups.

## Early Sightings and Abductions

Before the modern era of flying saucers, generally considered to have begun in 1947, Brazil already had reports of unidentified aerial phenomena and encounters.

*   **Pre-Modern Era Sightings** Many cases occurred before 1947, with one notable incident in December 1939 in São João del Rei, Minas Gerais, where over two thousand people observed a luminous ball making evolutions in the sky, similar to a drone [00:13:16].
*   **First Abduction Case** The first documented abduction in Brazil reportedly occurred in 1931, involving a Mr. José Florence in Campinas [01:39:59]. A researcher interviewed him, along with a Spanish researcher and a professor, who drew the creature that abducted him [01:50:49]. This case is seen as proof that the UFO phenomenon and crew encounters happened before the modern era of flying saucers [01:50:49].
*   **Indigenous Accounts** Some cases involve Brazilian indigenous peoples, such as the Kayapó tribe [01:35:56]. There are accounts from a tribe in Mato Grosso that allegedly captured and consumed alien beings after the beings began to bother tribal children [01:44:20]. These stories were collected by German and Swiss researchers in 1936 and are described in books [01:50:00]. The Kayapó tribe has a legend of a "God Bep-Kororoti" who arrived in a "bard in thunder" (likely a ship) near Serra de Botucatu [01:56:57]. This being, described as white-skinned with a beard, had a weapon that disintegrated trees [01:19:16]. He eventually married a tribal chief's daughter, had a son, and established a "school" where elders discussed experiences before leaving in his ship, promising to return [01:18:15].

## Major Ufological Incidents

### The [[Varginha UFO incident]] (1996)

The [[Varginha UFO incident]] is one of Brazil's most famous and extensively researched ufological events.

*   **Creature Description** The creature captured in [[Varginha UFO incident | Varginha]] is classified as a "Gamma" type of extraterrestrial being [01:41:52]. It had lumps on its head, red eyes, no inches, three fingers on its hands, and two cigar-shaped toes [01:42:13]. One military drawing of the creature, made by a soldier who captured it, exists and was shared by the researcher [01:41:49].
*   **Military Involvement and Cover-up** The case involved a significant military cover-up, with creatures allegedly captured and transported by the Brazilian Army [04:08:46]. The event was classified as "top secret" [04:37:35]. A police officer named Marco Eli Chereze, who reportedly captured an ET by hand, died later due to an infection from a scratch under his armpit, leading to suspicions of his involvement in the incident [04:13:30].
*   **The Group of Seven** A group of 17 researchers, known as "The Group of Seven," had unrestricted access to material related to the [[Varginha UFO incident | Varginha]] case, including testimonies from military police, fire department, and civilians [04:38:23]. Key members included Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, lawyer Vitório Pacaccini, and engineer Claudeir Covo [04:39:56]. Jamil Vila Nova, an expert in drawing, created "spoken portraits" with witnesses [04:48:51].
*   **Creature Transportation** Live and dead creatures were reportedly taken to an Army installation and then transported by train from Três Corações to Unicamp (University of Campinas) between January 23-24, 1996 [04:41:40]. Nurses and military personnel testified to seeing the creatures [04:49:55]. It is believed that the Americans later took one of the creatures, while another remained in Brazil, possibly at a base in Iperó [04:51:57].
*   **Alleged Bribery Attempt** The mothers of the girls who sighted the creature in [[Varginha UFO incident | Varginha]] reported being approached by "men in black" (individuals in suits) who offered them money and a television appearance in exchange for denying their sighting [05:08:08]. The family, however, chose to value the truth and refused the offer [05:28:46].
*   **Official Denial** The Army held a press conference to deny everything, stating that no soldier or ESA (Escola de Sargentos das Armas) resources were used for capture [05:40:08]. A police investigation attempted to dismiss the sighting by attributing it to a mentally challenged man, despite the girls' insistence that what they saw was different [05:48:51]. Researchers involved in the case received threats [05:56:07].

### [[Operation Saucer in Brazil | Operation Saucer]] (1977-1978)

[[Operation Saucer in Brazil | Operation Saucer]] was a military investigation into UFO phenomena in the Amazon region, particularly in Belém do Pará.

*   **The "Chupa-Chupa" Phenomenon** Starting in 1977, luminous objects appeared in the region, shining spotlights on riverside populations and allegedly extracting blood or bodily fluids, leaving marks [01:12:41]. This phenomenon was dubbed "Chupa-Chupa" (lollipop/vampire) and caused widespread panic [01:13:58].
*   **Military Investigation** The Brazilian Air Force, through the 1st Air Command, initiated a coordinated mission led by Captain Uyrangê Hollanda and Sergeant Flávio Costa to investigate [01:12:20]. They took over 500 photographs and cinematographic records of the luminous phenomena [01:13:18]. A report of over 500 pages was generated to explain the events [01:13:48].
*   **Migration of Phenomenon** The phenomenon, initially in Maranhão with some reported deaths, migrated to Pará and then to the Amazon region by the end of 1984, eventually crossing the border into Venezuela [01:14:47]. Similar attacks were reported in Ashaninka and other Acre tribes between 2014-2016 [01:15:13].
*   **Captain Hollanda's Suicide** Captain Uyrangê Hollanda, the head of the operation, asked for the matter to be closed [03:04:34]. His suicide is believed by some to be related to the stress of the investigation, though others suggest it was due to a pre-existing depression and a desire to reveal the secrets before his death [03:04:55].

### Official UFO Night (May 1986)

This incident marked a significant moment in Brazilian ufology due to the official recognition and military involvement.

*   **Mass Sightings** On the night of May 19-20, 1986, over 20 unidentified flying objects were detected in the skies of São Paulo, São José dos Campos, and Rio de Janeiro [05:09:51].
*   **Military Response** Brigadier Otávio Júlio Moreira Lima of the Brazilian Air Force communicated with President José Sarney to send F5 interceptor aircraft to investigate the objects, which were saturating radar systems [05:17:52]. Some pilots took off and engaged in pursuits [05:22:27].
*   **Collective Witnessing** More than two thousand military personnel, including sergeants and officers, witnessed the phenomenon at the School of Aeronautics Specialist in Guaratinguetá, which also experienced a blackout [05:26:09].
*   **International Communication** The Brazilian government communicated with the US Department of Defense about the incident [05:43:53]. Fax documents in English show details, including observations by Ozires Silva (former president of Embraer) and Commander Alcir in a Xingu aircraft [05:52:55]. The objects later crossed into Uruguay, prompting the Uruguayan government to officially request details from Brazil [05:53:35].
*   **Duration and Collection** The "Official UFO Night" lasted for ten days [05:16:16]. On May 21st, a "mother ship" reportedly appeared, collecting the smaller objects that had been seen across Brazil [05:55:18].

### Ubatuba UFO Explosion (1957)

*   **Explosion and Fragments** In 1957, an unidentified flying object exploded over Toninhas Beach in Ubatuba, a fishing village [02:16:57]. Witnesses saw the explosion [02:15:58].
*   **Physical Evidence** Fragments of the exploded object were collected and analyzed at USP (University of São Paulo) and Stanford University [02:13:15]. The analysis indicated that the fragments were composed of 99.3% pure magnesium [02:14:53]. Experts confirmed this composition is unlike any known meteorite [02:16:20].
*   **Publicity** The case was publicized in major newspapers like O Globo and later in O Cruzeiro magazine [02:17:08].

### Other Notable Incidents in Brazil

*   **Pedro de Toledo Case (1994)** A foreman named José Marlone was found dead inside his house in Pedro de Toledo in February 1994, with strange physical alterations: his hair had detached from his head, his skin resembled an eraser, and there was no putrefaction smell [02:49:02]. His clothes were not singed. Animals on the property also died or were burned in strange ways [02:50:17]. Sightings of an object had occurred in the preceding days. Police tried to take the body to Unicamp for study [02:50:41]. The death was officially undetermined, and documents related to the case disappeared from official records [02:51:35].
*   **Araçariguama Case (1946)** João Prestes Jr. was hit by a light from a window while fishing during carnival, causing his body to burn [02:53:09]. His skin began to peel off, earning it the moniker "the man who melted" [02:54:40]. He felt no pain, but his body disintegrated, and he died on the way to Sorocaba [02:55:17].
*   **Santo André Police Sighting (1987)** In August 1987, police officers in Santo André photographed a disk-shaped object with multiple colored lights [02:09:30]. The photo, resembling an X-Files image, was authenticated by photo analysts and published in a local newspaper. Many other witnesses appeared after the publication [02:27:08].
*   **Santo André Tree Interaction (2002)** On May 11, 2002, an object was seen above a tree in Santo André, projecting light rays that penetrated the vegetation [02:11:24]. Leaves from the tree showed scorching and holes, indicating a physical interaction [02:12:02].
*   **Manaus Ship Sighting (1974)** Pastor Caio Fábio and many others reported seeing a very large ship in Manaus in 1974 [02:19:37]. This region is also known for "Chupa-Chupa" attacks, similar to [[Operation Saucer in Brazil | Operation Saucer]], where lights sucked blood from riverside populations [02:20:10].
*   **Coastal Sightings** The entire Brazilian coastline, including areas like Guarujá, Ilhabela, São Sebastião, Peruíbe, and São Vicente, has a high incidence of UFO sightings [02:55:04]. This suggests the possibility of strategic underwater bases [02:02:57]. Early reports date back to 1560 with a letter from Jesuit José de Anchieta describing "Boitatá," a fiery thing that chased and sometimes killed Indians [02:46:49]. In Guarujá, a 1946 landing involved anthropomorphic beings with cat-like faces [02:47:40].
*   **Interior Sightings** Inland regions with high UFO incidence include the south of Minas Gerais (e.g., Baependi, Aiuruoca, [[Varginha UFO incident | Varginha]]), Chapada Diamantina, Chapada dos Veadeiros, Chapada dos Guimarães, the Amazon region, and areas with caves like Ribeira Valley in Iporanga [02:04:10]. Goiás, including Alexânia, Pirenópolis, and Formosa, also has frequent sightings, with petroglyphs in Formosa resembling flying saucers [02:05:32]. São Thomé das Letras in Minas Gerais is also a known hotspot [02:06:28]. The "ghost car" phenomenon, where a light follows a car on dirt roads and then disappears, is reported in Minas Gerais [02:57:40].

## Government and Military Involvement

*   **Official Investigations** In 1968, the Brazilian Air Force established an official body within the 4th Air Force Air Command in São Paulo to scientifically investigate the UFO phenomenon, generating numerous reports [01:16:23]. These reports included clinical examinations of witnesses and sketches of ships and beings [01:17:37].
*   **Document Preservation** Official documents and records related to UFOs, including police reports from Pernambuco and the Army's old Department of Internal Order (DOPS), are often moved to parallel, secret files rather than being destroyed [02:11:01]. These documents sometimes use coded terms like "Hotel Traffic" to refer to UFOs [01:19:40].
*   **National Archive** Records and audios of military interceptions from events like the Official UFO Night are now available to the public at the National Archive in Brasília [05:19:07]. However, the release of documents has been limited to "the tip of the iceberg" [01:16:04].
*   **Presidential Awareness** Presidents are reportedly informed about ufological cases [04:49:13]. Dilma Rousseff, for example, was said to be informed about ongoing events [04:57:41].
*   **Military Cover-ups** Military forces often cover up UFO incidents to prevent public panic and to secretly study the technology for reverse engineering, aiming for military dominance [04:59:21]. This is believed to be the reason why many current technologies, such as cell phones, medical ultrasound, and stealth planes, might be based on alien technology recovered from UFO crashes [00:59:07].

## Types of Beings and Phenomena

Ufology classifies observed beings and phenomena into different categories:

*   **Contact Degrees**
    *   **1st Degree**: Sighting of lights or objects [03:35:35].
    *   **2nd Degree**: Physical marks left on the ground, electromagnetic interference, power blackouts, animal mutilations, skin burns, or landing marks [03:49:51].
    *   **3rd Degree**: Sighting of the crew member, with or without the UFO [03:19:19].
    *   **4th Degree**: Abductions, where a person is taken aboard a ship [03:46:46].
    *   **5th Degree**: Communication, mostly telepathic, but sometimes in the abductee's local language [03:53:07].

*   **Being Classifications**
    *   **Alpha (Greys)**: Short (1.5m), large heads, disproportionate, often with big black eyes [03:46:46]. They are the most common type reported in abductions, accounting for about 80% of cases [03:26:07].
    *   **Betas**: Human-like in appearance, often with more beautiful features like blonde hair and blue eyes, sometimes disproportionately tall (2-2.5m) [04:16:29]. They account for about 15% of cases [04:09:00].
    *   **Gammas**: Beings with entire bodies covered in hair or robotic, including the [[Varginha UFO incident | Varginha ET]] [04:11:13]. They account for 5% of cases [04:09:00].

*   **Other Phenomena**
    *   **Chupacabra/Animal Mutilations**: Creatures that drain all blood from animals and remove internal organs (e.g., tongue, brain) through small, cauterized holes [02:21:05]. First reported in Puerto Rico, then spread to other South American countries like Argentina and Brazil in the 1990s [02:22:02].
    *   **Dormitory Visitations**: A modern form of abduction where the object is near or on a house, and the person is abducted while sleeping, sometimes transported through walls or roofs [02:26:55].
    *   **Luminous Phenomena**: Often observed at night, these are usually ionized air around the propulsion system of the ship, rather than the solid object itself [02:20:46].
    *   **Crop Circles**: While often attributed to extraterrestrials, most crop circles are man-made by "cycle makers" who compete to create complex designs [01:59:02]. However, genuine landing marks can occur in plantations [02:00:22].

## Ufology as a Field of Study

Ufology in Brazil operates as a "para-science" as it is difficult to measure and reproduce its phenomena [01:16:04]. Researchers emphasize the importance of physical evidence, such as UFO fragments [02:07:26], and rigorous analysis to distinguish genuine sightings from known objects like drones, satellites (e.g., Elon Musk's Starlink), weather balloons, or atmospheric phenomena [01:11:16].

The media's perception of ufology has unfortunately often been to trivialize or make fun of it, denigrating its image [01:57:51]. However, there is an ongoing effort to revitalize and legitimize the field by focusing on scientific research and quality information [01:57:17].

## Theories on UFO Origins

Various theories exist to explain the origins of UFOs and their occupants:

*   **Extraterrestrial**: The most common theory, suggesting beings come from other planets [01:16:04].
*   **Intraterrestrial**: Beings from within Earth [01:16:04].
*   **Interdimensional**: Beings from other dimensions or parallel universes [01:16:04].
*   **Time Travelers**: The theory that some "aliens" are actually future humans who have evolved (e.g., big heads, atrophied organs) and are traveling back in time for studies, possibly related to genetic problems [03:25:02].
*   **Secret Military Projects**: Unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) could also be secret spy drones or advanced military aircraft developed by Earth nations, such as the triangular stealth ships seen during the Gulf War, which were later identified as US military technology [01:11:31].

## Introduction to Occultism
Occultism refers to hidden or esoteric knowledge and practices, which are not inherently dark or evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. It is distinct from exoteric knowledge, which is for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Many significant works in pop culture, including comics and songs, contain layers of occult meaning, often intended as a "code for those who are initiated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## Science and Spirituality: A Historical Intertwining
Historically, science and spirituality were deeply connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Figures considered fathers of modern medicine, like Paracelsus, were alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. The very symbol of medicine, the Caduceus, reflects elements found in Eastern yoga and Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. Many great scientists and politicians were initiates in various occult traditions:
*   Benjamin Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>
*   Isaac Newton (a Rosicrucian and Freemason) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>
*   Thomas Edison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>

These individuals sought inspiration and knowledge from kabbalistic and hermetic traditions, believing in a world connected to ours, often referred to as the astral plane or Plato's world of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

### The Role of the Catholic Church in Separation
The separation of science and spirituality became pronounced with the rise of the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. The church, rooted in the Roman Vespasian family (specifically Flavia Domitilla and later Emperor Constantine), actively repressed and "demonized" practices that were once considered normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This repression led to such practices being termed "occult" (hidden) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

The Catholic Church also:
*   Forged many things, leveraging existing archetypes and mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. An example is the papal mitre, which resembles the hat worn by Philistine priests of the god Dagon, a deity of agriculture and fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.
*   Manipulated religious narratives to control masses, particularly the rebellious Jewish population during the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. This involved crafting a "docile Christ" who advocated peace and love, contrasting with a more revolutionary historical Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.
*   Incorporated pagan customs and festivals like Christmas (Winter Solstice) and Easter (related to Eostre/Ostara, a Germanic goddess of spring and fertility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>. The Easter egg and rabbit symbols are derived from pagan fertility rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>.

## The Nature of Satan and Demons in Religious Texts

### Satan: From Adversary to Evil Entity
The concept of Satan as an evil entity is largely a later development in religious thought.
*   **Early Biblical Texts:** In the oldest parts of the Bible (e.g., Numbers 22:22, 1 Samuel 29), "Satan" (Hebrew: *lessat√£*) simply means "opponent" or "adversary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This term could refer to an angel of God placed as an obstacle to Balaam or King David himself being seen as an adversary by the Philistines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Babylonian Exile:** After the Jewish exile in Babylon (586 BCE), where they encountered Zoroastrianism, a dualistic religion with a good god and an evil god <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, the concept of Satan began to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
    *   In books like Job and Zechariah, "Satan" (Hebrew: *hasatan*) emerges as an entity, but still subordinate to God, acting as an accuser or a tester of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   In later texts, such as 1 Chronicles 21, Satan is first depicted as a figure *separated from God* and inciting evil, like prompting David to conduct a census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. However, an earlier account of the same event in 2 Samuel 24 attributes the census to "the wrath of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This highlights a shift in narrative influenced by dualistic concepts.

### Demons: From Spirits of Nature to Evil Entities
The modern understanding of "demon" as an evil entity is also a later development:
*   **Greek "Daimon":** For the ancient Greeks, "daimon" referred to intelligences or spirits in nature, including benevolent ones (e.g., Socrates's inspiring daemon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. "Caco Daimons" were negative spirits, but they were understood as necessary for balance and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Catholic Demonization:** The Catholic Church, during its expansion, intentionally demonized figures from Greek culture and paganism. For example, the Greek god Pan, a faun or satyr, was depicted with horns and a tail, becoming a visual representation of the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:07]</a>. The Greek word "daimon" was reinterpreted as "demon" to denote an evil entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## The Figure of Lucifer

The name Lucifer is commonly misunderstood:
*   **Biblical Origin (Isaiah 14):** In the Bible, the name "Lucifer" appears only once in the Old Testament, specifically in Isaiah 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. It is a mistranslation by Saint Jerome from Hebrew into Vulgar Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. The original Hebrew refers to "helel ben shahar," meaning "morning star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. The passage is a prophetic allegory about the fall of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, comparing his arrogance and downfall to the planet Venus (the morning star) which "falls from heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.
*   **Greco-Roman Deity:** Outside the Bible, in Greco-Roman mythology, "Luxiferos" or "Lucifer" was the "bearer of light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. He was the son of the god Apollo and the goddess Aurora, associated with the planet Venus, representing love, passion, evolution, beauty, and seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. Ancient Greek wedding songs (epithalamia) even invoked Lucifer to bless the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

## Ancient Civilizations and Spiritual Beliefs

Early human societies, particularly nomadic ones, saw divinity in the feminine and in nature, as women brought forth life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:12">[02:44:12]</a>. The matriarch was often the spiritual leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:54">[02:44:54]</a>. Human sacrifices, common in some ancient cultures, were seen as offerings of the "best grain" (the best young people) to Mother Earth to ensure continued abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:03">[02:45:03]</a>. This era is associated with the goddess Isis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.

With the advent of settled societies and private property, the patriarchal period emerged, with concepts like inherited lineage and monogamy, which were social constructs rather than religious ones, designed to maintain inheritance lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:11">[02:46:11]</a>. This era saw the rise of male deities and the worship of the sun, which symbolically "died" each day and was "resurrected," leading to myths of rebirth and sacrifice, like the Egyptian myth of Osiris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:18">[02:47:18]</a>.

## Solomon and Ancient Magic

King Solomon, famed for his wisdom and wealth, is deeply connected to the history of occultism.
*   **Solomon's Temple:** The First Temple, built by Solomon on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, was said to house the Ark of the Covenant and various mysterious texts and treasures collected by Solomon from Babylonian magicians and other traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>. This site is considered an "axis mundi," the first stone from which the world was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>.
*   **Control of Entities:** Islamic and Jewish traditions (like the Quran and Talmud) record Solomon's ability to speak with animals and control "djinns" (genii, akin to the Greek Daimons), using these entities to achieve incredible feats, such as transporting the Queen of Sheba's throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:35">[02:08:35]</a>. The Talmud states that Solomon invoked "models" (demons with wisdom in mathematics and language) to obtain a magic worm called Samir, which silently cut the stones for the Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:31">[02:11:31]</a>.
*   **Goetia and Occult Books:** The *Goetia* (or *Clavicula Salomonis*), a collection of pseudepigraphic books attributed to Solomon, compiles ancient papyri supposedly found under Solomon's Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>. These texts describe rituals to invoke various spirits (often ancient Canaanite gods demonized by later traditions) for various purposes, including prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:24">[02:12:24]</a>.

### The Number 666 and Solomon
The number 666, often associated with the Antichrist, is kabbalistically linked to Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>. It represents the amount of gold Solomon received annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>. In Kabbalah, 666 is associated with Tiphareth, a solar element, and the number 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. The hexagram (Star of David), a six-pointed star, is a powerful hermetic symbol with six triangles, six points, and six angles, representing the balance of masculine and feminine, light and darkness, conscious and unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:09">[01:48:09]</a>. Achieving the balance represented by the hexagram is the goal of a true magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:36">[01:49:36]</a>.

## Occultism in Pop Culture and Modern Societies

Many modern artists and public figures have ties to occult traditions, often drawing from or alluding to their symbols and philosophies:
*   **Alan Moore:** A Thelemite, his works like *V for Vendetta*, *Watchmen*, and *From Hell* are rich with occult symbolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. *V for Vendetta* explores Chaos Theory and societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Musicians and Bands:**
    *   **The Beatles:** Influenced by Aleister Crowley (featured on their *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover) and Eastern mysticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. John Lennon, in particular, was interested in Golden Dawn and Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Led Zeppelin:** Jimmy Page, the guitarist, was a devotee of Crowley, even purchasing Crowley's Boleskine House near Loch Ness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. He reportedly performed the [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | Abramelin ritual]] there, which aims to achieve communion with one's [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | Holy Guardian Angel]] by confronting inner shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a>. The band's iconic symbols on their fourth album are derived from occult texts like *Dragon Rouge* and the *Infernal Dictionary* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:02">[02:37:02]</a>. The band's success came at a cost, with personal tragedies linked to their occult practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Rolling Stones:** Also known for their interest in occultism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Pop Artists:** Madonna, Katy Perry (whose "Dark Horse" video contains strong Illuminati and Eye of Horus symbolism), Beyonc√©, and Jay-Z (a self-proclaimed member of certain orders) use occult symbols in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. These artists are often [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | Thelemites]] or influenced by Golden Dawn and Hermetic societies, incorporating symbols like the pyramid with an eye or the "Tom is Chinnate" sign (a fire sign in Kabbalah associated with creativity and intuition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Brazilian Artists:** Raul Seixas was a prominent Thelema enthusiast in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Matu√™'s songs allude to Thelemic rituals with numbers like 777 and 666 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Royal Families:** The British Royal Family, for example, has historical ties to occultism. John Dee, a mathematician and astrologer, was a spiritual advisor to Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Dee studied Kabbalah and aimed to use magic to expand the British Empire, even performing coronation rituals in places like New York's Multishot Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. His ritualistic objects are preserved in the British Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>.
*   **Cartoons and Popular Culture:**
    *   **Naruto:** Represents the work of a wizard controlling his "inner beast" (Kyubi), which is a metaphor for integrating one's unconscious and shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:02">[03:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Snow White:** The seven dwarves represent the seven vices and virtues or the seven chakras that Snow White (the virginal unconscious) must work through to achieve wisdom and balance, awakened by the "kiss" of conscious Logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:31">[03:05:31]</a>.
    *   **Walt Disney:** Was a 33rd-degree Freemason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:32">[03:07:32]</a>, a grade associated with the 33 vertebrae of the spine that connect the conscious (crown) to the unconscious (base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:38">[03:07:38]</a>. His films contain many kabbalistic and archetypal elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Modern Age: The Aion of Horus
The world is currently in the "Aion of Horus," an astrological era marked by the integration of spirituality and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:43">[02:48:43]</a>. This era encourages individuals to find God and balance within themselves, breaking from past patriarchal, tyrannical, and religiously conservative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:16">[02:50:16]</a>. This shift, however, brings chaotic elements and confrontations as society adjusts to newfound freedoms and the breakdown of old structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>.

Brazil's engagement with international politics and its global relationships are complex, involving diplomatic ties, economic policies, and geopolitical concerns. Discussions often touch upon foreign influence, trade agreements, and environmental diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Key Relationships and Influences

### United States
Brazil maintains a significant relationship with the United States, which has been a topic of discussion regarding alleged interference in [[brazils_political_landscape_and_electoral_politics | Brazilian politics and electoral processes]].
*   **Electoral Interference Allegations** Mike Benz, a notable figure, has claimed that American entities, particularly USAID, sent money to Brazil through partnerships with the TSE (Superior Electoral Court) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>. This funding was purportedly used for press indoctrination and judicial reform, aiming to influence the [[brazils_political_landscape_and_electoral_politics | Brazilian political landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. Benz even suggested that without USAID, Jair Bolsonaro might still be the president of Brazil, indicating clear external interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Bolsonaro's Stance and US Policy** Former President Bolsonaro maintained a close relationship with former US President Donald Trump, noting Trump's "great affection" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:44">[01:49:44]</a>. During Trump's presidency, there were discussions and negotiations regarding steel tariffs and corn ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>. Bolsonaro also noted that anyone attempting to escape the dollar standard, like current President Lula has suggested, would face 100% tariffs from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.
*   **Visa Policy** During Bolsonaro's administration, Brazil implemented visa exemptions for Canadian, Australian, American, and Japanese citizens to encourage tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:45">[05:54:45]</a>. However, the Lula government revoked these exemptions for Canadian, Australian, and American citizens, though not for Japanese, leading to a projected loss of thousands of tourists and millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. The Brazilian Senate has since moved to revoke Lula's decision regarding American visas, indicating a potential reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

### China
China's interest in Brazil and its influence in the country's politics and economy have also been highlighted.
*   **Agreements and Influence** Eduardo Bolsonaro expressed concerns about Chinese interest in removing him from the presidency of the Foreign Relations and National Defense Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. This concern stems from Lula's signing of 37 agreements and memoranda of understanding with Chinese President Xi Jinping, including areas like satellite communication, uranium reserves, and partnerships with China Media Group, which is seen as a form of "soft power" to indoctrinate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. These agreements raise questions of national sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

### Other Countries
*   **Venezuela** The discussion around the printed vote in Brazil draws parallels to Venezuela, where a printed vote system led to the conclusion that an election was won by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. However, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro then declared opposition figures ineligible for 15 years due to "antidemocratic acts," which involved criticizing Maduro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Paraguay** Paraguay is cited as an example of an electoral system that is "better than Venezuela," where voters can press a button, print a paper receipt, and verify their vote, with public recounts available upon suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. This system allows for transparency and accountability in electoral processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>.
*   **Israel** In a conversation about an alleged coup plot, an Israeli colleague reportedly asked about a "stunt that Mossad didn't know about," implying that Israeli intelligence would typically be aware of such plans, indicating no real danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **France (Macron)** Bolsonaro recounted telling French President Emmanuel Macron that he would discuss environmental issues with him "when your rivers have riparian forest," criticizing European countries for lacking moral authority on environmental matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:57">[03:03:57]</a>.

## Global Issues and Brazil's Role

### Environmental Geopolitics
Brazil's environmental policy, particularly concerning the Amazon and Pantanal, draws international attention.
*   **Conservation and NGOs** Bolsonaro highlighted that Brazil preserves two-thirds of its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:09">[03:04:09]</a>. He expressed a desire to create a fee for NGOs, believing "the vast majority works against Brazil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:19">[03:04:19]</a>. He cited an example from the Anomame region where a FUNAI employee earned more from other sources and worked to prevent the creation of ties between indigenous communities and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:33">[03:04:33]</a>. He also criticized NGOs for not being concerned about the future of indigenous people, citing cases where indigenous people lost jobs and were forced to work in landfills due to land demarcation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:19">[03:06:19]</a>.
*   **Pantanal Fires** The increase in fires in the Pantanal is attributed to the ending of the "firefighter ox" practice, where cattle grazing helped clear organic mass that becomes fuel for fires, leading to larger blazes when they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:51">[03:07:51]</a>.
*   **Resource Management** Brazil imports fertilizers from indigenous reserves in Canada, while having its own large fertilizer reserves in the Rio Madeira region, which cannot be explored due to indigenous reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:56">[03:06:56]</a>.

### Trade and Economic Policy
*   **Fuel Taxation** Bolsonaro pointed out that his government zeroed federal taxes on fuels, reducing the tax burden by nearly R$40 billion per year, which was then returned by the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:15">[02:55:15]</a>.
*   **Import Taxes** His administration also zeroed import taxes on various items like solar energy equipment and games, and significantly lowered taxes on other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>. The current government has returned to charging these taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:47">[02:55:47]</a>.
*   **Administrative Spending** Bolsonaro's government was the first since re-democratization to reduce administrative spending, revoking around 20,000 commission cases, a number that has now nearly doubled to 30,000 under the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.

### Electoral Process and Foreign Relations
*   **Critiques of the Electoral System** Bolsonaro has consistently defended the printed vote since 2012, when an amendment he presented was approved and became law, only to be later deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. He argues that the current electronic voting system lacks transparency, unlike systems in countries like Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>.
*   **Campaign Restrictions** During the 2022 election, Bolsonaro faced restrictions on what he could display in his campaign, such as images from September 7th or images of Lula defending abortion or commenting on cell phone theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>. Meanwhile, the TSE allegedly spent money on a campaign encouraging 16- and 17-year-olds to register to vote, an age group estimated to vote 75% for the left, which contributed over 2 million votes to Lula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>. These measures are seen as heavy-handed influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:05">[02:24:05]</a>.

## Diplomatic Context and Perspectives

Bolsonaro generally perceives the current political climate as a concerted effort against the right, where "everything is tempting against democracy" when criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. He also noted that if he were to be arrested, he fears for his life, believing he would be a "stock" for his opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:21">[02:07:21]</a>.

Eduardo Bolsonaro, currently on leave from his parliamentary position to reside in the United States, believes he is "much more useful for Brazil" there to combat injustice and curb the momentum of "dictators" like Alexandre de Moraes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. His presence in the US allows him to engage with American authorities and raise awareness about political persecution in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Tarcísio de Freitas, Governor of São Paulo, emphasizes an institutional relationship with the federal government and the Supreme Federal Court (STF) to defend São Paulo's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:57">[02:35:57]</a>. He cites examples of successfully defending state laws and projects in the STF, including land regularization, civic-military schools, and privatizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>. He also highlighted the importance of securing BNDES credit for major works by listing them in the PAC (Growth Acceleration Program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:25">[02:36:25]</a>. He affirms his loyalty to Bolsonaro as his candidate, even "underwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:04">[02:38:04]</a>.

Jerusalem is described as the most impactful city in human history and the city of faith, with over 4,000 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It is considered the cradle of civilizations, central to the ancient world's Hittites, Egyptians, and Mesopotamians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The city is a reference for all monotheistic traditions, influencing over 4 billion people, and is seen as fundamental to the Abrahamic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. If one had to choose a single city to understand humanity, it would be Jerusalem due to its historical significance, marking the beginning of human history in its vicinity and serving as the cradle for what would become Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Historical Timeline and Dominance

*   **Early History (c. 2000-1800 BCE)**: The city was initially known as Salem and had a king named Melchizedek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. An archaeological site in the southern part of Jerusalem, in the City of David, may refer to this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Abraham recognized Melchizedek as a priest of the Most High God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Jebusite Period**: After Abraham's time, Jerusalem was occupied by the Jebusites and became known as the City of Jebus or Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The oldest Hebrew papyrus bearing Jerusalem's name dates from the 10th-8th century BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Israelite Monarchy (10th Century BCE)**: When Israel occupied Canaan, Jerusalem was not initially conquered by Joshua or the judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. King Saul also coexisted with the Jebusites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. King David conquered the Jebusite fortress in the 10th century BCE and purchased the threshing floor of Araunah, which tradition holds as the site where Abraham sacrificed Isaac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. King Solomon later built his palace and the First Temple on this site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Destruction and Rebuilding**:
    *   In 587 or 586 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the First Temple and the city, leading to the Babylonian captivity of the Israelites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   In 538 BCE, the Persians gained power and allowed the Jews to return and reconstruct Jerusalem during Nehemiah's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Hellenistic and Roman Periods**: Jerusalem was conquered during the Hellenistic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The Hasmonean period (c. 100 BCE) saw provisional Jewish independence until Pompey of Rome dominated Jerusalem in 64 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   King Herod, though hated by the Jews as he was only half-Jewish, ruled the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
    *   In 70 CE, Jerusalem was again destroyed by the Romans, and Jews were prohibited from living in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   During the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 CE), Emperor Hadrian ordered the construction of a Pagan Temple to Jupiter in Jerusalem and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina, also renaming the region "Palestine" (from Philistine) to provoke the Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Byzantine and Islamic Periods**:
    *   During the Byzantine period, under Constantine, Jerusalem became Christianized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
    *   In 638 CE, Muslims took Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. The Dome of the Rock was later built, as Islamic tradition believes Muhammad ascended to heaven from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Crusades and Ottoman Rule**:
    *   The Crusades (starting around 1000 CE) saw Christians attempting to reclaim Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Jerusalem remained under Crusader control from 1099 to 1187 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
    *   The Mamluk period followed, then the Ottoman period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The Ottomans dominated Jerusalem from 1517 to 1917 (400 years), making them the longest rulers of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Modern Era**:
    *   Following the Ottoman Empire's decline and defeat in WWI, the British mandate began in 1917, lasting 30 years until 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
    *   In 1948, the State of Israel was created, allowing Jews to return to the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
    *   The Six-Day War in 1967 further shaped the city's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Jerusalem's Importance to Different Faiths

*   **Judaism**:
    *   Jerusalem is the city where Jews want to be because of the promise that the Temple will one day be rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
    *   The Temple Mount, or Mount Moriah, is considered the most sacred place for a Jew to be buried, facing Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:02">[03:10:02]</a>. It is where the presence of God was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
    *   Jews have consistently wanted to live in peace and coexist with Christians and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

*   **Christianity**:
    *   Jerusalem is emblematic for the entire Christian tradition as the city where Jesus died, resurrected, and ascended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
    *   Christians, like Jews, hold the hope for future events, including the Messiah's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

*   **Islam**:
    *   Jerusalem is the third holiest city in Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
    *   The Dome of the Rock (built around 690 CE) is believed to be the site from which Muhammad ascended to heaven in a dream to meet with prophets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
    *   Muslim tradition believes Jesus is a prophet who will return to Jerusalem to execute the Final Judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This belief has led to the establishment of a large Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem, as they expect the resurrection there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   While Jerusalem is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, its sacred status is based on post-Quranic traditions (hadith) linking Muhammad's miraculous night journey to the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:20">[02:08:20]</a>.

## Conflicts and Disputes

Jerusalem has been a site of countless wars and fights throughout history, often resulting in the destruction of its structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The entire world has a vested interest in Jerusalem, with everyone having an opinion on its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Control and Sovereignty
Jerusalem is geographically located in a very privileged and strategic position, elevated at approximately 800 meters, with cultivable land and the wonderful Gihon water source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:19">[02:11:19]</a>. Control of Jerusalem and Megiddo grants strategic logistical dominance of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:19">[02:11:19]</a>.

David Ben-Gurion, founder of modern Israel, emphasized that "without Jerusalem, there is no Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
The central question of who arrived first is a point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>.
*   **Jewish Claim**: Jews arrived first, before Christians and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. They purchased land and developed agriculture, unlike other invaders who came to dominate and extract resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:59">[02:06:59]</a>.
*   **Palestinian Identity**: Modern Palestinians are not descendants of the ancient Philistines, despite the region being renamed Palestine by Hadrian to provoke the Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:21">[01:52:21]</a>.

### International Recognition of Capital
While Israel states its capital is Jerusalem, many countries do not recognize this, often maintaining their embassies in Tel Aviv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>. This international stance is influenced by the opposition from militant Muslim groups and geopolitical reasons, including oil interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

### Religious Coexistence vs. Exclusion
Within Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock area, administered by Muslims, prohibits Jews from entering with religious items like a kippah or Christians with a crucifix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.
However, Israel is described as a country open to everyone, respecting Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, and Catholic places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>. The diversity is evident in the fact that 62 languages are spoken in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.

### Anti-Semitism
The article touches upon the historical context of anti-Semitism, describing it as a hatred against Jewish ethnicity, originally based on poorly founded religious and theological reasons that later became racial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:32">[01:40:32]</a>.
*   **Christian Anti-Semitism**: Christianity has a history of theological anti-Semitism, contributing to the idea that being Christian meant "not being Jewish." Jews were falsely accused of murdering God, leading to centuries of persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:05">[01:59:05]</a>. This manifested in events like the Inquisition, where the cross became a symbol of oppression for Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:05">[01:59:05]</a>.
*   **Nazism**: While Hitler is a prominent figure in anti-Semitism, his propaganda built upon existing European anti-Semitism that had been philosophically and scientifically explained long before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. Jews were described as a "corrosive and destructive plague" in academic and philosophical circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:41">[02:22:41]</a>.
*   **Persecution**: Jews have faced expulsion from numerous places, including Spain, Portugal, and even Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>. Proportionally, they suffered more oppression and for much longer than African populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>. One-third of Jews were eliminated during Nazism alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:32">[02:20:32]</a>.

### The Problem of Evil (Theodicy)
The Holocaust deeply impacted the discussion of the problem of evil in contemporary Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:32">[02:53:32]</a>. While some scholars find it "obscene" to explain the death of millions of innocent children through retributive justice, studies show that faith among Holocaust survivors largely remained intact or even deepened, indicating that suffering did not diminish belief for those who already had it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:32">[02:53:32]</a>.

## Modern Israel and Future Expectations

Despite its small size (comparable to Sergipe, Brazil) and 63% desert territory, modern Israel, founded in 1948 by UN vote, has seen extraordinary development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:13">[02:16:13]</a>. Survivors of the Holocaust, many arriving with nothing, transformed the desert into fertile land, inventing innovations like cherry tomatoes and drip irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:22">[02:05:22]</a>. This success is attributed to a mindset rooted in biblical wisdom, fostering technology, science, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>.

Jerusalem holds a special place in the heart of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>. Both Jewish and Christian traditions anticipate future events centered on Jerusalem, such as the rebuilding of the Temple and the return of the Messiah to the Mount of Olives for the inauguration of the Kingdom of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:44">[01:56:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### The Bible and Archaeology
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1948, precisely the year of Israel's founding, provided crucial validation for the accuracy of biblical texts. Comparing the Isaiah scroll (dated 270 BCE) with later texts showed minimal differences, proving the faithful preservation of the Hebrew Bible by Jewish copyists over millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. These discoveries illuminate the Jewish world of the first century, providing a deeper understanding of both the Old and New Testaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:10">[03:42:10]</a>.

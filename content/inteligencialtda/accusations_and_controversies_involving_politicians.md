This article details a debate between Nando and Nicolas, moderated by Rogério Vilera, which primarily focuses on accusations and [[controversies and criticisms faced by Bolsonaro | criticisms faced by Bolsonaro]] and the current state of Brazilian politics, including specific allegations against the participants.

## Introduction to the Debate
The debate, hosted by Rogério Vilera, aims to discuss the current state of Brazil, particularly in comparison to the previous decade of PT governance and the subsequent "hope of the right" with [[jair_bolsonaros_political_controversies_and_legal_challenges | Bolsonaro's]] administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Key ground rules for the debate include timed interruptions and prohibitions against personal attacks like "finger in the eye" or cursing mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Questions from the audience are collected via Super Chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## State of Brazil: Optimism vs. Pessimism
Nicolas opens by stating that a conservative is inherently skeptical, needing to do the right thing without expecting guaranteed success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. He believes Brazilians must be optimistic and hopes for the country's restructuring post-pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He attributes significant job losses (e.g., over 100,000 in Belo Horizonte) to "stay at home" campaigns during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Nicolas asserts that the worst legacy of past left-wing governments was the moral decline and destruction of "an entire generation in the field of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Nando counters that the day-to-day reality for Brazilians, including gasoline prices, is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. He immediately pivots to personal accusations, citing the commandment "you will not bear false witness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Nicolas's Trip to Dubai
Nando accuses Nicolas of lying about his trip to Dubai, specifically regarding the use of public money and vaccination requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Nando claims Nicolas shared a video implying he used public funds and was vaccinated to go to Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. He also alleges Nicolas tried to "scam a Sheikh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

Nicolas vehemently denies these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. He states he used his own resources and that his salary, as a public servant, is public money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. He asserts that he visited Expo Dubai to learn and connect with various business and government officials, including the Vice President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He claims the trip was for knowledge acquisition, similar to what a businessman does to bring benefits to his city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. He further states that the Belo Horizonte City Council confirmed he did not use public funds for the trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. He also points out that there was no vaccination requirement for Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## COVID-19 Response and Vaccines
Nando challenges Nicolas on his stance regarding mandatory vaccination, citing Law 13,979, signed by [[jair_bolsonaros_political_controversies_and_legal_challenges | Jair Bolsonaro]], which mandates vaccines and grants powers to governors and mayors to enforce vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. He claims Nicolas "lied" about vaccines and confused immunological memory with neutralizing antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Nando also questions if Nicolas would recommend chloroquine, ivermectin, or nebulization to his own mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Nicolas states he does not agree with mandatory vaccination, viewing it as taking away personal freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. He admits he hadn't read the specific law cited by Nando but maintains his disagreement with mandatory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. He emphasizes that the law uses "may be adopted" (possibility) and gives power to mayors and governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. He defends his previous statements on vaccine risks, citing Pfizer's contract putting "100% of the responsibility for the collateral effects" on the Brazilian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

Regarding COVID-19 management, Nando criticizes Bolsonaro for not buying vaccines when offered and for spreading chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. He also highlights that Nelson Teich was dismissed from the Health Ministry for disagreeing with chloroquine and that Bolsonaro was "unable to care neither about the economy nor about the economy and not even of people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

Nicolas argues that autonomy for states and municipalities was withdrawn from the president, implying that governors and mayors were responsible for lockdowns and economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. He cites positive economic indicators during Bolsonaro's administration, such as a 69.7% increase in the Brazilian trade balance in April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, the creation of 60,000 jobs in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>, and GDP retracting only 4.1% in 2020 despite forecasts of a 10% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. He also mentions the emergency aid benefiting 64 million Brazilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

## Economic and Administrative Policies
Nando claims that infrastructure investment in Brazil is the smallest since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. He states that the country's currency has depreciated the most in the world, GDP has fallen the most, and inflation is the second highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. He criticizes Bolsonaro for increasing his own salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>, proposing a "pitiful" tax reform, a "lousy" administrative reform, and wanting to "blow up the roof of spending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. He also states that only 5% of the Pronamp credit program for small and medium businesses reached them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Nicolas counters that the "Economic Freedom Car" was a "hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. He cites the "largest infrastructure plan in the history of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. He argues that the president is not solely to blame for economic issues, as the Congress and Senate must approve reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>.

## Judicial and Corruption Allegations
Nando accuses Bolsonaro of several crimes:
*   Administrative advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>
*   Liability for breach of sanitary measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>
*   Charlatanism for promoting chloroquine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>
*   Money laundering related to Flávio Bolsonaro's "panettone shop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   Concealment of assets (14 properties purchased with cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>
*   Formation of a gang with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>
*   Interfering with the Federal Police, leading to dismissals of delegates investigating his allies and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   Sanctioning laws related to the electoral fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>, the "judge of guarantees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>, and the "abuse of authority" law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>.
*   Sanctioning the possibility of lawyers being paid by the Electoral Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>.
*   Sanctioning the change of COAF to the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.

Nicolas responds by calling these "hypotheses" and "lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>. He cites Sergio Moro's statement that Bolsonaro did not interfere in the Federal Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. He argues that the judge of guarantees only specializes the judicial phase for police inquiry, not creating a new instance, and that it has existed in some form for 20 years in BH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>. He defends the COAF transfer to the Central Bank as providing autonomy and removing political pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>. Regarding corruption, Nicolas states that Bolsonaro "does not commit acts of corruption" and stops the "source of corruption," citing Petrobras's turnaround from loss to profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He also states that any citizen can report a crime of responsibility to the Chamber of Deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

## Political Alliances and Ideology
Nando criticizes Bolsonaro for aligning with the "Centrão," stating he "sold his soul" and is with "the worst bandits" in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. He points out that Bolsonaro sanctioned 349 guidelines with the PT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a> and is now with Valdemar da Costa Neto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>. Nando accuses Bolsonaro of betraying his campaign promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>. He also claims that Bolsonaro's "artificial interest policy" is the same as Ciro Gomes's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. Nando also mentions that the founder of "Escola Sem Partido" (Non-Partisan School) believes Bolsonaro "betrayed us" on the issue of ideological indoctrination in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>.

Nicolas argues that Bolsonaro has to work with the "raw material" of the elected Congress and Senate, and that political alliances are necessary for governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>. He criticizes Nando for aligning with "leftist people" and figures like Artur do Val (pro-abortion, drug legalization) and Ciro Gomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>, while simultaneously criticizing Bolsonaro for pragmatism. He refers to the MBL (Movimento Brasil Livre) as being "with Ciro Gomes" and involved in an impeachment protocol with the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. He states that the MBL also criticized Bolsonaro for not knowing how to talk but then congratulated him for "leaving ideology aside" to achieve governability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. Nicolas claims that Bolsonaro, in his view, revived the left in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.

## Character and Personal Attacks
The debate includes numerous [[controversies and issues around dark humor | personal attacks]] and insults.
*   Nando calls Nicolas a "liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, a "failed rocker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>, and "unbalanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. He accuses Nicolas of living "by lying, by fame and by giving false testimony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
*   Nicolas calls Nando a "liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, "pervert bolsonaro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>, "dishonest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>, "hypocrite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:14">[01:59:14]</a>, and suggests he is attempting to "resurrect" his "rotten image" as "Pastor Nando" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26">[02:00:26]</a>. Nicolas also says Nando "doesn't know anything about the reality of Brazil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>.
*   There are references to previous insults, like Nicolas calling Nando a "dwarf" and Nando asking Nicolas to "prove that you did not have intercourse with homosexual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, which quickly devolved into mutual accusations regarding transvestites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Nicolas claims Nando imitated him "like a seal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   Nando criticizes Nicolas for "cursing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:28">[02:12:28]</a> during the debate, while Nicolas counters that Nando curses on his own channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:31">[02:13:31]</a>. This highlights [[controversies surrounding humor and free speech | controversies surrounding humor and free speech]] and the perceived double standards.

## Third Way and Future Political Landscape
When asked about the growth of a "third way" in the election, Nicolas states that it is "non-existent" and believes the second round will be between Lula and Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>. He says he would vote for Sergio Moro over Lula, but would "cancel" his vote between Moro and "a bandit" (implying Lula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a>.
Nando believes that unless there is an alternative, Brazil will face "destruction" and "misfortune," potentially like Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. He views Lula and Bolsonaro as "bandits" leading to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:21">[02:02:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
Both participants use their concluding remarks to reiterate their main arguments and criticisms of the other. Nicolas emphasizes his ongoing work as a councilor, his focus on truth, and his belief that his work is clean and serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:28">[02:04:28]</a>. He highlights his legislative achievements and anti-corruption efforts at the municipal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:51">[02:04:51]</a>. Nando reiterates his accusations against Bolsonaro's government regarding economic decline, corruption, and the president's perceived betrayal of promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>. He paints a grim picture of Brazil's current state and future if the current political trajectory continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. The debate concludes with no clear resolution, emphasizing the deep divisions and [[role_of_social_media_and_political_views_in_public_perception | differing perceptions]] within Brazilian politics.

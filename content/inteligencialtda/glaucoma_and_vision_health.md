The speaker discusses their personal experience with glaucoma and its impact on their vision and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">00:47:47</a>.

## Personal Experience with Glaucoma
The speaker has been diagnosed with glaucoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">00:47:47</a>. This condition has resulted in the loss of a significant portion of their peripheral vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">00:47:49</a>. Due to this vision impairment, they are unable to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">00:48:03</a>. The condition has progressively worsened over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">00:48:11</a>.

In an effort to manage the condition, the speaker underwent surgery on both eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">00:48:18</a>. They describe their vision as "very dark around dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">00:48:28</a>. Their eyes were also sensitive to strong light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">00:48:31</a>. The speaker first became aware of their glaucoma around 2016 or 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">00:48:52</a>. At the time of their trip to the United States, they knew about the condition but had not yet experienced significant vision loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">00:48:58</a>.

In addition to glaucoma, the speaker also suffers from astigmatism and myopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">00:49:01</a>. For these conditions, the general advice given is to use eye drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">00:49:12</a>. However, they note that their vision is not expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">00:49:16</a>. The lack of peripheral vision has led to difficulties and accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">00:49:47</a>. The speaker admits they "don't see much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">00:50:31</a>.

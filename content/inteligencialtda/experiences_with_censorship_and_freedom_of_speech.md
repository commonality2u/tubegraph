Danilo Gentili's career has been significantly shaped by [[discussion_on_political_ideologies_and_critiques | experiences with censorship]] and challenges to his freedom of speech, especially regarding his humor and political commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He has faced numerous "persecuted cases" and "processes" aimed at hindering his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Navigating Political Humor
Gentili notes a shift in the media and public reception of political humor over time.

### Early Career and the PT Party
During his time as a reporter for CQC in 2008, Gentili questioned a Workers' Party (PT) leader about alleged cash registers, leading to his expulsion from Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. He observed that certain political figures, particularly from the PT, were "spoiled by the press" and placed on a pedestal where they could not be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

He contrasts this with earlier periods where comedians like those from Casseta & Planeta freely mocked presidents like Itamar, Collor, and Fernando Henrique without issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. However, when they began to joke about Lula, retaliation started, with journalists and artists criticizing their humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Gentili remarks that there's a "patrolling" or "protection" around certain political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### The Rise of "Cancel Culture"
Gentili states that the challenges he faces are similar to those experienced by Wilson Simonal, whom he calls "the first cancelled in Brazil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, unlike Simonal, Gentili benefits from the internet, which allows him to respond to criticism directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

He recounts an incident in 2010 where he was forbidden from making political jokes at a show, prompting him to perform a "politically incorrect" stand-up show live on UOL in front of Congress in Brasilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>. This show, which included "heavy jokes" about Lula and Dilma, garnered significant attention and marked a turning point where he became a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>. He noted that while he joked about all politicians, jokes about Dilma led to accusations of sexism from the journalism class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>.

This period also saw the emergence of discussions around the "limit of humor," with some deeming his jokes as "offense" rather than comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>. Gentili finds it "unbearable" that some comedians now censor others, demanding "militancy" in humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Legal and Public Repercussions
Gentili has faced legal actions and public outcry due to his jokes.

### The "Cow" Joke Incident
In 2013, a joke on his show about a Brazilian woman seeking a Guinness World Record for milk donation, referencing a separate news story about "Kid Bengala" (a public figure), led to significant controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:49">[02:11:49]</a>. Despite the joke not calling the woman a "cow," news outlets, especially those aligned with the PT, published headlines claiming he did, leading to public outrage and a lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. The woman later claimed her milk dried up and children were starving because of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:29">[02:15:29]</a>. Gentili emphasizes that the media created a false narrative, portraying him as an "oppressor" against a "poor northeastern woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. He stated he lost the lawsuit despite evidence to the contrary, due to external pressure and the established "narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>.

### Broader Harassment and Lawsuits
Gentili describes facing constant harassment, including threats and fabricated stories, often stemming from his political jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a>. He notes a distinction between "bolsominions" who attack on Twitter and "progressives" who attack in newspaper newsrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>, implying the latter have greater institutional power. He has been subjected to criminal charges, such as one from Manuela d'Ávila over a 2018 tweet, where he was forced to testify at a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>.

He views these legal actions, often funded by public money, as attempts to silence him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:41">[02:03:41]</a>. He was even sentenced to prison in the first instance for a joke involving Maria do Rosário, highlighting the severity of the repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:38">[02:08:38]</a>. Gentili attributes this to a narrative where white men are considered "oppressors" and jokes are equated to real-world actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>.

## Standing Firm
Despite the challenges, Gentili insists on maintaining his comedic approach. He believes that a comedian should have the freedom to mock the president, regardless of political affiliation, and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. He maintains that humor thrives in difficult times, stating, "the worse the better" for comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>. He believes the only way out is to "keep beating" and making documentaries to expose the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>.

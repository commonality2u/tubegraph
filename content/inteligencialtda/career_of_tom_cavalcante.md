Tom Cavalcante's career began in his youth, marked by early exposure to comedy and an innate stage presence despite personal shyness. His journey saw him transition from aspiring football player to renowned comedian, television host, and actor, establishing himself as a prominent figure in Brazilian entertainment.

## Early Influences and Beginnings

Despite being a shy individual in everyday life, Tom Cavalcante found strength and confidence on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. His earliest memories of comedy involve watching Oscarito and Jerry Lewis on black and white television around the age of 10, finding their antics very funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Later, he began to understand that comedians like [[Chico Anysio]] and Renato Aragão, who were from his home state of Ceará, were "great comedians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

In his youth, around 16 or 17, this curiosity about comedy awoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. He started performing in church, reading homilies, and participating in youth musical groups and *jograis* (groups of young people who sang at mass), which he describes as getting "stuck acting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. His father, a salesman, exposed him to various collections, books, and even medicine names, which later influenced his show content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. His father was also a very good-humored and extroverted man who gathered friends to tell jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

A significant turning point in his life was the sudden death of his mother when he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. This profoundly affected him, leading him to therapy until he was about 27 or 28 to cope with the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. After this traumatic event, he chose to "be happy" and started making jokes and playing with life, developing a "shield against death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

## Transition to Entertainment

After his mother's death, he and his siblings moved to live with relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. While living with an aunt, in a neighborhood with many football players, he began playing ball and developed his first character, "Marcelo Central," a nickname given to him by local boys who thought he played well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. He played in youth teams for Ceará and the Air Force for about 16 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>. He eventually quit football to pursue comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.

He started wanting to do radio, influenced by listening to football narrators like Gomes Farias, whom he began imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>. His radio career began at FM do Povo, the first FM station in Ceará, where he worked from 3 AM to 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. He also took a job as a newspaper proofreader to earn more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. His stage name, "Tom Cavalcante," was given to him by João Inácio Junior, a well-known figure in Ceará radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.

Tom began performing comedy shows in beach huts in Fortaleza, singing and imitating artists like Gilberto Gil, Fagner, and Belchior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. His success led to performances at popular bars, where artists like Fagner and Belchior encouraged him to go to Rio de Janeiro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

## Entry into Television (Globo)

His television career started with educational TV modules in Ceará, where he presented classes on Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. His big break came through [[Chico Anysio]], whom he considered one of his idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>. After recording commercials for [[Chico Anysio]]'s show, he managed to meet him in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07:00">[46:07:00]</a>. [[Chico Anysio]] initially told him that success "depends on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>. After demonstrating his talent for voices and characters, [[Chico Anysio]] invited him to write for him, specifically two characters, Azambuja and a dyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:59:00">[59:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. He received significant help from journalist Nonato Albuquerque in writing these scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

This led to an invitation to a screenwriters' meeting at Globo in Rio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. He was initially barred from entry but later gained access with the help of Stepan Nercessian, who recognized his writing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. At this meeting, he met major figures like Boni and other screenwriters like Rodrigo and Guiaroni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

In 1991, [[Chico Anysio]] saw Tom perform his "drunk" character (who would become [[João Canabrava]]) and decided it would be a "revolution" to put a drunk character in a classroom setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. This led to Tom's debut as [[João Canabrava]] in *Escolinha do Professor Raimundo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. The show was a massive success, reportedly holding 90% of the audience share at the time and being called the "trashiest program in Latin America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.

## Transition to *Sai de Baixo*

After four years on *Escolinha do Professor Raimundo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>, Tom received an invitation from Boni, a director at Globo, to join a new program called *Sai de Baixo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. He had to leave *Escolinha* to take this new opportunity, which initially hurt [[Chico Anysio]], but they eventually reconciled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>.

In *Sai de Baixo*, Tom played Ribamar, a doorman in a decadent São Paulo building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. The character was designed to be a "bungler" who could handle everyone's lives and was free to fall in love with various characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. Due to Tom's improvisational style, the show's directors decided to dedicate a camera specifically to him, as he would jump into the audience or move freely around the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>. He learned a lot from working with Miguel Falabella, who was exceptional at improvisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. *Sai de Baixo* aired on Sunday nights after *Fantástico* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. It was so impactful that a survey indicated it helped decrease the suicide rate in São Paulo during its four-year run, by offering a "happy Sunday night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:22">[01:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>.

## Post-*Sai de Baixo* and other projects

After *Sai de Baixo*, Tom Cavalcante had his own program on Globo, *Mega Tom*, which aired in the afternoon, competing with popular shows like Gugu's and Faustão's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>. He found the show "very light" and didn't adapt very well to its format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.

After a year, he received an "irrefutable" invitation from Record TV, offering not only money but also creative freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. He hired a team that included comedians like Tiririca, Shaolin, David Cardoso, Alexandre Frota, and Maguila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>. His show at Record was daily, from Monday to Friday, featuring different segments each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:44">[01:57:44]</a>. He became known for breaking "dogmas" by including religious references or controversial topics in his humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. One memorable live segment featured politician Clodovil wearing sandals of humility, which generated high ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:38">[02:00:38]</a>.

## Time in Los Angeles

After seven years at Record, feeling physically and mentally fatigued from the demanding daily routine, Tom decided to leave for Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37">[01:54:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:20">[02:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>. He paid a significant fine to break his contract early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>.

In Los Angeles, he studied cinema and financed a film called "Pizza With The Mafia," about 1960s New York gangsters, in which he also acted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>. He hired an agent who worked with famous actors like Rodrigo Santoro and Seu Jorge, and met top comedy agents who managed careers like Jim Carrey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:36">[02:10:36]</a>. During his time there, he named his dog "Brad Pet" after his neighbor, Brad Pitt, leading to a humorous encounter at the vet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:59">[02:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:06">[02:17:06]</a>. He also had an amusing interaction with Usher, who rented his house and requested everyone be isolated during his visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:38">[02:18:38]</a>.

## Return to Brazil and Current Projects

Upon his return to Brazil, he received proposals from Multishow and other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>. His current projects include *Multi Tom*, *Dr. Darci* (a show about a male psychologist character with a female radio voice), and *LOL* on Amazon Prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he learned to use the internet and produced many political videos, which gained significant traction and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>. His current show at Teatro Bradesco features stories from his life, including an anecdote about Geraldo Alckmin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>.

## Relationships with other artists

Tom Cavalcante has cultivated relationships with many prominent figures in Brazilian music and comedy:

*   **Roberto Carlos**: He has been associated with Roberto Carlos for 16 years, performing on his "Cruise of Emotions on the High Seas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. He humorously recounted a story where Roberto Carlos pranked him by showing him a new Corvette and making him believe it was a gift, only to drive away in his own old Corsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Ivete Sangalo**: He has a "great affection" for Ivete Sangalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:25">[03:19:25]</a>. He first met her when she was a young, unknown artist and he helped her pick up scattered sheet music at a hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:09">[03:19:09]</a>.
*   **Renato Aragão (Didi)**: Tom has known Didi since his time at *Escolinha*, often visiting the *Trapalhões* set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:37">[02:40:37]</a>. He considers Didi an "icon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:10">[02:41:10]</a>.

*   **Benito Di Paula**: He expresses a desire to have Benito Di Paula on his show, praising his musical talent and spiritual depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>.

## Reflections on Career and Life

Tom reflects on the hardest moment of his life being the sudden death of his mother at age 13, which was a "very painful break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:08">[03:21:08]</a>. However, he maintains a strong faith and believes his mother's "light" helped guide him to where he is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:09">[03:22:09]</a>. He believes humor has an important function in society, serving as a critique and helping people gain consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:12">[03:11:12]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of evolution in comedy, noting that what was funny 10 or 20 years ago might not be appropriate today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

He advises aspiring artists to train and prepare thoroughly, establishing a clear plan while allowing for improvisation and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:53">[03:08:53]</a>. He notes that the younger generation has a "world of opportunity" due to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>. His main concern for Brazil is the country's unfairness and political division, hoping for stability for those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:17">[03:24:17]</a>.

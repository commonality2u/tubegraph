Sarah Sheeva has faced numerous [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | challenges]] and controversies throughout her life and ministry, particularly following her conversion to Christianity. These range from deeply personal struggles and the overhaul of her career to public disagreements and spiritual warfare.

## Early Career and Conversion
Born into a family of renowned Brazilian musicians Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, Sarah Sheeva grew up with significant freedom and exposure to the entertainment industry. She was never repressed or forbidden from anything by her parents, who encouraged her to choose her own destiny and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This background led her to form the successful secular music band SNZ with her sisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

However, her conversion process, which began in October 1997 at the age of 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, fundamentally changed her trajectory. She felt she could no longer sing "entertainment" music and instead desired to sing "music that frees, music that transforms, music that changes the soul, music that cures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This conviction led to the dissolution of her band. Initially, her record label's problems with piracy led to the band's dismissal, which Sheeva secretly celebrated as a divine intervention to free her from her contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Theological and Doctrinal Controversies

### Music and Arts
Sheeva holds a strong conviction regarding the nature of music, arguing that there is no "neutral music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>; all music is either inspired by heaven or by hell. She believes music can release "medicine or poisons" into the soul, influencing individuals and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This belief stems from a supernatural vision where she saw a demonic entity declaring its intention to "steal God's worship, steal His worshippers, steal His music, steal His arts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. She states that music is one of Satan's greatest weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, and therefore, Christians should not consume secular music. She herself made a covenant with God to "never sing a song from the world" or "dance a world song" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Sexuality and Marriage
Sheeva's teachings on sexuality and marriage are highly conservative and have generated significant discussion. She emphasizes that sex is exclusively for marriage and is a "privilege of marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. She has publicly shared her personal commitment to abstinence for over 22 years while single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This position has been a source of both admiration and mockery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

She critiques the concept of "stable unions" (cohabitation) without formal marriage steps, asserting that a couple must first legalize their union before human law, then receive priestly blessing, and finally consummate the marriage through physical union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Skipping these steps, particularly the first two, is seen as living in sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Her advice on dating includes avoiding physical intimacy, especially kissing, until marriage, to prevent instigating desires prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. She advises singles to focus on building friendship and understanding a person's character before physical involvement. She believes that a man's respect for a woman is directly linked to the difficulty he faced in conquering her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

She also teaches about the "transfer of spirits through sexual intercourse," asserting that there is no "neutral sex" and that illicit sexual encounters can allow demonic access into a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Holiness and Spiritual Integrity
Sheeva asserts that holiness is paramount, as "the devil is not afraid of anyone being used" but is afraid of "holiness in your private life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. She teaches about the five "entrance doors" (vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch) through which desires can be awakened, making constant vigilance necessary for spiritual purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Church Practices
She has identified "gaps in the church" regarding topics like sound theology, relationships, and the proper preparation of new converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. She argues that new converts should spend at least two years being discipled and trained before serving in church positions, to avoid compromising their [[modern_challenges_to_faith_and_spiritual_integrity | spiritual integrity]] due to unresolved sins or temptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Public Controversies and Attacks

### "Crazy Woman" Perception
Due to her outspoken views on holiness and purity, especially regarding sexuality, Sheeva became known as a "crazy woman" in the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. She initially faced humiliation for revealing her abstinence but later found that her transparency inspired many Christians to openly declare their commitment to holiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Fake News and Reputation Attacks
Sheeva has been targeted by what she calls "fake news" campaigns, particularly concerning her statements about gluttony. She once stated, "That's why there are so many fat believers," referring to gluttony as an unaddressed sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This was distorted into "Sara Sheeva says that fat people go to hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, leading to widespread backlash and threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. She suspects satanists and "infiltrated" people within gospel news sites were behind these attacks to discredit her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### Spiritual Warfare
Sheeva openly discusses her experiences with spiritual warfare, describing manifestations of "materialized witches" entering her home and direct demonic attacks, including one incident where she heard a spirit suffocating her son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. She considers these a normal part of her life due to her ministry, comparing her experiences to "more than Indiana Jones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. She attributes these attacks to the fact that her ministry makes a "difference" and challenges spiritual territories controlled by evil forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Controversial Prophecies
Sheeva has delivered several prophecies that have drawn public attention. One notable instance involved a country singer who passed away a month after Sheeva delivered a public prophecy, urging her to repent before her time of death came <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Sheeva believes the singer had an experience with God but "abandoned Jesus to sing in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Another prophecy concerned Daniel Silveira, a Brazilian politician. Sheeva delivered a word to him, recorded live by a vlogger without her knowledge, prophesying that God would do "something impossible, a miracle" for him. Two weeks later, Silveira received a pardon, which Sheeva attributes to the fulfillment of that prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Whistleblower and Truth-Teller Role
Despite the controversies, Sheeva sees herself as a "marked card" and a "wise person" who speaks the truth without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. She believes her willingness to speak uncomfortably about sin and holiness, even when it causes offense, is her calling. She states that she is "not a hunter of controversial" topics but rather seeks to "awaken people to abandon sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. She argues that her protection comes from her holiness and unwavering obedience to God, not from her anointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Sarah Sheeva's public life is characterized by her profound commitment to her faith and a willingness to confront societal and religious norms. Her [[challenges_and_risks_faced_by_a_whistleblower | outspokenness]] on sensitive topics, her personal choices, and her claims of supernatural experiences have positioned her as a controversial figure, yet one who has deeply impacted many lives through her ministry and teachings on holiness.

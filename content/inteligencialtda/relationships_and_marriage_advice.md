## The Essence of Relationships: A Divine Perspective

The speaker, a pastor and emotional intelligence mentor, emphasizes that at its core, relationships, particularly [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]], are a reflection of a deeper, divine covenant. She views [[relationships_and_emotional_intelligence | fidelity]] and [[secrets_to_longterm_relationships | loyalty]] as central to a lasting bond, mirroring God's relationship with humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

> "Marriage is the way how God found to speak to the people. The Bible begins with a wedding of Adam and Eve, the Bible ends with marriage and Christ and that church. The thing most important thing in Christian life after accepting Jesus is marriage, the choice who you are going to marry." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>

This perspective informs all her advice on [[secrets_to_longterm_relationships | dating]], [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]], and personal conduct.

### The Problem of Desire and External Influences

A significant challenge in [[relationships_and_emotional_intelligence | relationships]] stems from unfulfilled desires, which the speaker links to anguish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. She posits that desires are never truly satisfied, always wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

Humans are influenced through five "entrance doors": vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. The devil, according to her, constantly exploits these doors to awaken desires that lead to destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.

#### The Impact of Music and Arts

Music, a powerful force, is highlighted as either inspired by heaven or hell, with no neutral ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:49">[02:44:49]</a>. Profane music is seen as carrying "files" (downloads from hell) that can release demons and corrupt the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:53">[02:43:53]</a>. She advises being radical about what one consumes, including films, and to pray in tongues as a shield against negative influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>.

The speaker believes that all shows are "cults in disguise," where something or someone is being worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. This conviction led her to abandon her secular music career, as she felt her shows were inadvertently worshipping other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>.

#### Sexuality as a Pillar

Sexuality is identified as one of the two main pillars of invocation on Earth (the other being arts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:02">[03:04:02]</a>. God uses the metaphor of sexual "prostitution" and "adultery" to describe unfaithfulness in worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. Therefore, sexuality must be consecrated to God within [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:32">[03:04:32]</a>.

She emphasizes that sexual intercourse is not neutral but involves a "transfer of spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:12">[02:58:12]</a>. For a married couple filled with the Holy Spirit, it's a communion of the Holy Spirit. However, if conducted outside of divine obedience, it grants the devil a right to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:32">[02:58:32]</a>.

### Advice for Singles and Dating

The speaker's personal transformation from a "promiscuous" woman to one practicing [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | abstinence]] for over 22 years highlights her core belief that happiness does not depend on being in a [[relationships_and_emotional_intelligence | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.

*   **Self-Fulfillment First:** One must be a "full and happy" individual to attract a similarly complete partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. Unhappy individuals tend to attract dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:33">[01:46:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Friendship and Character:** For men, liking what they see (beauty) is important, but for women, admiration for a man's character is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. Friendship should be the foundation, not just physical attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.
*   **The "No Kiss" Rule (for some):** While not a universal doctrine, for those with a past that could easily lead to sin, she advises against kissing before [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]] to prevent unwanted arousal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>.
*   **The "Hand Test":** On a first date, she suggests a "hand test." If a man places his hand on a woman's, she should politely remove it and state her boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>. An abusive man will react negatively to limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>. This helps discern character before emotional attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:08">[02:10:08]</a>.
*   **Dating for Discernment:** The purpose of dating is to truly get to know the person, including their bad sides, and to see if temperaments fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:12">[01:53:12]</a>. This time is for discussion and reflection, not intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:18">[01:53:18]</a>.
*   **Rejecting Worldly Standards:** She condemns the idea that sexual performance or wealth are the basis for a lasting [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]], stating that a woman's admiration is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

### Advice for Married Couples and Marriage Steps

For couples, the speaker outlines three essential steps for a biblically sanctioned [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]]:
1.  **Legalization before human law:** Going to the judge and preparing documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:14">[01:40:14]</a>.
2.  **Priestly Blessing:** Receiving a blessing from a pastor or priest who believes in God's word, which can even be done in a home backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>.
3.  **Consummation (Honeymoon):** Having sexual intercourse to physically consummate the union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>.

She criticizes couples who skip these steps, especially those who only engage in sex before the other steps, stating that while human law might recognize it out of mercy, it's not God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.

#### Addressing Past Mistakes

For couples who started their [[relationships_and_emotional_intelligence | relationship]] "in sin," she advises a period of repentance and consecration, including at least 40 days of sexual abstinence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

#### Maintaining Intimacy in Marriage

Once married, she emphasizes the importance of kissing as the "flame of [[secrets_to_longterm_relationships | marriage]]" and sex, which is often attacked after [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | marriage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. She encourages couples to maintain passion and not settle for a "mediocre sexual life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

## Personal Challenges and Controversy

The speaker has faced significant opposition due to her teachings, particularly her strong stance on [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | sexual purity]] and [[impact_of_technology_and_modern_culture_on_relationships | secular music]]. She claims to have been the first person to openly discuss [[marriage_and_relationships_in_islam | abstinence]] in the media, a topic previously considered humiliating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>.

She also recounts facing "spiritual warfare," including threats and "fake news" campaigns, as a result of her ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>. Despite this, she sees it as confirmation that she is "doing what God wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:39">[02:28:39]</a>. Her openness about her past, including promiscuity, is meant to show that anyone can be transformed, not to boast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.

She also recounts a public "disagreement" with a pop singer, Anitta, over the concept of "empowerment." The speaker asserts that true empowerment for women is about being respected as sacred, not about revealing the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:09">[03:01:09]</a>. This led to a viral video where she declared, "My body is not for everyone," stating it is reserved for her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:49">[03:02:49]</a>. She feels compassion for artists who may be trapped by contracts or expectations, as she once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:34">[02:44:34]</a>.

Her [[navigating_personal_and_professional_challenges | personal anecdotes and relationships]] illustrate the practical application of her beliefs, and how her [[family_and_personal_life_developments | family]] and past experiences shaped her current ministry on [[relationships_and_emotional_intelligence | emotional intelligence]] and [[dealing_with_infidelity_and_reconciliation_in_relationships | relationship]] dynamics.

The modern world is experiencing a shift in the nature of control, moving away from territorial expansion towards a "dispute of control" over the minds and hearts of people, as well as their DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This new era, dubbed "the era of control," suggests a future where human beings are "highly monitored, highly manipulated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Yuval Noah Harari's Perspective

Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, known for his books *Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*, theorizes that traditional 20th-century worldviews, such as communist/socialist and liberal/capitalist, are outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Harari argues that humans do not and never truly possessed free will, viewing human beings as a "result of electrical chemical processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. He illustrates this by suggesting that extreme actions, like stabbing a neighbor, are due to "disorders" or "pathologies" within these processes, not a deliberate bad choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Harari suggests that if technology could introduce devices to control human impulses and undesirable behaviors (e.g., stopping violent urges or suicidal thoughts), such control would be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. He refers to the coming age as the era of "superhumans," where human beings will be "improved by account of the introduction of chips and some electronic devices" that enable them to compete with [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] through genetic modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

The danger of this advancement lies in who will control these devices, especially if they are internet-accessible and capable of influencing personal choices and reading minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The argument is that free will is increasingly being surrendered, sometimes willingly, for convenience or perceived benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

### Control Through Data and Algorithms
Even without implanted devices, control is already manifesting through social networks and streaming services. Platforms like Netflix analyze user preferences and suggest content, limiting individual choice and creating "bubbles" where users are primarily exposed to information that confirms their existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This constant data collection means every aspect of an individual's life online is "mapped out" and used for targeted suggestions, further eroding genuine freedom of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## Technology and Human Physiology

Technological advancements are also impacting human biology. The speaker discusses [[effect_of_technology_in_healthcare | medical advancements]] such as treatments for depression using electrodes and magnets to normalize brain chemistry, which have shown curative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. While beneficial, these technologies raise questions about the extent to which they interfere with human decision-making and even faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

The field of epigenetics suggests that human thoughts and emotions can influence gene expression, affecting susceptibility to conditions like depression across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:48:00">[45:48:00]</a>. Similarly, repeated patterns of thought can create permanent neural pathways in the brain, affecting behavior and addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. Scientists are now mapping these processes, leading to the idea that if they understand how the brain works, they can "interfere" with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:13:00">[47:13:00]</a>.

## The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Transhumanism

The current era is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, distinguished by its integration of biotechnology and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:00">[43:01:00]</a>. Unlike previous revolutions that reshaped labor and family structures, this one will "interfere in people's lives" and "biodiversity" by integrating chips that analyze DNA and potentially control human functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>.

The concept of "eternal life" through technology is also explored, where an individual's brain could be fully copied onto disks and then transferred to physical clones, effectively allowing consciousness to persist beyond the original body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This vision is a criticism of traditional morality and ethics, favoring a "superhuman" who operates without moral restrictions, echoing figures like Hitler, who was influenced by Nietzsche's concept of the "Ubermensch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>.

### Eugenics and Social Control
The discussion also touches upon the dangers of eugenics, where technological advancements could lead to the creation of a "superior race" based on desired genetic traits, leaving those without means as an "inferior race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. Countries like Sweden and Italy are already seeing voluntary microchip implantation, but the future raises concerns about mandatory implantation for "dangerous persons" to control their temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

> "We are evolving into an era of control... it's very dangerous. It's very dangerous and it's funny because with the internet we imagined it would be the opposite, right? Greater freedom and less control..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>

## Societal Impact

The increasing role of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] and technology in daily life is accelerating the move towards a monitored society. China, for instance, uses facial recognition extensively to track citizens, affecting their social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. While individuals can attempt to disconnect, complete avoidance of technology is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

The UN 2030 Agenda is mentioned as a globalist vision seeking transformations in various areas like the environment, clean energy, and social prejudices, which some believe aligns with the agenda of an Antichrist figure aiming for global control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>. This agenda prioritizes global interests over nationalism, leading to resistance from figures like Donald Trump and Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>.

Overall, the discussion highlights that the [[impact_of_technology | impact of technology]] and [[impact_of_technology_and_modern_society_on_human_behavior | modern society]] on human behavior is leading to a future of unprecedented control and manipulation, with implications for individual freedom, belief systems, and global governance.

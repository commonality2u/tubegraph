Within [[Catholic beliefs and practices | Catholic beliefs and practices]], the concept of [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual warfare]] and the role of [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcism]] are significant, acknowledging an ongoing battle between good and evil for the human soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## The Origin of Evil and Suffering
God does not send suffering as punishment; rather, suffering is often a corrective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. God allows certain things to happen due to human freedom and the misuse of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. The world is seen as being under the "yoke of the enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>. Problems in the world are often a result of the misuse of human freedom, leading to "monsters" and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:59">[01:32:59]</a>.

## The Devil's Targets and Methods
The devil aims to destroy two primary institutions: the family and the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. He works to take away freedom, hope, and fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. The devil, being a fallen angel (Lucifer), retains his angelic intelligence, allowing him to deceive humans effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Every lie, according to teachings, originates from the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>.

The devil is described as "tied at the foot of the cross," meaning he cannot attack if individuals do not approach him or "give him reach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>. He takes advantage of "gaps" or "little holes" in one's life, which can include seemingly minor transgressions like engaging with pornography or harboring anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:02">[01:51:02]</a>. These "concessions" or openings in one's life act as beacons in the spiritual world, inviting the enemy to take advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:11">[01:52:11]</a>.

## The Role of Exorcism and Deliverance
While everyday spiritual struggles are common, genuine demonic possession is an exceptional case where the enemy takes control of mental faculties and can disfigure a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:27">[01:34:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. In such cases, [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcism]] is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.

### Requirements for an Exorcist
A priest cannot simply choose to be an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]]; they require appointment by a bishop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. This role is a specialization requiring study of rites and formulas, but more importantly, a strong vocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. An [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]] must maintain a life of very serious confession and communion, being "in armor all complete" for the spiritual battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:36">[01:52:36]</a>. The enemy often attempts to exploit an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]]'s sins during a session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. Many [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcists]] die young, often from cancer, due to the intense wear and tear of this spiritual combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:13">[01:53:13]</a>.

### Eyewitness Accounts of Possession and Exorcism
A priest recounts an [[Spiritual experiences and manifestations | experience]] with a young girl exhibiting signs of demonic obsession and possible possession during a healing and deliverance session, including cheering, contortion, foaming at the mouth, and a distorted voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>. The demon within her declared the priest was "not an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]]" and lacked power over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>. The girl's body showed marks, suggesting self-mutilation or demonic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:14">[01:43:14]</a>. The priest, not being an [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]], commanded the demon "in the name of Jesus" to grant a truce for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>. The girl was later fully attended to by a legitimate [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]] and her life was transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:09">[01:47:09]</a>.

Demons can be cast out instantly or gradually, as observed by renowned [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Exorcist]] Father Gabriele Amorth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. An example of instantaneous deliverance is recounted with Pope St. John Paul II, who, after a woman suffering demonic possession was brought to him, simply laid hands on her and prayed, causing her to fall down the stairs "fully exorcised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>.

### Post-Deliverance and [[Spiritual Warfare and Protective Practices | Protective Practices]]
After deliverance, it is crucial not to leave the "house clean and empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. A person who has been delivered or converted must fully embrace Jesus Christ, filling their life with God and the [[role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_struggles | Holy Spirit]] to prevent the demon from returning with others worse than itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:39">[01:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>. This concept is supported biblically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

### Protection through Saint Benedict
[[Spiritual warfare and protective practices | Saint Benedict]] is highly recommended for protection against evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. His famous prayer, "May the Holy Cross be my light, let not the dragon be my guide; get out of the way Satan, never tempt me with your vanities. Drink your own poison," is based on his own experiences of attempts on his life where he was miraculously protected from poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:33">[01:48:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. The prayer serves as a powerful tool in [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:28">[01:49:28]</a>.

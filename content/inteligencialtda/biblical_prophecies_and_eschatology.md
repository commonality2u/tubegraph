The study of [[Biblical eschatology and prophecy|eschatology]] focuses on end-time events and their significance, often drawing parallels between biblical texts and current global developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. Recent events, such as the war in Israel and global natural disasters, are perceived by some as indicators of accelerating end-time prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:02">[05:40:02]</a>.

## Prophetic Visions and the New World Order

The concept of a New World Order, where the Antichrist establishes a single global government, currency, and religion, is a central theme in [[interpretations of Biblical prophecy and the end times|biblical prophecy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:07">[08:10:07]</a>. This establishment is envisioned as a long-term process, spanning centuries, involving influential individuals and organizations across all societal sectors, including finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:25">[08:25:25]</a>.

According to a theory attributed to former Satanist Doc Marx, based on a vision reportedly received by Albert Pike in 1870, three world wars are prophesied to facilitate the establishment of this New World Order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:07">[09:31:07]</a>.

### The First Two World Wars

1.  **First World War**: Its purported objective was to overthrow the Tsarist government in Russia, which resisted the establishment of a central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:46">[10:30:46]</a>. This led to the rise of a militaristic, atheist, communist nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:07">[10:54:07]</a>. Notably, Lenin received financial support from the world's banking elite for the communist revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Second World War**: The goal was to strengthen this new communist nation into a superpower, capable of destroying other nations and religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. The persecution of faiths in the Soviet Union, including Christian and Jewish, aligns with this prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Russia emerged as a superpower, creating an "antithesis" (communism) to "thesis" (capitalism), leading to the Cold War and global polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. This polarization, where people are pitted against each other (e.g., rich vs. poor, black vs. white, Arab vs. Jew), is seen as a strategy to distract humanity from the larger, subtle plan for a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

### The Third World War

The third world war is predicted to begin between Jews and Arabs/Islam, specifically Israel and Islamic fundamentalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. This prophecy, made in 1870, is significant as Israel was not yet a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. From the chaos and ashes of this conflict, the Antichrist is expected to emerge as a global leader, offering economic and social solutions to bring peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Context and the Spiritual War

The current conflict between Israel and Hamas is viewed as a drawing of the "scenery on the horizon" for this third war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. The atrocities committed by Hamas are seen as unprecedented in recent generations, referencing scenes from the Holocaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>. The immediate danger is the escalation involving Hezbollah, Iran, and potentially the United States and Russia, which could trigger a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

Beyond political and territorial disputes, the conflict is fundamentally a "spiritual war" rooted in religious reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

### Growth of Islam and Extremism

Islam is cited as the fastest-growing religion globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>. While the majority of Muslims are not radical (only an estimated 15-20% are extremists), this still represents a significant number (around 320 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. Radical Islam believes Islam must be the world's only religion, leading to the persecution of other faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

The high fertility rates of Muslim women (averaging 3.1 children globally, 8.1 among emigrants in Europe) compared to declining rates in traditionally Christian countries (e.g., Germany 1.3, France 1.8) are changing demographics and transforming cultures, leading to the Islamization of nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>. This demographic shift is seen as a powerful strategy that impacts cultural and religious landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

### Historical Roots of Conflict and Land Ownership

The question of "whose land is it?" is central to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>. According to the Bible, God promised the land of Canaan (modern-day Palestine) to Abraham and his descendants around 2000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

A theology introduced around 1000 BC by an Islamic fundamentalist leader, Al-Mawardi, established the concepts of *Dar al-Islam* (House of Islam) and *Dar al-Harb* (House of Sword) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>. This theory dictates that any land once under Islamic rule (like Jerusalem since 638 AD) can never again be governed by non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12:00">[34:12:00]</a>. This explains the extremists' unwavering rejection of the State of Israel and their goal of its extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. The possibility of a two-state solution is thus rejected by this extremist view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.

Historically, the State of Israel was founded in 1948 following the British mandate, leading to immediate attacks from neighboring Arab countries aiming for its extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>. Despite these overwhelming odds, Israel has historically prevailed, seen by some as miraculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>.

The "Palestinians" today are primarily Arabs who migrated during the Ottoman Turkish Empire period, rather than descendants of the biblical Philistines (who were annihilated by Nebuchadnezzar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The Gaza Strip, for instance, belonged to Egypt from 1948-1967 before Israel took it in the Six-Day War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:03">[1:14:03]</a>. Israel removed its Jewish residents from Gaza in 2005 in a bid for peace, but Hamas won elections there in 2006, leading to its current use as a base for attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:45">[1:14:45]</a>.

## The Increase of Iniquity and Cultural Revolution

[[Prophetic visions and endtimes prophecy|Biblical prophecy]] (Matthew 24:12) indicates that in the end times, "iniquity" (disrespect for law, order, and God; rebellion and atheism) will multiply, causing love to grow cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This is seen as a necessary condition for the implementation of an anti-Christian New World Order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>.

The **Revolution of 1968** is identified as a key turning point. Originating from student protests, it rapidly gained momentum, drawing in leftist and communist leaders, and inspiring global counter-cultural movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>. This revolution brought a gradual degradation of morals, transforming Western culture. It marked a massive rupture with traditional Christianity in Europe and North America, discarding centuries of Judeo-Christian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>.

Key aspects of this cultural shift included:
*   **The Age of Aquarius**: Promoted at events like Woodstock (1969), symbolizing the end of the "Age of Pisces" (Christianity) and the dawn of a new, mystical era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.
*   **Drug Use**: Influencers like Harvard professor Timothy Leary promoted LSD to "expand the mind," leading to widespread drug use among youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Sexual Revolution**: German psychiatrist Herbert Marcuse argued against "sexual repression," leading to widespread "free sex" and the degradation of sexual morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:19">[02:05:19]</a>. Marcuse, a member of the Frankfurt School, aimed to destroy Western culture, capitalism, and the religious dimension of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:55">[02:05:55]</a>.
*   **Art and Media as Instruments**: Music (e.g., The Beatles' "Imagine," punk rock like Sex Pistols, heavy metal introducing Satanism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:32">[02:08:32]</a>, cinema, and literature became powerful tools to propagate ideas, shape thinking, and even engage in "predictive programming" (advertising future events to desensitize the public) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>.
*   **Attack on Family Values**: The Marxist theory (from Engels' *Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*) that the family unit is the origin of social inequality has fueled laws and movements aiming to dismantle traditional family structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

This cultural revolution is seen as having systematically instilled contempt for God's laws and a rebellion against order, leading to the multiplication of iniquity and the cooling of love as prophesied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. The widespread depression and anxiety in technologically advanced societies are seen as evidence that material satisfaction cannot fill the spiritual void created by this detachment from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:11">[02:31:11]</a>.

## The Illuminati and The Edomite Conspiracy

The Illuminati are believed to have originated from Sabbatianism and Frankism, two Jewish Kabbalistic sects that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>. These movements inverted traditional Jewish values, viewing the God of scripture as evil and Lucifer as good, abolishing biblical commandments, and permitting all sins, including sexual taboos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>.

A conspiracy theory suggests that the Illuminati are linked to the descendants of Esau (Edomites), who were historically hostile to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:48">[02:38:48]</a>. Esau, meaning "red," and his descendants (Edomites) were characterized by a red shield and associated with the color red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:47">[02:58:47]</a>. This lineage is believed to have "camouflaged" itself, converting to Judaism by force (as happened historically with John Hyrcanus converting the Idumeans, descendants of Edom) and infiltrating positions of influence in Jewish society, becoming "false Jews" or a "synagogue of Satan" (Revelation 2:9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:11">[02:49:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a>.

These alleged descendants of Edom are theorized to control global finance (e.g., the Rothschild family, whose name means "red shield" in German), media, and education, rewriting history and shaping global thought to pave the way for the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:33">[02:59:33]</a>.

## Fulfillment of Prophecies and Personal Response

Many believe that the events preceding the rapture of the Church have already been fulfilled, indicating Jesus' imminent return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The ongoing global crises, including potential natural disasters and nuclear war (as per occult predictions aligning with [[Biblical Prophecies and Their Fulfillments|biblical prophecy]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, serve as a call for humanity to repent, return to God, and accept Jesus as Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>.

The ultimate solution to the end-time conflict, particularly for Israel and the Arabs, is believed to come with the Antichrist's mediation of a peace agreement, leading to a global war involving the US, Iran, and Russia, from which he will emerge as the "solver of all problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. For believers, the role is to pray for Jerusalem and its inhabitants, trusting in God's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.

### The Role of the Church

The Church, as the "embassy of the Kingdom of God on Earth" and "Jesus' representative," is called to act as a "priestly nation," discipling others and revealing God's justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>. The restoration of the five ministries (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor, Teacher) within the Church is seen as a return to the model of the early Church in the book of Acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:51">[03:02:51]</a>.

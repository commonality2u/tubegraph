The [[Intelligence Ltda podcast discussion | *Inteligência Ltda*]] podcast is primarily hosted by [[Standup comedy in Brazil | comedians]] Estevam Nabote and Ed Gama, who share insights into their personal lives, careers, and the evolution of their show. The podcast aims for an informal, conversational style, reflecting a "barbecue vibe" rather than a rigid interview format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.

## The Podcast *Inteligência Ltda*

Launched in December, the podcast quickly gained a significant following, with the hosts aiming for 100,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The title, *Inteligência Ltda*, is ironically chosen as the show often features discussions that deviate from serious topics, focusing instead on personal anecdotes and humorous exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>. This unscripted approach, where they "talk shit," is intentional, aiming to create a relaxed environment for both hosts and listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>.

The podcast records episodes twice a week, typically on Tuesdays and Thursdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. Interaction with the audience is encouraged through "super chats" for questions and comments, with higher contributions allowing for promotion of personal businesses or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## The Hosts: Estevam Nabote and Ed Gama

### Estevam Nabote
Estevam Nabote's stage name, "Nabote," originates from a sermon he heard about a biblical wine grower, inspiring his commitment to preserving his "inheritance" of knowledge and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>. He has a background in law and worked as an environmental lawyer, even setting up his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. However, he eventually left his legal career to pursue [[Standup comedy experiences and challenges in Brazil | comedy full-time]], a decision he found challenging but ultimately rewarding due to the personal satisfaction it brought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:47">[02:27:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:35">[02:29:35]</a>.

Nabote openly discusses his struggles with attention deficit (ADD), which affected his focus and mood, especially when he was on Ritalin for eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>. He found that medication interfered with his ability to experience genuine emotions, including laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. He also shares a very personal story of discovering he was adopted and a victim of sexual abuse as a child, which deeply impacted his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:25">[02:21:25]</a>. Despite these challenges, Nabote maintains a strong Christian faith, viewing it as a personal connection with God separate from organized religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>.

### Ed Gama
Ed Gama's comedy career is influenced by his Northeastern roots, particularly humorists like Rossicleia and Zé Lezin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:55">[03:32:55]</a>. He is known for his work in [[Standup comedy in Brazil | stand-up comedy]] and on television, including the popular comedy group [[Porta dos Fundos | Porta dos Fundos]] and the segment "Quem Chega Lá" on *Domingão do Faustão* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>.

His collaboration with Nabote began casually when they met at a show. Their friendship grew from shared interests and mutual respect, forming a strong comedic duo that thrives on informal conversation rather than strict roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>. Ed emphasizes the importance of authenticity in their discussions, often sharing personal stories, such as a harrowing experience of flipping a car with his sister while a specific song was playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.

Ed learned valuable lessons about professionalism and connecting with an audience from industry veterans like Faustão and Tom Cavalcante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>. These experiences shaped his approach to comedy, focusing on genuine interaction and sharing relatable experiences, even if they are deeply personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

## Podcast and Media Influence

The hosts acknowledge the [[Podcast and Media Influence | influence of podcasts and media]] in today's society, recognizing their platform as a way to connect with a wider audience and share diverse experiences.

The informal "barbecue vibe" allows for spontaneous discussions on various topics, including family, food, and current events, reflecting the unpredictable nature of real conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.

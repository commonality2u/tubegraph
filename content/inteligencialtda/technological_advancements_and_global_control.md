Technological advancements are accelerating at an unprecedented pace, with significant developments occurring not just every decade or year, but now every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>. This rapid [[Impact of Technology | impact of technology]] is described as an "absurd jump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>, leading to discussions about its potential for global control.

## Exponential Growth of Knowledge and Mobility
The Bible, specifically the book of Daniel, prophesied that in the last days, people would "run from one side to the other" and "knowledge will multiply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. This aligns with current observations:
*   **Mobility:** Global travel has exploded, with an estimated 3.8 billion people flying in the United States alone in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:41">[01:46:41]</a>. Prior to the 19th century, travel methods (animals, sailing) remained largely unchanged since the time of Jesus, but the last 150 years have seen an "explosion of knowledge" and technology that has dramatically shortened distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Explosion:** The multiplication of knowledge, particularly in areas like [[Artificial intelligence and technology | artificial intelligence]] and quantum computing, is considered "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Pervasive Surveillance and Data Collection
This era of advanced [[Impact of Technology on Society | technology]] allows for total control, as individuals are "all catalogued, all registered freely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>.
*   **Personal Data:** Applications and social networks collect vast amounts of data, knowing individual preferences, purchases, and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:23">[01:48:23]</a>. This predictive capability is so advanced that some applications knew a woman was pregnant before she did, based on her behavioral patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>.
*   **Automated Systems:** Financial systems can flag and cancel transactions or cards based on unusual purchasing habits, demonstrating an automated level of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.
*   **Ubiquitous Connectivity (5G):** The rollout of 5G networks, with smaller, more numerous antennas every 200 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>, enables significantly greater control and data collection. This connectivity allows for global communication, even from remote locations like the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. The sheer number of satellites launched by companies will enable listening and tracking of everything, making privacy "impossible" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>.

## Future of Human Freedom and Control
The increasing dependence on [[modern_technology_and_the_apocalypse | technology]] points towards a future with diminishing freedom and increasing external control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
*   **Technological Dependence:** Society has become increasingly dependent on devices like cell phones, leading to "desperation" if they are lost or stolen due to the data they hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>. Smart homes and appliances will further integrate into daily life, monitoring habits and even preventing certain actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>.
*   **Biometric and Neural Implants:**
    *   The idea of using chips, like those in cell phones, is becoming normalized, with people in Sweden volunteering to receive chips for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42">[01:53:42]</a>.
    *   Neurolinking is an emerging technology, with requests already filed to introduce chips into humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>. These chips, acting as nano-robots, could monitor vital signs, detect predispositions to conditions like bipolar disorder, and even control medication release remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.
    *   The argument for such implants is to "boost" human brains to compete with [[Artificial intelligence and technology | artificial intelligence]], creating a "hybrid brain prosthesis" that provides enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.
    *   Future chips are predicted to interpret brain waves and thoughts, connecting individuals directly to the internet, allowing for instantaneous downloads of knowledge, similar to scenes from *The Matrix* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Control:** Autonomous vehicles, combined with street cameras, could enable remote control over an individual's movement, with the ability to lock doors and redirect the car to a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:58">[02:02:58]</a>.

## Global Control and Biblical Prophecy
These [[Impact of Technology on Society | technological advancements]] are seen as paving the way for a global control system, as described in biblical prophecies, particularly concerning the Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast.
*   **The Antichrist's System:** The Antichrist is believed to establish a system of global control that will encompass the economy, digital currency, and the movement of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>. This system would render physical money obsolete, allowing for instant cancellation of an individual's access to funds with "just one button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:34">[01:52:34]</a>.
*   **The Mark of the Beast:** The "mark of the beast" (666) is interpreted as a "subcutaneous introduction of a nano-robot" or a chip with [[Artificial intelligence and technology | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:53">[02:17:53]</a>. This mark, placed on the hand or forehead, would be connected to the internet, allowing control over individuals, including their ability to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a>. The term "mark" in Greek, *harama*, implies a physical mark made with an object that pierces the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28">[02:17:28]</a>. The Internet (WWW) is seen as the system that will facilitate the introduction and control of this chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:40">[02:19:40]</a>.
*   **The Great Reset:** This globalist agenda, proposed by figures like Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum, seeks to "reset" the world, claiming that humanity will "have nothing and be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. It includes a single world currency and a shift to "clean energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a>, aligning with the UN 2030 agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:26">[02:13:26]</a>. This agenda would diminish national sovereignty, with global governance influencing laws and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a>. However, some nations, like Russia and China, are currently resisting this globalist agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>.

## Societal and Spiritual Implications
The increasing control facilitated by [[The Impact of Technology on Society | technology]] also has spiritual implications.
*   **Cooling of Love:** As iniquity multiplies, the "love of many will cool down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, leading to a spiritual lukewarmness where people are neither truly cold nor hot in their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:56">[03:25:56]</a>. This cooling is considered worse than hate or evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Persecution of Faith:** Christians are increasingly viewed as prejudiced and their faith as "politically incorrect," with a growing acceptance of anti-Christian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:08">[03:27:08]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Warfare:** The technological control is intertwined with a spiritual war for human souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:45">[03:44:45]</a>. This battle manifests as invasive thoughts, discouragement, sadness, and constant temptation, especially to steer individuals away from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:11">[03:51:11]</a>. Giving "place to the devil" through sin, hate, or anger creates "gaps" in one's spiritual armor that demons can exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. Resisting requires believing in God's love and power, confessing sins, and declaring God's word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:38">[03:02:38]</a>.

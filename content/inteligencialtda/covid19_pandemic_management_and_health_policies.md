Brazil declared a state of emergency at the beginning of February 2020 in response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, observing developments that began in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. Brazilians who were in affected regions, such as Wuhan, were brought back and isolated with all necessary care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

## Initial Response and Public Messaging
Despite the declaration of emergency, authorities at the state level, including the São Paulo government, initially stated that Carnival posed no problem and even invited foreigners to Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. They also suggested that the hot climate would prevent the virus from being effective, as it was believed to primarily affect colder climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>. However, after Carnival, mixing people from around the world, deaths began to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

The federal government's approach involved daily discussions with small groups and experts to understand the global situation and strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. The initial concern was to "flatten the curve" by staying home to allow time for hospitals to equip themselves with respirators and set up field hospitals, which was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

## Restrictive Measures and Economic Impact
Due to a Supreme Federal Court decision, the authority to implement more restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, was delegated to governors and mayors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. The federal government was against closing everything, advocating that only the elderly and those with comorbidities should isolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. The argument was that while people died from COVID-19, many more would die if economic activity ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

This policy led to discussions about mental health, with concerns raised about the rise in [[Mental health awareness postpandemic | depression]], anxiety, and suicides due to the "stay at home" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. The government maintained that asymptomatic young people should not have schools closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

Financially, the government spent 720 billion reais on COVID-19 related issues in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. Public servants did not receive wage adjustments for three years due to the pandemic's impact on the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. Informal workers, who lost their jobs, received emergency aid of R$600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. This aid and other maintenance programs helped prevent a collapse of the economy and widespread chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>.

## Vaccine Procurement and Controversies
In 2020, there were no vaccines available globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. The first vaccine was applied in the United Kingdom in December 2020, with Brazil beginning vaccinations in January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. The government faced criticism for not immediately buying vaccines, but clarified that early Pfizer proposals lacked commitment to delivery and did not include responsibility for side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Contradictory Messaging
> "Where did I go wrong where did I say maybe the guy turns into an alligator It wasn't a joke it was a figure of speech from the left to opposition looks at the guy mocking the vaccine will turn into an alligator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>

Discussions around vaccine side effects were considered taboo, with the government facing accusations of "mocking the vaccine" for statements like "the guy turns into an alligator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. There were concerns about potential side effects, especially for children aged 5 to 11, with Anvisa reportedly advising parents to watch for symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations after vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. The government sought to shift liability for side effects away from the President, ultimately securing parliamentary approval that removed this responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

Governors, like Doria from São Paulo, were accused of using vaccine procurement as a political platform, while the federal government claimed all doses were purchased and distributed by the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. The government also cut official advertising expenses, which led to a negative perception in much of the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

## Treatment and Forbidden Discussions
The pandemic highlighted a perceived suppression of discussion around potential treatments. Doctors were reportedly prevented from administering certain medicines not explicitly on the approved list, even if they believed it could help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Suggestions for off-label use of drugs for malaria or worms were criminalized, with one senator proposing a three-year prison sentence for doctors prescribing anything outside the package insert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Additionally, the origin of the virus (laboratory, animal, or mutation) was a "forbidden to discuss" topic, leading to accusations of being a "flat earther" or "denier" for those who raised such questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

>[!INFO] Lessons Learned
> "But today if it comes another pandemic we will be in much more prepared because he has already come first one has all one one first one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>
> "those who fight can lose, those who don't fight You have already lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:25">[02:43:25]</a>

The experience of the pandemic, described as the most difficult moment in the President's life, provided crucial lessons for future preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:31">[02:33:31]</a>.

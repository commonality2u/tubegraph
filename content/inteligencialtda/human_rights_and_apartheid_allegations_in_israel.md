The ongoing [[conflict_in_israel_and_palestine|conflict in Israel and Palestine]] is viewed by some as a massacre driven by imperialism and colonization, rather than solely a religious conflict [00:05:48]. This perspective emphasizes that the situation is not merely an 11-day event but rather a continuation of a 75-year historical stage [00:05:54].

## Historical Context and Allegations
The origins of the current situation are traced back to British imperialism, which, in its "divide and conquer" logic, fostered conditions for large-scale migration [00:06:16]. The First Zionist Congress in 1897 debated where Jewish people should migrate, considering geopolitical factors, natural resources (including oil), leading to a decision to intensify migration to Historical Palestine [00:06:35]. At the time, Historical Palestine was home to Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populations who coexisted, with Christians making up 10% and Jews 3% of the population [00:06:58].

However, this migration became an "unfair process" with international subsidies, which, while acknowledging the historical persecution of Jewish people, led to the perception of Zionism as a colonial ideology [00:07:15]. The idea of "a land without a people for a people without a land" changed as people already lived there [00:08:04]. Subsidies from wealthy European Jews, such as Baron Rothschild, facilitated land purchases that led to the expulsion of the native population and the domination of land, workforce, and production means by Zionist migration [00:08:15].

Tensions escalated significantly after World War I. The British Empire, engaging in opportunistic promises, initially offered the land to Arab leaders for a large Arab state but did not fulfill it [00:08:45]. Concurrently, the Balfour Declaration promised a home for the Jewish people, which some interpret as inherently denying the existing national state and necessitating the expulsion of indigenous people [00:09:09]. Zionist militias even allied with the British Empire to suppress a Palestinian rebellion between 1936 and 1939 [00:10:01].

### Post-World War II Developments
After World War II, the horrors of the Holocaust intensified international pressure for a Jewish state, further escalating tensions in Historical Palestine [01:11:03]. Zionist militias engaged in attacks, including the bombing of the King David Hotel, which killed 92 people and was later characterized as terrorism [00:11:32]. This led the British Empire to hand the issue over to the UN [00:11:50].

The UN partition plan (Resolution 181) allocated the largest, most arable, and resource-rich parts of the land to the State of Israel, leaving the Palestinian territory as a "patchwork quilt" [00:12:02]. When the British Mandate ended, the State of Israel was declared, but no Palestinian state, leading to what Palestinians call "al-Nakba" or "the great tragedy," involving the expulsion of 750,000 Arab families and the destruction of 520 villages [00:12:51].

The subsequent Arab-Israeli wars, such as the 1956 invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, continued a pattern of territorial expansion by Israel [00:13:45]. The 1967 Six-Day War resulted in Israel militarily occupying all of Jordan (West Bank), the Gaza Strip, the Syrian Golan Heights, and parts of Southern Lebanon, demonstrating an ongoing expansionist goal [01:15:02]. Even after the war, Israel continued military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip [01:15:42].

## Allegations of Apartheid and [[state_terrorism|State Terrorism]]
Allegations of [[role_and_impact_of_zionism|apartheid]] and state terrorism are prominent. The first Intifada, a dignified revolt guaranteed by international law against military occupation and colonization, was met with "immense brutality" by the Zionist State [01:16:33]. International law prohibits colonization, military occupation, populating occupied territory, and forcible displacement of civilians [01:16:39].

Organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch consider Israel's actions as a regime of colonization and [[role_and_impact_of_zionism|apartheid]] [01:41:00]. The International Criminal Court views Israel as a "criminal state internationally" that commits war crimes [01:29:10].

### Specific Practices Alleged as Apartheid
*   **Wall Construction**: Israel built a 700 km wall, with 85% of it inside the occupied territories of the West Bank, displacing people and converting land into military areas [02:22:31].
*   **Water Control**: Israel is accused of concretizing water sources in the West Bank, taking over arable lands and water reserves [02:22:47].
*   **Military Checkpoints**: Movement within Palestinian territory is restricted by military checkpoints resembling "slaughterhouses," operating under gun sights and high surveillance [02:22:57].
*   **Legal Disparities**: There's a difference in criminal responsibility age (18 for Israelis, 12 for Palestinians) and the existence of "administrative detention" where Palestinians can be held for months without knowing the charges [03:32:44].
*   **Population Growth and Evictions**: Israel reportedly introduced the concept of "demographic war" to prevent Palestinian majorities in any region, leading to forced evictions [02:40:07].
*   **Political Rights**: Arab Israelis reportedly cannot legally organize a true party that questions colonization or [[role_and_impact_of_zionism|apartheid]] [02:41:39].
*   **LGBTQ+ Rights**: The Palestinian LGBT movement prioritizes ending foreign occupation as it violates their rights more severely than internal religious fundamentalism [02:48:19].
*   **Environmental Control**: Israel performs aerial fumigation of pesticides in the Gaza region to destroy Palestinian plantations and restricts building infrastructure like cisterns or greenhouses [02:49:49].

## Criticisms of Counter-Arguments
The claim that there's no oil in the region or that Israel has not engaged in [[ethnic_cleansing|ethnic cleansing]] is disputed [03:52:13]. While Israel discovered gas, the initial Zionist plan considered the region's natural resources [03:57:56]. The statement that the Palestinian population has grown is acknowledged, but it's argued that measuring genocide by population growth is a "eugenic dynamic" that normalizes ethnic cleansing [02:39:09].

The narrative that Israel is a helpless state in the Western world is attributed to an effective "Zionist Lobby" [01:20:09]. Similarly, the idea that Israel is the most LGBTQ+ friendly or vegan country is seen as marketing that distracts from the ongoing occupation and violence [02:47:59].

## Call for Action
To achieve true peace, several fundamental steps are proposed:
1.  **End the Genocide**: The first and foremost step is to immediately stop the ongoing [[conflict_in_israel_and_palestine|genocide]] [02:54:30].
2.  **End Military Occupation**: Israel should immediately withdraw from occupied territories to the 1967 borders, unconditionally, without limiting Palestinian sovereignty or their right to self-defense [02:55:38].
3.  **Decolonization**: The region must undergo decolonization, eliminating the idea of racial or ethnic supremacy [03:01:47].
4.  **UN Peace Mission**: A deep UN peace mission is necessary to prevent a catastrophic regional war, similar to its role in 1956 in the Sinai region [03:02:26].

This perspective emphasizes that solidarity with the Palestinian people is a humanitarian issue and a struggle of humanity, akin to past fights against [[role_and_impact_of_zionism|apartheid]], slavery, and racial segregation [03:03:50].

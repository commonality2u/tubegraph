From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

Internet criticism and hate are pervasive issues for content creators, often leading to significant personal and professional challenges. The digital landscape, particularly social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube, can amplify negativity, distort intentions, and foster toxic "bubbles" where misinformation thrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>.

## Initial Encounters with Criticism

Early in his career, the speaker, who is often referred to as Pedro or PT, encountered his first major legal issue due to an online joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>. After returning to Brazil from the United States, he received a police notification to appear at the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>. This was due to someone being "pissed off" because he had "mocked a religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. He explained that he used the name "Dark Side" (a DC Comics villain) in a joke, which was misinterpreted as mocking Candombl√© <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>, leading to an accusation of a crime against religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:37">[01:52:37]</a>. This incident highlights the [[challenges_in_navigating_controversial_humor | challenges in navigating controversial humor]] and the potential for severe backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.

## Facing Accusations and Legal Threats

The speaker recounts multiple instances of public criticism and legal challenges:

### The "Dark Side" Controversy
The incident involving the "Dark Side" joke escalated to the federal police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>, with the police attempting to understand the nature of the "villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. This legal encounter, which involved explaining a comic book character to a police delegate, underscored the absurdity and stress of online misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. The speaker views this as a "terrible scene" but also something he learned from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>.

### Harassment Allegations
In 2016, amidst widespread discussions of harassment, the speaker made a video commenting on an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:24">[01:47:24]</a>. While he believed he was giving his opinion without offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>, he later recognized it as potentially crossing a line, likening the perceived behavior in the video to a "drunk at the bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. He deeply regrets this video, admitting he felt "shame" upon re-watching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. This incident became a source of [[public_perceptions_and_controversies | public perceptions and controversies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:21">[01:47:21]</a>.

### Political Commentary and Backlash
The speaker notes that his political opinions have often led to criticism, stating that he doesn't "buy politics" and believes the president "talks a lot of nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:44">[01:42:44]</a>. He argues that online detractors will always "strive to distort and make it wrong" regardless of his intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>. He cites an instance where his comment about a robber showing affection to a dog was twisted into him endorsing dog kicking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>, leading to significant backlash and retweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a>. He views this as a way for others to "pour out the hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a> and often attributed to "envy" or "competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:12">[01:59:12]</a>. This highlights the [[discussion_on_political_ideologies_and_critiques | discussion on political ideologies and critiques]] in online spaces.

### Content Copying Accusations
The speaker also faced accusations of copying other YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>. While admitting to being inspired by successful formats and adapting them for the Brazilian audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>, he dismisses claims of direct plagiarism, especially when he adds unique information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:31">[02:11:31]</a>. He laments that people sometimes waste "more time copying than making original content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:54">[02:11:54]</a>.

## The Nature of Online Criticism and Social Media

### Toxic Bubbles and Misinformation
The speaker describes the internet as being full of "toxic and addictive" networks like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:48">[02:51:48]</a>, where people tend to form "bubbles" and attack those outside their echo chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. He believes many criticisms are based on "lies" and "inventions" spread on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:18">[01:58:18]</a>. He notes that people often "strive to distort" information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>, and that false accusations can go viral, leading to lasting negative [[public_perceptions_and_controversies | public perceptions and controversies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. This reflects the broader [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_internet_culture | impact of social media and internet culture]] on discourse.

### Cancellation Culture
He defines "cancellation" not as simple criticism but as something that "actually harms a person's career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>. He argues that often, what is perceived as "cancellation" merely "inflames your own bubble" while simultaneously attracting a new audience that goes "against that movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>. He believes that those who try to "cancel" others are often "envious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

> "For me, whoever tries to cancel is always an envious person, is always someone who has problems." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>

## Strategies for Coping with Criticism

### Ignoring and Silencing
Initially, the speaker found it difficult to ignore criticism, especially on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. He tried to delete old tweets and set an auto-delete for posts older than 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:17">[02:53:17]</a>. While recognizing the platform's addictive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:07">[02:52:07]</a>, he eventually decided to cancel his Twitter account to avoid the negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>, though he later returned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:54">[02:51:54]</a>. He states that he tries to "silence" critics to avoid bothering himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:34">[02:54:34]</a>.

### Self-Reflection and Apology
The speaker believes in the right to change one's view of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a> and regrets specific past mistakes, such as the harassment video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. He offered a "sincere apology" on Twitter for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. He differentiates between honest mistakes and malicious intent, stating he has "done stupid things" but is not a "bad guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>.

### Engaging with Critics
While generally preferring to avoid direct confrontation, he mentions occasions where he has engaged with critics, aiming to clarify his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a>. He believes that if people were to "sit with me and talk for five minutes," many objections would break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:22]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of direct conversation over fragmented social media interactions to truly understand a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>.

> "People who are knowing more about you than simply seeing a clipping or a tweet... you can't know you from a Twitter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>

### Legal Action
For serious accusations, especially those crossing into criminal territory, he and his team pursue legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>. He doesn't seek money but demands an apology and for accusers to "be careful who you say longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>, emphasizing the impact on his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:49">[02:07:49]</a>. This demonstrates the use of legal avenues in response to online defamation and harassment, which can be linked to [[experiences_with_censorship_and_freedom_of_speech | freedom of speech]] limits.

### Focusing on Quality and Growth
Despite criticism, the speaker continues to invest in content quality, including writing, editing, scenery, and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. He believes that if his content lacked quality, it wouldn't achieve the high viewership numbers it does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>. He also emphasizes that he is always open to feedback from his audience, seeing it as a productive way to improve his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>.

## Evolution and Perspective

Over time, the speaker's perspective on criticism has evolved. He acknowledges that the world is changing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:37">[01:51:37]</a>, and what was acceptable a few years ago might not be today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>. He believes everyone has the right to evolve and change their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>. While he doesn't want to start fights or tie himself to old controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>, he faces challenges common to [[challenges_of_being_a_comedian | comedians]] and content creators.

He encourages people to focus on their own work and not be consumed by competition or negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>. He aims to be a positive influence, helping others succeed in digital marketing and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>. He views his ability to help others achieve their goals as a fulfilling aspect of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:01">[02:34:01]</a>. Ultimately, he finds peace in his personal life and the ability to continue his work despite online attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:17">[02:39:17]</a>.

## Pablo Marçal's Candidacy: Motivation and Vision

Pablo Marçal decided to run for president on January 28, driven by a belief that Brazil is "led by people that doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He feels it's nonsensical to maintain his current life while the country is governed by those he deems "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Marçal states his goal is not merely to compete, but to win the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He notes that 60% of the population, according to polls, does not wish for the return of either [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Lula or Bolsonaro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He alleges that [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Lula and Bolsonaro]] have a "personal agreement" to face each other in a second round without anyone else challenging them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Marçal emphasizes the personal sacrifice involved in his candidacy, including convincing his family and business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. He states that his revenue has stopped growing for the first time in 15 years since engaging in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, and he is selling one of his companies at six times below its invested value for "total dedication in public life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He views his decision as "altruistic," aiming to serve the nation during what he perceives as its "best days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Brazil's Potential and Current Challenges
Marçal believes Brazil has immense potential due to its natural resources, including the largest fresh water reserves and significant agricultural production that feeds over a billion people annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. He points out the country's lack of natural disasters like earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For him, the primary challenge is the "mentality" of the population, which he aims to change, not to make everyone think alike, but to encourage individual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. He asserts that Brazil is not "condemned" to be governed by either [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Lula or Bolsonaro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Campaign Strategies and Public Perception

### Leveraging Visibility
Marçal sees his political engagement as a way to convert public attention into support, even embracing media "cancellation" as a means to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. He claims that negative media coverage, such as a "Fantástico" report, actually boosted his sales by 20 million reais due to the increased visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. He says he intentionally uses "tuner" moments to generate attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. He emphasizes that he doesn't seek to "please" anyone other than his wife and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

### Mixing Politics and Faith
Marçal believes that politics and faith are "completely antagonistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. However, he also asserts his freedom to express his faith, stating that he is "not religious" but believes in connecting to a higher power, drawing on the Latin root of "religare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. He states that Christianity is not a religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. He uses faith-based language and examples, which are questioned by his interlocutor, who views the mix as "dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. He criticizes pastors who engage in politics, stating they should focus on their churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. He recounts an instance where he prayed for a woman in a wheelchair during an event with 16,000 attendees and 55,000 online, which resulted in media controversy, though he insists he believes in miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. He expresses regret for the media exposure of the woman rather than the prayer itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

### Political Affiliations and Labels
Marçal distances himself from traditional left/right political labels, stating that "Brazil has seventy percent who don't care" about such divisions, focusing instead on practical needs like jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>. He argues that politicians are too caught up in these distinctions, hindering progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:46">[02:07:46]</a>. He criticizes [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] for criminalizing success and prosperity, and promises to issue a decree on his first day as president to "decriminalize success and prosperity," allowing Brazilians to "thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

## Government Plans and Reforms

### Economic Management
Marçal proposes to address Brazil's significant internal debt, stating he knows how to negotiate it by offering substantial discounts to debt holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>. He highlights that 80% of the national budget goes to "old" but active and inactive public servants and social security, which he calls a "poorly spent court order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. His priority is the pension system, which he believes is currently "withering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:45">[02:47:45]</a>.

He advocates for the privatization of state-owned companies like Petrobras, which he claims is making excessive profits (38% of oil companies globally yield 6-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02">[03:59:02]</a>. He suggests fragmenting Petrobras into multiple companies to foster competition and activate more refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. He also foresees a future where internal combustion cars become obsolete by 2030, necessitating a shift in Brazil's energy matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:49">[03:59:49]</a>.

Regarding taxation, Marçal proposes an "electronic tax" but clarifies that his plan is "not to increase taxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. He criticizes the current high tax burden and states that current government policies have led to inflation and a high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>. He states that taxes should be lowered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>

### Infrastructure and Industry
He notes that Brazil has 22,000 stalled infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:36">[02:37:36]</a>. He proposes increasing Brazil's railway network from 30,000 km to at least 200,000 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:22">[02:49:22]</a>, and developing multimodal transport systems to improve logistics and reduce reliance on roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:20">[02:48:20]</a>. He also highlights Brazil's vast reserves of niobium and graphene, advocating for their strategic development and control over pricing on international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:41">[02:57:41]</a>.

Marçal plans to stimulate entrepreneurship and business creation, especially in e-commerce, by creating a "digital Federal University" with no physical presence, funded by redirecting resources from existing federal universities that he claims lack demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:23">[02:15:23]</a>. He also proposes charging tuition for public universities for those who can afford it, to "oxygenate education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

### Public Safety
Marçal identifies poorly monitored borders as the root cause of the weapons and drug problems in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. He proposes unifying police systems, valuing police officers, and reforming the 82-year-old penal code to include "punishability exclusion and resocialization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. He advocates for teaching a "system of reward and punishment" from early childhood education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:46">[02:45:46]</a>. He also supports gun ownership for self-defense, particularly for rural families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:55">[02:48:55]</a>. He believes that if citizens were armed, the current homicide rates of 40,000 per year would not be tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:33">[02:43:33]</a>.

### Political Reforms
Marçal emphasizes the need to reform the political system, which he believes is currently characterized by "corruption" and a lack of effective management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>. He critiques the current model where politicians are not held accountable for their promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>. He proposes a "federal government portal with best practices" to reward financially the most effective rulers and ideas, to professionalize public management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>. He also states that he would commit to not seeking re-election on his first day as president as a pledge to enable comprehensive electoral reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:20">[02:53:20]</a>.

## Inspirations and Criticisms

Marçal draws inspiration from Juscelino Kubitschek, who he claims was the only Brazilian president to fulfill 100% of his government program by moving the capital to Brasília <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

He criticizes [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] for appropriating the hope of many people and then "destroying their team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. He also criticizes the "cultural Marxism" that he believes has infiltrated various aspects of society, leading to a division of the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:53">[01:56:53]</a>. He sees his role as ending "communism" and promoting capitalism and individual freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02">[01:57:02]</a>.

From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

Occultism, derived from the Latin *occultus* meaning "hidden," refers to a body of knowledge that is veiled because it is not intended for the majority of people, rather for those who are initiated [07:23:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:25">[07:23:25]</a>, [09:09:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:03">[09:09:03]</a>). It is distinct from the common misconception of being inherently "dark" or "satanic" [07:20:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:20">[07:20:20]</a>, [07:23:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:25">[07:23:25]</a>). Many artists and figures in pop culture have incorporated, or been influenced by, [[Historical Context of Secret Societies and Mysticism | occult]] practices, symbols, and philosophies.

## Occultism in Broader Culture

Occultism is widely present in general media and [[Music and spirituality | pop culture]], including films, comics, and songs [07:13:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:16">[07:13:16]</a>, [07:46:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>). This presence often involves esoteric or hidden messages within more explicit works [07:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, [07:59:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>).

### Defining "Satan," "Demon," and "Lucifer"

The terms "Satan," "Demon," and "Lucifer" often carry negative connotations in modern understanding, but their original meanings are different within historical and mystical contexts:
*   **Satan (Hebrew: *Lessat√£*)** is originally defined as "opponent" or "adversary" [23:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>, [29:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>). In the earliest books of the Hebrew Bible (like Numbers and First Samuel), "Satan" refers to an angel placed by God as an adversary to Balaam, or to King David being considered an adversary by the Philistines [25:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>, [26:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>, [27:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>). The concept of Satan as an entity of evil, separate from God, emerged later due to the influence of Zoroastrian dualism on Jewish exiles in Babylon [38:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>, [39:53:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>).
*   **Demon (Greek: *Daimon*)** in Greek philosophy referred to good spirits, elemental beings, or genii of nature (e.g., spirits of fire, water, earth, and air) [48:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>, [48:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>). Socrates, for example, spoke of a *daimon* inspiring him [48:26:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>). The negative connotation of "demon" largely originated from the Catholic Church's demonization of Greek culture and pagan deities [50:53:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>, [51:17:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:00">[51:17:00]</a>).
*   **Lucifer** is a Greco-Roman deity, not a biblical figure in the Old Testament [53:58:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>, [54:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:00">[54:18:00]</a>). The name "Lucifer" appears in the Bible's Book of Isaiah as a metaphor, referring to the "morning star" (planet Venus) and a prophecy about the fall of the proud King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon [56:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09:00">[56:09:00]</a>, [01:00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12:00">[01:00:12:00]</a>). Venus, as the morning star, was seen as a "light-bringer" (Greek: *Phosphoros*, Latin: *Lucifer*) that announced the sun's arrival [01:02:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01:00">[01:02:01:00]</a>, [01:02:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06:00">[01:02:06:00]</a>). Ancient Greco-Romans associated Lucifer with passion, instinct, beauty, and seduction [01:06:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18:00">[01:06:18:00]</a>, [01:06:20:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20:00">[01:06:20:00]</a>). The "War in Heaven" and "Fallen Angels" narratives originate from texts like the Book of Enoch, not the Bible [01:02:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32:00">[01:02:32:00]</a>, [01:04:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00:00">[01:04:00:00]</a>).

## [[Music and spirituality | Occultism in Music]]

Many artists and bands have explicitly, or implicitly, incorporated [[Historical Context of Secret Societies and Mysticism | occult]] and mystical elements into their work, believing it enhances creativity and success. This often stems from engagement with various esoteric traditions:

### Influential Figures and Concepts

*   **Alan Moore**: The acclaimed comic book writer is an initiate in a school of occultism and Kabbalah [06:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>). His work, such as *V for Vendetta*, incorporates themes of chaos theory and occult references [06:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, [07:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>).
*   **Chaos Magic**: A system of magic that encourages individuals to create their own magical practices, mixing elements from various esoteric traditions rather than adhering to rigid orthodoxies [08:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, [09:34:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>). This approach allows for the impregnation of objects with personal energy and the creation of unique sigils (symbols created by a magician from their unconscious) [09:16:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, [09:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>).
*   **Aleister Crowley**: A highly influential figure in modern occultism, Crowley founded the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and developed Thelema [02:18:53:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:53:00">[02:18:53:00]</a>, [02:25:58:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:58:00">[02:25:58:00]</a>). His "Book of the Law" influenced the thinking of many magicians and artists [02:25:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28:00">[02:25:28:00]</a>, [02:25:31:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:31:00">[02:25:31:00]</a>). Crowley's work on the Abramelin ritual, which involves confronting one's inner "shadows" or unconscious "demons," is notable [02:28:16:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16:00">[02:28:16:00]</a>, [02:31:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:49:00">[02:31:49:00]</a>).
*   **John Dee**: A 16th-century mathematician and spiritual advisor to the British royal family (Queen Elizabeth I), John Dee developed Enochian magic to communicate with "angels" (astral beings) [02:56:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:47:00">[02:56:47:00]</a>, [03:01:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:30:00">[03:01:30:00]</a>). His work, such as *Monas Hieroglyphica*, describes alchemical processes of the soul and universe using symbols [02:55:50:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:50:00">[02:55:50:00]</a>, [02:59:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04:00">[02:59:04:00]</a>).

### Specific Artists and Their Connections

*   **The Beatles**: Considered by some to be the "most satanic band of Maroon Five Universe History" [01:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>). Their album *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* features Aleister Crowley on its cover, and band members like John Lennon were interested in Crowley and Golden Dawn [02:48:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, [02:50:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, [02:50:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:10:00">[02:50:10:00]</a>).
*   **Led Zeppelin**: The band's guitarist, Jimmy Page, was a devotee of Aleister Crowley, even purchasing Crowley's Boleskine House near Loch Ness [02:26:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:18:00">[02:26:18:00]</a>, [02:26:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30:00">[02:26:30:00]</a>). Page sought to perform the Abramelin ritual there to accelerate a spiritual process [02:27:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04:00">[02:27:04:00]</a>, [02:30:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30:00">[02:30:30:00]</a>). The band's personal symbols, which appear on their fourth album, are also rooted in esoteric traditions, including astrological symbols and references from ancient magical texts [02:37:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:02:00">[02:37:02:00]</a>, [02:38:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:08:00">[02:38:08:00]</a>). The band's lyrics, especially from the album *Led Zeppelin III*, were said to have reverse messages, particularly from Crowley's "Book of the Law" [02:42:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:49:00">[02:42:49:00]</a>, [02:43:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00:00">[02:43:00:00]</a>).
*   **Rolling Stones**: Also influenced by Crowley and the occult [02:19:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00:00">[02:19:00:00]</a>, [02:42:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00:00">[02:42:00:00]</a>).
*   **Madonna**: Known to be a Kabbalist and has a song titled "Illuminati," which addresses themes of reinvention and a "new world" (referring to the New Age of Aquarius) [02:02:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:54:00">[02:02:54:00]</a>, [02:09:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09:00">[02:09:09:00]</a>, [02:10:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09:00">[02:10:09:00]</a>, [02:13:07:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:07:00">[02:13:07:00]</a>).
*   **Katy Perry**: Her music video "Dark Horse" features the "Eye of Horus," a strong symbol associated with the Illuminati, Freemasonry, Golden Dawn, and Hermetic societies [02:22:42:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42:00">[02:22:42:00]</a>, [02:23:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01:00">[02:23:01:00]</a>).
*   **Jay-Z and Rihanna**: These artists often make symbols of recognition, such as the pyramid with the eye or a triangle above the head, indicating their association with or initiation into orders like the Golden Dawn or O.T.O. [02:21:29:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:29:00">[02:21:29:00]</a>, [02:22:31:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31:00">[02:22:31:00]</a>).
*   **Matu√™**: A modern artist whose songs allude to ritual rhythms and numbers like "777" and "666," linked to Thelemic rituals [02:13:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13:00">[02:13:13:00]</a>, [02:13:22:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:22:00">[02:13:22:00]</a>). The number 666, often associated with the Antichrist, is a kabbalistic number related to the solar element Tiphareth and symbolizes balance within the hexagram [01:45:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:33:00">[01:45:33:00]</a>, [01:48:44:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44:00">[01:48:44:00]</a>).
*   **Raul Seixas**: A prominent enthusiast of Thelema in Brazil [02:13:07:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:07:00">[02:13:07:00]</a>, [02:13:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10:00">[02:13:10:00]</a>).
*   **Anitta**: Her involvement with Candombl√©, an Afro-Brazilian religion, is sometimes misunderstood as a "pact with the devil" [02:15:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57:00">[02:15:57:00]</a>, [02:17:25:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:25:00">[02:17:25:00]</a>). However, it is an act of spiritual agreement or alliance with an *Orix√°* (a deity or spirit in Candombl√©), particularly Oxum, who is associated with arts and beauty [02:17:05:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05:00">[02:17:05:00]</a>, [02:17:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18:00">[02:17:18:00]</a>, [02:17:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28:00">[02:17:28:00]</a>).
*   **Gl√≥ria Groove and Pabllo Vittar**: Both artists use symbols associated with John Dee's *Monas Hieroglyphica*, a 16th-century alchemical text [02:53:21:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:21:00">[02:53:21:00]</a>, [02:55:48:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:48:00">[02:55:48:00]</a>). Their visual imagery, featuring a crescent moon and a sun-like symbol, is a partial representation of Dee's esoteric sigil, often omitting the solar element to emphasize the feminine [02:54:40:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40:00">[02:54:40:00]</a>, [02:55:35:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:35:00">[02:55:35:00]</a>, [02:55:41:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:41:00">[02:55:41:00]</a>).
*   **Iron Maiden**: Bruce Dickinson, the band's vocalist, is a profound connoisseur of esoteric topics, having written screenplays related to Aleister Crowley and incorporating Thelemic themes in his songs [02:41:40:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40:00">[02:41:40:00]</a>, [02:41:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:47:00">[02:41:47:00]</a>). The sigil of Astaroth is visible on the cover of his "Best of 2001" album [02:41:31:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:31:00">[02:41:31:00]</a>).

### Misconceptions and Interpretations

Many bands and artists do not make "pacts with the devil" in the conventional sense, as the concept of "the devil" is not inherent in all spiritual traditions [02:15:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:45:00">[02:15:45:00]</a>, [02:15:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:47:00">[02:15:47:00]</a>). Instead, they engage in spiritual agreements or alliances with energetic entities to gain success, fortune, and prosperity, a practice that has existed throughout human history [02:16:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:45:00">[02:16:45:00]</a>, [02:17:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09:00">[02:17:09:00]</a>). These practices are often rooted in specific traditions like Kabbalah, Hermeticism, or indigenous spiritual paths [02:16:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:56:00">[02:16:56:00]</a>, [02:17:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28:00">[02:17:28:00]</a>).

The influence of occultism in popular culture also extends to:
*   **Anime and Cartoons**: Naruto's mastery over the Kyubi (a nine-tailed beast) symbolizes a wizard's journey to integrate and control their inner "demon" or subconscious energies [03:05:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:04:00">[03:05:04:00]</a>, [03:05:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:15:00">[03:05:15:00]</a>). Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can be interpreted kabbalistically, with the dwarfs representing the seven vices and virtues that the unconscious (Snow White) must transmute to achieve wisdom and balance [03:05:35:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:35:00">[03:05:35:00]</a>, [03:07:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01:00">[03:07:01:00]</a>). Walt Disney himself was said to have attained the 33rd degree of Freemasonry, symbolizing the connection between the earthly and spiritual aspects of human existence [03:07:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:32:00">[03:07:32:00]</a>, [03:08:42:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:42:00">[03:08:42:00]</a>).
*   **Star Wars and RPGs**: While commonly mislabeled as "from the devil," these works often contain rich archetypal and philosophical elements that can be interpreted through a mystical lens [03:08:46:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:46:00">[03:08:46:00]</a>, [03:09:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01:00">[03:09:01:00]</a>). For instance, the betrayal of the Jedi in Star Wars draws parallels to the historical betrayal of the Knights Templar by the Catholic Church [02:01:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47:00">[02:01:47:00]</a>, [02:02:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01:00">[02:02:01:00]</a>).
*   **[[The influence of historical rituals and symbols in modern times | Historical Rituals and Symbols]]**: Elements like the Jewish menorah, the Holy Grail (a pagan symbol of feminine energy and creation), and the origins of Easter and Christmas celebrations are examples of [[Cultural and societal influences on spirituality | ancient pagan]] or mystical elements absorbed and recontextualized by later religious institutions [02:11:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13:00">[02:11:13:00]</a>, [02:11:19:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:19:00">[02:11:19:00]</a>), [02:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>), [02:13:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30:00">[02:13:30:00]</a>), [02:14:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:45:00">[02:14:45:00]</a>).

Overall, the influence of occultism in music and pop culture demonstrates a continuous human engagement with hidden knowledge, symbols, and spiritual practices, often transcending conventional religious boundaries and impacting creative expression.

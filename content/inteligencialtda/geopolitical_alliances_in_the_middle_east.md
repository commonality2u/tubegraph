The complex web of [[the_strategic_implications_of_international_alliances | international alliances]] and rivalries significantly shapes the Middle East's [[global_political_tensions | global political tensions]]. Recent events, particularly the Hamas attack on Israel, have highlighted existing alignments and complicated ongoing peace processes.

## Key Alliances and Relationships

### The Axis of Resistance
Iran is described as a primary backer of several [[islamic_extremism_and_middle_eastern_conflicts | terrorist groups]] in the region, forming what is known as the "Axis of Resistance" (or "Mukama" in Arabic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:50">[02:35:50]</a>.
*   **Hamas**: Iran has supported, financed, and provided training and weapons to Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>. Meetings involving Iran's Revolutionary Guard (Quds Force) and Hamas leaders have been ongoing since April, with Iran's Foreign Affairs Minister participating at the highest government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. The recent Hamas attack, which was a "suicide mission" from their perspective, was given a "green light" by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Hezbollah**: Hezbollah, a powerful organization in Lebanon, is literally an "arm of the Iranian regime," described as Iran's "combat armed and ready militia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Islamic Jihad**: This is another Palestinian [[islamic_extremism_and_middle_eastern_conflicts | terrorist group]] operating in Gaza and Jordan, considered worse than Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   **Other Support**: Hamas has also received support from Qatar and Türkiye at various levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>.

### Israel and its Allies
The United States has a strong alliance with Israel.
*   **U.S. Support**: The U.S. demonstrates its support by sending aircraft carriers and weapons to the region, signaling that Israel is not vulnerable and deterring other countries or groups from attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This is a show of strength to dissuade further joint attacks on Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Israel's Determination**: Israel is highly unified following the recent attacks, with all political parties forming a single consensus government to defend the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. The Israeli identity is deeply forged in combat and the fight for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.

### Potential Peace Processes and Disruptions
Efforts toward broader peace in the Middle East have been complicated by recent events.
*   **Israel-Saudi Arabia Agreement**: Prior to the Hamas attack, an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia was progressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. This potential agreement bothered the "Axis of Resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
    *   The peace process between Israel and Arab countries was seen as a precursor to peace with the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:39">[01:55:39]</a>.
    *   Saudi Arabia knows Hamas is not a benign actor and has concerns about extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:24">[01:54:24]</a>. They initially issued a neutral statement on the recent conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37">[01:54:37]</a>.
    *   Saudi Arabia has a strategic interest in technology from Israel (e.g., cyber, irrigation) for its "Vision 2030" mega-cities, which could indirectly benefit Palestinians by giving Saudi Arabia influence within the Israeli government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Palestinian Leadership's Role**: The Palestinian population in Gaza suffers due to the actions of Hamas, not Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. Historically, Palestinian leadership has made "wrong decisions" that have harmed their people, such as rejecting peace agreements in 1937, 1947, 1967, 2000, and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. Israel has offered total withdrawal from most settlements and land exchanges in peace proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:09">[02:51:09]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Hamas's Actions**: The recent attack is considered a "shot in the foot" for the Palestinian cause, as it leads to financial aid cuts (e.g., European Union cut 600 million per year to the Palestinian Authority) and damages their image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. It benefits the Iranian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Implications

### Iran's Nuclear Program
The attack by Hamas is expected to lead to a more serious stance on Iran's nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:26">[01:59:26]</a>.
*   Israel has long sought to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, using methods like cyberattacks and assassinations of scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:39">[01:59:39]</a>.
*   There is a strong conviction that Israel will launch a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities if Iran is close to developing a bomb, with or without U.S. aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>.
*   An [[potential_global_and_regional_escalations | atomic Iran]] would create immense instability, potentially leading other regional powers like Türkiye, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia to seek nuclear weapons, escalating the risk of nuclear terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>.
*   Russia and China, while historically having concerns about nuclear proliferation, might now view Iran having an atomic bomb as beneficial for their own "axis" against democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:32">[02:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>.

### Shifting Global Dynamics
The conflict highlights a deepening division between dictatorships and democracies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:36">[02:05:36]</a>.
*   The world is experiencing a "convergence of crises and problems," including war between states, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, instability, populism, and polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:21">[02:55:21]</a>.
*   Social media and [[the_role_of_technology_and_communication_in_geopolitics | technology]] accelerate these changes, causing events to unfold rapidly and problems to affect one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:20">[02:57:20]</a>.
*   The return of [[islamic_extremism_and_middle_eastern_conflicts | terrorism]] as a major threat, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, adds to the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:57">[02:55:57]</a>.

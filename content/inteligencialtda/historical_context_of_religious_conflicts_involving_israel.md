The current [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | war in Israel]] is viewed by some as an alarming event from an eschatological perspective, indicating a rapid progression of global events, including the war in Ukraine and other "volcano events" [00:05:40].

## Eschatological View of Global Conflicts

From an eschatological viewpoint, the current situation in Israel is seen as critical because it aligns with a prediction that a Third World War would occur between Israel and the Palestinians, or Arabs in general [00:06:27]. This conflict is believed by some to be a precursor to the establishment of an antichrist government [00:06:30].

An ex-Satanist named Doc Marx, who wrote "The Secret of the Illuminati," claims that on January 22, 1870, Albert Pike, considered a "pope of Freemasonry," received a vision detailing how a new world order needed to be established [00:07:09]. This vision outlined a multi-century plan for a single global government, currency, and religion [00:08:05].

According to this theory, three world wars are necessary for the new world order to be established on a global scale [00:09:33]. These wars operate on a "thesis battling against antithesis so that synthesis may arise" model [00:09:52]:

*   **First World War**: Aimed to overthrow the Tsarist Russian government because it resisted the implementation of a central bank [00:10:30]. This war's purpose was to establish a militarist, atheist, and communist nation, as foretold 22 years after Karl Marx's "Communist Manifesto" [00:10:54]. Lenin received financial support from the world's banking elite for the communist revolution [00:11:24].
*   **Second World War**: Its objective was to strengthen this communist nation (the Soviet Union) into a superpower capable of destroying other nations and religions [00:12:21]. The persecution of religions, including Christian and Jewish faiths, in the Soviet Union is cited as evidence [00:13:02]. This conflict created the "antithesis" (communism) to capitalism (the "thesis"), leading to the Cold War and a global polarization [00:14:46].
*   **Third World War**: Predicted to begin between Jews and Arabs [00:16:12]. This prediction, made in 1870 when Israel was not yet a state, suggests that from the "ashes of the chaos" of this war, a "super man," a leader, would emerge to offer economic and social solutions and bring peace [00:17:09]. The current events in Israel are viewed as setting the stage for this [00:17:28].

## Current [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | Conflict in Israel]]

The recent explosion of war in Israel, particularly the actions of Hamas, is described as having "a level of atrocity and cruelty never seen before" in the current generation, evoking scenes reminiscent of the holocaust [00:17:50]. Hamas is accused of attacking civilians, kidnapping, killing elderly people, beheading babies, molesting children, and raping women [00:18:18]. Israel's response is seen as an unavoidable necessity to counter these terrorist acts, recover civilians, destroy the terrorist group, and prevent a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia that extremist groups do not desire [00:19:08].

The danger of the current [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | conflict]] escalating is high, with Hezbollah already at the border of Lebanon [00:20:42]. The biggest threat, however, is the United States entering the war if Iran, which has financed terrorist groups, becomes directly involved [00:20:57]. If the United States enters, Russia, which provides military care to Iran, could also join, potentially triggering a world war [02:14:02].

## The Spiritual Root of Extremism

The current conflict is seen as a spiritual war, rooted in religious reasons between Jews and fundamentalist Islam [02:22:10]. It's important to note that not every Islamic country is Arab, and not every Muslim is radical [00:22:25]. Research suggests only 15% to 20% of Muslims are extremists, but this still translates to about 320 million radicals globally [02:23:28].

Islam is identified as the fastest-growing religion worldwide, partly due to higher fertility rates among Muslim women compared to those in traditionally Christian countries, leading to cultural transformation and "Islamization" in places like Europe [02:26:09]. Radical Islam believes that Islam must be the only religion in the world, viewing adherents of other religions as "infidels" [02:25:10]. This leads to severe persecution of Christians and Jews, as seen in the burning of churches in India by fundamentalist Muslims [02:55:00].

The deep-seated radicalism against Israel stems from a theology created by an Islamic fundamentalist leader named Al-Mawardi around 1,000 years BC [02:32:42]. This theology divides the world into:
*   *Dar al-Islam* (House of Islam): Lands ruled by Islam [02:33:08].
*   *Dar al-Harb* (House of Sword): Territories not ruled by Islam, which are to be conquered by jihad or "Holy War" [02:33:24].

Based on this, extremists never accepted the State of Israel because the land, once ruled by Islam (since 638 AD when Muslims conquered Jerusalem and built the Dome of the Rock on the site of Solomon's Temple), cannot be governed by non-Muslims [02:34:09]. This ideology explains why the radical factions want the "extermination of Israel" and do not accept a two-state solution [02:35:04]. Historically, Arab leaders have consistently voiced the goal of Israel's extermination [02:35:50].

## [[role_of_israel_in_biblical_history | Historical Claim to the Land]]

To understand the question of whose land it is, one must revert to biblical history, viewing the Holy Bible as a historical record [02:39:09].

*   **Divine Plan and Abraham**: God's original plan was for Earth to be an extension of heaven, populated by people who knew Him [02:39:24]. After humanity's fall from grace, God chose Abraham around 2000 BC, telling him to leave his land for a land God would show him [02:41:19]. This land was Canaan, which is present-day Palestine [02:42:01].
*   **Jacob and the 12 Tribes**: Abraham's descendants, through Isaac and Jacob, formed the 12 tribes of Israel [02:42:17]. Due to a famine, Joseph's family migrated to Egypt [02:44:40].
*   **Exodus and the Promised Land**: After 400 years of slavery in Egypt, God raised Moses to lead the Israelites back to the Promised Land, described as a "land flowing with milk and honey" [02:52:51]. Joshua, Moses' successor, led the conquest of this land from seven non-Palestinian nations [02:54:33].
*   **Jerusalem and the Temple**: King David founded Jerusalem, making it the indivisible capital of Israel [02:55:35]. King Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem on the site where the Dome of the Rock stands today [02:55:56].
*   **Babylonian Captivity and Roman Rule**: The First Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC, and the Jews were taken captive to Babylon [02:56:53]. The Second Temple was later built upon their return [02:57:31]. The Roman Empire conquered Judea in 64 BC, and in 70 AD, Romans destroyed the Second Temple during a Jewish revolt, leading to the death of 1 million Jews and many survivors becoming slaves [02:59:02].
*   **Diaspora and Persecution**: In 132 AD, another major revolt (Bar Kokhba revolt) against Emperor Hadrian led to nearly 600,000 Jews being killed [03:00:54]. Hadrian banned Jewish practices and renamed Jerusalem "Aelia Capitolina," leading to the widespread dispersion (diaspora) of Jews across continents for centuries [03:03:30]. Since 70 AD, Jews have faced persecution, resulting in 13 million deaths by the 20th century [03:04:45].

## Whose Land Is It Today?

After the diaspora, the land of Israel became a desert, with only a tiny Jewish remnant remaining [03:05:58]. In 638 AD, Arab Muslims conquered Jerusalem, establishing Islamic rule [03:06:16]. Later, the Crusades (1096-1291) aimed to reclaim the Holy Land for Christians, leading to Jerusalem being destroyed and rebuilt 14 times, making it the most destroyed and rebuilt city on Earth [03:07:08]. The Ottoman Turks governed the territory from 1517 to 1918 [03:07:52].

After WWI, the British gained control of Palestine, dividing it and preventing Jewish migration into Transjordan [03:08:12]. Jewish immigration to Western Palestine began in 1882 with Russian Jews forming kibbutzim (socialist communities) [03:08:47].

In 1948, with a UN resolution voted by Brazilian Osvaldo Aranha, Israel became a state [03:09:36]. While Palestinians have a right to statehood, extremist groups like Hamas seek the extermination of the Jewish people, making peace negotiations based on territory difficult [03:09:58].

The residents of Palestine today are primarily Arabs brought by the Ottoman Turkish Empire from other Arab countries [03:13:40]. The Gaza Strip, which belonged to Egypt from 1948 to 1967, was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War [03:14:03]. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew all 9,000 Jewish residents from Gaza in an attempt to achieve peace [03:14:45]. However, Hamas won the 2006 elections in Gaza and has since used the territory to attack Israel, launching rockets, building tunnels, and conducting terrorist acts [03:15:10].

The narrative in media often portrays Israel as the aggressor, despite Israel never starting a war but always defending itself [03:16:21]. Anti-Semitism is seen as returning, with people marking Jewish establishments with the Star of David, reminiscent of Nazism [03:17:03].

## Antichrist and the New World Order

The global polarization, evident in the support for Palestine from the far left and Israel from the right, is seen as a continuation of the thesis-antithesis dynamic that divides the world [03:37:53].

### Increase of Iniquity
Jesus prophesied that in the "end of times," love would grow cold due to the multiplication of iniquity (Matthew 24:12) [03:54:09]. Iniquity, from the Greek *anomia*, signifies disrespect for order, atheism, rebellion against law, contempt for God's law, and direct opposition to God [03:55:26]. This surge in wickedness has been progressively increasing in recent decades, notably after the 1968 cultural revolution [03:56:06].

### The 1968 Cultural Revolution
The 1968 student protests in Paris, initially over mixed-gender dorms, quickly escalated into a violent revolution that influenced similar movements globally, including Brazil [03:56:54]. This era marked a "gradual degradation of morals" that transformed Western culture, paving the way for an anti-Christian new world order [03:57:38].

Key aspects and influences:
*   **Vietnam War protests**: These represented the thesis-antithesis conflict (capitalism vs. communism) [03:58:23].
*   **Prague Spring**: The first practical application of a "socialist cultural revolution," infiltrating institutions like the state, media, and church instead of armed conflict [03:58:36]. This was conceptualized by Antonio Gramsci [04:07:44].
*   **Woodstock (1969)**: This music festival symbolized the counterculture era, celebrating the "Age of Aquarius," which was seen as the end of the "Age of Pisces" (Christianity) and the dawn of a new, mystical, anti-Christian era [04:09:56].
*   **Drug Use**: Influencers, like Harvard professor Timothy Leary, promoted drugs like LSD to "expand the mind," leading to millions of young people becoming addicted [04:20:10].
*   **Sexual Revolution**: A German psychiatrist's idea that sexual repression caused war led to the "make love, not war" motto and the promotion of "free sex," leading to moral degradation and depravity [04:21:50].
*   **Herbert Marcuse and the Frankfurt School**: Marcuse, a philosopher from the Frankfurt School, aimed to destroy Western culture, attack capitalism, and dismantle the religious dimension of life [04:25:55]. His ideas influenced universities, creating indoctrination centers for progressive thought [04:26:55]. Marcuse concluded that communism could not be implemented via proletarian revolt in America, so "outsiders" – students, artists, intellectuals – would be the new "transforming agents" [04:27:58].
*   **Predictive Programming**: The use of media (films, music, literature) to propagate ideas and "predict future events," such as the population reduction theme in "Avengers" or various "predictions" in "The Simpsons," to subtly shape public opinion [04:38:29].
*   **Musical Influence**: Bands like The Beatles (influenced by the counterculture's "Beatniks") and punk bands like Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedys [05:11:51] [05:15:30] used their music to spread socialist ideas, anti-establishment messages, and attacks on traditional values and capitalism [05:18:23]. Heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden introduced Satanism through music [05:34:50]. This period also fostered disrespect for parental authority [05:21:54].
*   **Attack on Family Values**: The rising divorce rates and destruction of the family unit are linked to theories by Marx's friend, Friedrich Engels. His book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" argued that the family, in its origin, was a patriarchal system of enslavement, thus a source of social inequality [05:26:40]. Therefore, to achieve social equality, the family unit must be dismantled [05:28:13]. This forms a "root" or "premise" for much of current progressive thought [05:28:36].

The consequence of this cultural shift is chronic depression and anxiety despite technological advancement and material wealth [05:31:07]. This is seen as proof that material satisfaction does not bring peace of mind, which can only be found through a relationship with God [05:33:33].

### Prophecy of Gog and Magog
The current geopolitical climate, particularly the potential involvement of Iran, Russia, and China against Israel, aligns with the prophecy of Gog and Magog in Ezekiel, written six centuries before Jesus [05:19:18]. Gog (the leader) from the land of Magog (the land north of Israel, identified as Russia) will form an alliance [05:26:09]. The prophecy mentions Persia (Iran), Put (Libya/North Africa), Gomer, and Togarma (European countries) as allies against Israel [05:31:33]. The prophecy states that God will intervene, leading to chaos among the attacking forces (their swords turning against each other), plague, and natural disasters, ensuring Israel's victory [05:43:08]. This is interpreted as God's continued effort to reveal Himself to humanity [05:44:21].

## The Illuminati and "False Jews"

The Illuminati are connected to a long-standing conspiracy, tracing back to the biblical narrative of Esau and Jacob [05:33:04].

### Esau and Edom
Isaac and Rebekah had twins, Jacob and Esau [05:38:48]. Even before their birth, God declared, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" (Romans 9:13, Malachi 1:2-3) [05:39:49]. This hatred is linked to Esau's descendants, the Edomites [05:40:51]. Esau, known as Edom (meaning "red"), was distinguished by his red appearance, the red lentil stew for which he sold his birthright, and the red sandstone of his land [05:45:49].

The Edomites had kings long before the Israelites and engaged in conflicts with Israel [05:46:04]. Esau's choice to marry Hittite women, who practiced a Luciferian religion involving child sacrifice and idol worship, caused "bitterness of spirit" to his parents [05:46:19]. The Hittites were wealthy power brokers and Satan worshipers [05:47:27]. This choice meant Esau's descendants inherited this worship of false gods and continued their hatred for Jacob's descendants (Israel) [05:47:51]. The Edomites even sided with the Babylonians in taking the Jews captive [05:48:42].

According to the historian Flavius Josephus, in 100-130 BC, John Hyrcanus forcibly converted the Edomites (Idumeans) to Judaism [05:49:11]. This allowed them to infiltrate Jewish society, taking positions of influence in government and religion [05:50:37]. King Herod, who ordered the killing of babies when Jesus was born, was an Idumean [05:50:31]. The Pharisees who opposed Jesus were also, according to some interpretations, converted Edomites [05:51:00]. This theory suggests a camouflaged enemy within Israel [05:51:12].

Prophecies in Obadiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah speak against the Edomites in the end times, describing them as proud and hiding [05:52:00]. The "fundamental trait of Esau" is that he is a "hunter," skilled in disguise and camouflage [05:52:23]. This means that the descendants of Edom are untraceable today, unlike the Jews and Arabs who know their lineage [05:52:41]. They camouflaged themselves within Jacob's house through forced Judaism [05:53:03].

Revelation 2:9 states, "I know the blasphemy of those who despise themselves and declare Jews and are not, but rather a synagogue of Satan" [05:53:29]. This is interpreted by some as referring to these "false Jews" or Edomites who outwardly profess Judaism but secretly worship Satan.

### Origins of the Illuminati
The Illuminati are believed to have originated from these movements:
*   **Sabbatarianism**: Founded by Kabbalist Rabbi Sabbatai Zevi in 1626, who claimed to be the Messiah [05:54:11]. This sect considered the God of scriptures as evil and Lucifer as good, stating that biblical commandments were no longer mandatory and that all sins were permitted to prepare for "Redemption" [05:54:52].
*   **Frankism**: Jacob Frank, another self-proclaimed Messiah, founded an underground sect in 1770 [05:56:13]. His adherents publicly followed Jewish law but secretly rejected it, dedicating themselves to forbidden sexual practices [05:56:21].

The Illuminati society was founded six years after Frankism by Adam Weishaupt [05:56:45]. The followers of Sabbatarianism and Frankism eventually followed the Illuminati [05:56:56]. They believe Sabbatai Zevi's soul transmigrated to the dynasty of 13 families who secretly control the global system [05:57:06]. One such family is the Rothschilds (originally *Mayer Amschel*), who established the modern banking system and control global finances [05:58:26]. Their family symbol was a red shield with six points, a symbol also used in Satanism [05:58:50]. This theory links the Rothschilds to the Edomite lineage ("red Edom") [05:59:28].

This control over money allows them to acquire and control media, Hollywood, and educational materials to shape global thought according to their desired culture [05:59:41]. Jeremiah 11:9 states, "a conspiracy was found among the men of Judah among the inhabitants of Jerusalem," suggesting such hidden plots are not new [06:00:24].

## Spiritual Significance of Current Events

The current alarming events are a call for reflection: "If life ends now, where am I going?" [06:20:25]. Life is seen as a passage, a test, and the soul has an eternal destiny [06:20:47]. Salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ, who is the "only mediator between God and men" [06:21:13].

### The Church's Role and the Five Ministries
The church is considered the "Embassy of the Kingdom of God on Earth" and God's representative, the "mouth of Jesus" [05:52:50]. It is the bride of Jesus, whom He will return to seek [05:53:17].

Ephesians 4:11 describes five ministries (offices) God left for the church:
1.  **Apostle**: A term borrowed from the Roman Empire, where apostles were ship captains sent to new territories to implement Roman culture [06:01:31]. Spiritually, apostles are God's envoys to nations, with authority to plant churches, establish God's kingdom, and unite the other ministries [06:02:17]. Examples include Paul and Barnabas [06:03:56].
2.  **Evangelist**: Brings people into the church by preaching the gospel and converting them [06:03:06].
3.  **Teacher**: Disciple and educate people about Jesus [06:03:12].
4.  **Pastor**: Cares for the flock, providing guidance and support [06:03:17].
5.  **Prophet**: Provides direction and works to fulfill prophecy [06:03:25].

These ministries were active in the Early Church, as seen in the Book of Acts [06:02:58]. However, during the Middle Ages, the church fell into "deep darkness," losing its spiritual power and becoming focused on political power [06:05:40].

*   **Protestant Reformation**: Restored the ministries of pastor and teacher through figures like Martin Luther, who challenged the sale of indulgences and emphasized salvation by grace [06:06:19].
*   **Evangelistic Restoration**: In the time of John Wesley, the evangelistic ministry was restored, leading to fervent missions and mass conversions [06:07:22].
*   **Prophetic and Apostolic Restoration**: In 1906, the Azusa Street Revival, led by William Seymour, marked the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the prophetic and apostolic ministries, including healings, signs, and miracles [06:07:40]. The church is meant to function in all five ministries as a cornerstone of Jesus and a model of the church of Acts [06:08:56]. The true apostle often suffers greatly for God's work [06:09:27].

### Rapture and Tribulation
The speaker holds a "pre-tribulation rapture" view, believing the church will be raptured (taken away) before the Great Tribulation [06:17:59]. This is based on analogies like Noah being saved in the ark before the flood and the divine character of God, who separates the wicked from the righteous in judgment [06:18:16]. For seven years, the raptured church will participate in the "wedding of the Lamb" with Jesus while "the playground will be on fire" on Earth [06:19:01]. After these seven years, Jesus will return with the church [06:19:12]. The construction of the Third Temple is seen as a sign for Jesus's second coming, not the rapture [06:31:56]. All events preceding the rapture have already been fulfilled, meaning Jesus could return at any moment [06:31:47].

The message concludes with a call to repentance, belief in God and Jesus Christ, and to establish a living relationship with the Creator to find inner peace and abundant life, independent of worldly crises [06:21:20]. A prayer is offered for those seeking to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior [06:24:22].

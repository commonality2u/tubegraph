São Paulo, despite being considered the "locomotive of Brazil," faces significant challenges in its public services, particularly in [[law_enforcement_and_public_safety | public security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:31">[02:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:37">[02:27:37]</a>. The state experiences high levels of insecurity, with residents feeling unable to go out with cell phones on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>.

## Challenges in Police Force and Public Safety

São Paulo's police force suffers from a substantial deficit, estimated at nearly 15,000 personnel in the Civil Police alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>. This shortage impacts various aspects of policing:
*   **Understaffing** Many police officers are unable to work effectively due to a lack of new recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:26">[02:23:26]</a>.
*   **Low Salaries and Stagnant Careers** Police officers often face low salaries and a lack of career progression, making it difficult to retain personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:08">[02:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:10">[02:31:10]</a>. This issue can lead to officers leaving for federal police or other vocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:56">[02:30:56]</a>.
*   **Inaccessible Police Stations** Some police stations cannot open due to a lack of staff, and certain districts have an insufficient police presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:42">[02:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:43">[02:19:43]</a>.
*   **Deficit in Military Police** The Military Police also faces a deficit, with the effective number of officers decreasing while the population has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:25">[02:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:27">[02:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Strategies

To address these issues, a multi-faceted approach is necessary, focusing on both bolstering the police force and modernizing tactics:

### Strengthening the Police Force
*   **Reinforcing Staff** It is crucial to reinforce the police staff by opening more competitions and appointing approved candidates, such as the 126 fingerprint experts from the 2017 competition who are still waiting for nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:10">[02:30:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>.
*   **Improving Career Plans and Salaries** Modernizing career plans and improving salaries are essential to retain existing personnel and attract new talent, leveraging their vocational calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:36">[02:31:36]</a>.
*   **Medical Assistance and Subsidies** Implementing medical assistance and working with subsidies, similar to the Federal Police, can further enhance officer well-being and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:23">[02:31:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:24">[02:31:24]</a>.

### Modernizing Policing and Combating Crime
*   **Integrated Police and Road Monitoring** Integrating police forces and monitoring roads can increase effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:08">[02:21:08]</a>.
*   **Intelligence-Led Policing** Utilizing intelligence to identify high-risk areas and implement georeferenced crime tracking is fundamental to increasing the perception of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:13">[02:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>.
*   **Combating Organized Crime** Working with the federal government on intelligence and financial asphyxiation of organized crime is crucial, as even seemingly minor offenses like cell phone theft can be linked to larger criminal schemes with debt and distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:34">[02:21:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:36">[02:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:39">[02:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:41">[02:21:41]</a>.
*   **Addressing Criminals at Large** São Paulo has approximately 340,000 criminals at large with final and binding sentences, due to progression regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:56">[02:32:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:58">[02:32:58]</a>.
    *   The state governor, with the largest federal bench, can lead efforts in the national congress to toughen criminal legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:06">[02:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:10">[02:33:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>.
    *   Strict criminal monitoring is vital to ensure that special regimes and easements are fulfilled, combating recidivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:38">[02:34:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:41">[02:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:46">[02:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:53">[02:34:53]</a>.

### Prison Management
*   **No Universal Camera Policy for Prison Officers** While some propose installing cameras on all prison officers to prevent the entry of drugs and cell phones, the speaker believes this policy inhibits officers and constrains their capacity to act in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:55">[02:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:57">[02:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:18">[02:32:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:21">[02:32:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:26">[02:32:26]</a>. Instead, he advocates for trusting the prison police and focusing on overall security improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:07">[02:32:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:09">[02:32:09]</a>.
*   **Prison Officer Deficit** São Paulo also faces a deficit of prison officers, including military and civil police officers in the penitentiary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:24">[02:20:24]</a>.

São Paulo's ability to recover and improve its [[economic_and_social_issues_in_brazil | economic and social issues in Brazil]] hinges on its capacity to address these [[challenges_in_brazilian_politics | public security]] deficits through strategic investment, modern policies, and effective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>.

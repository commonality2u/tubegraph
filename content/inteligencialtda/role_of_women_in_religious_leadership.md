The role of women in religious leadership is a topic of ongoing discussion and interpretation within Christian theology. The speaker believes that [[role_of_men_and_women_in_family_according_to_the_bible | machismo is a consequence of the Fall]] of man, not God's original intent [02:44:23]. God never intended for women to be subjugated by men [02:45:10].

## Biblical Interpretation and Cultural Context
Christianity, as presented by Jesus, offers a redemptive view of women, treating them as equals to men [02:46:31]. In Jesus's time, the testimony of a woman was valued at half that of a man, requiring two women's testimonies to equal one man's [02:46:07]. However, Jesus chose to first appear to [[mary_magdalenes_historical_role | Mary Magdalene]] after his resurrection, instructing her to tell others, despite her perceived lack of credibility in society [02:46:14].

The Bible's approach to social issues like women's roles or slavery often blends with the prevailing culture, gradually transforming it over time [02:48:13]. For example, God did not immediately ban polygamy, which was practiced by figures like David and Solomon, but by Jesus's time, the norm had shifted back to one man and one woman [02:48:21]. Similarly, while the Bible does not explicitly command slave owners to free their slaves, the principle of freedom inherent in the Gospel is understood to be against slavery [02:48:46].

## Women as Pastors
Regarding women serving as pastors, the speaker believes that God allows women to be pastors because God is the one who bestows spiritual gifts [02:49:40].

Biblical passages, such as those from Paul, that seem to prohibit women from teaching are often interpreted within their cultural context [02:47:08]. In that era, women often lacked access to education and could not read or write. Instructions for women to ask questions at home, rather than in church, also reflect the cultural separation of men and women in worship settings, where they were typically divided into separate sections [02:47:26].

If God can appoint a woman to lead an entire nation, such as Deborah who was a judge and led war, it is illogical to assume a woman cannot be a pastor [02:51:11]. The issue of women in leadership within the church is largely a cultural one, with God giving gifts and anointing talents regardless of gender [02:51:28].

## Machismo and Feminism
Machismo is considered a consequence of the Fall, with the biblical curses on humanity following Adam and Eve's sin contributing to this societal imbalance [02:44:26]. Historically, women have often occupied an inferior position in society [02:45:18].

While the church is not solely responsible for machismo, it can reflect the prevailing societal sexism [02:46:36]. Feminism has brought significant advances, such as women's rights to education and voting, and continues to advocate for equality in areas like equal pay [02:51:51]. True equality between men and women is found within Christianity [02:52:18].

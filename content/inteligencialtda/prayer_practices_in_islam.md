Islamic prayer, known as Salah, is a fundamental aspect of the faith, characterized by specific rituals and intentions. It is a direct connection with God, guided by principles of conviction and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:15">[03:32:15]</a>.

## Daily Prayers

Muslims observe five daily prayers at set times throughout the day and night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. These prayers are considered primordial and immutable laws within Islamic legislation (Sharia), with no room for manipulation regarding their number or obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The first prayer can be as early as 5 or 6 in the morning, sometimes even 4:30 AM in summer, requiring significant effort to leave the comfort of one's bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### Rituals and Movements

Before prayer, Muslims perform ablution (washing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. Each prayer consists of a series of ritualistic movements and recitations:
*   **Standing (Qiyam)**: Facing the Kaaba in Mecca, symbolizing unity and detaching oneself from worldly distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:15">[03:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:29">[03:16:29]</a>. The right hand is placed over the left as a sign of peace and surrender to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:13">[03:17:13]</a>.
*   **Bowing (Ruku)**: A posture of reverence to God, where one praises God and recognizes His superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>.
*   **Prostration (Sujud)**: The forehead, nose, and palms of the hands are placed on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:40">[03:18:40]</a>. This act symbolizes humility, placing the highest part of the human body (the head, associated with pride and ego) on the lowest level, recognizing God's ultimate authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:29">[03:19:29]</a>. It is during prostration that one is closest and most humble to God, and can supplicate in any language, asking for anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:05">[03:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:14">[03:20:14]</a>.

These physical actions are not just movements; they are "exercises" or "training" to cultivate humility, simplicity, and self-control over ego and vanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>.

### Language and Content

The Quran is recited in Arabic during prayers to maintain its originality, as translations are considered interpretations that might not perfectly convey God's intended meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Even if a Muslim does not speak Arabic, they are expected to memorize parts of the Quran for prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.

A common supplication (Dua) from the Quran recited in prayer, known as Surah Al-Fatiha, includes: "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, all thanks, all praise is directed to the Lord of the Worlds, the Clement, the Merciful, we worship you and we beg you for protection and help, guide us to the straight path, the path of those whom Lord you blessed, not the lost, one of the abominable, nor of the lost, Lord of the day of final judgment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:15">[03:44:15]</a>.

## Spiritual Tools

### Prayer Beads (Tasbih)
Muslims use prayer beads, known as Tasbih, which typically have 33 beads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:39">[02:36:39]</a>. After each of the five daily prayers, these beads are used to:
*   Praise God 33 times
*   Thank God 33 times
*   Exalt God 33 times
This practice helps believers stay focused and spiritually elevated, even surpassing the good deeds of the wealthy who can give charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:29">[02:37:29]</a>. The Tasbih also serves as a "great therapy" to calm the mind and redirect thoughts from problems to gratitude, even in traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

### Invoking God's Name
Muslims invoke God's name (`Bismillah`, "In the name of God") before performing various actions, such as drinking, getting dressed, or leaving the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This practice invokes God's blessing and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Greetings
The Islamic greeting "Salamaleico" means "peace of God be with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The response is "Aleikum Salam" (and with you too, the peace of God) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This greeting is a form of prayer and a wish for peace upon others, promoting reciprocity and a blessed start to interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Fasting
[[concept_of_fasting_in_spirituality_and_its_benefits | Fasting]] during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, involves abstaining from food and liquid from dawn until sunset for the entire month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. This practice serves multiple functions:
*   **Social**: Feeling hunger directly helps one empathize with and better assist those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Elevation**: A period of increased devotion and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.
*   **Mental and Self-Control**: Strengthens discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:36">[01:47:36]</a>.
*   **Physical Detox**: Cleanses the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:39">[01:47:39]</a>.

Ramadan's timing shifts annually because the Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, which is approximately 10 days shorter than the solar calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>.

## Connection to [[role_of_islam_in_daily_life | Islamic Life]]

In Islam, there is no separation between the secular and the spiritual; all aspects of life are governed by religious values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. This means prayer and religious principles guide behavior in all rolesâ€”as a husband, wife, politician, citizen, or worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>. The word "Muslim" itself means one who "surrenders totally and voluntarily to God, the only one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>, signifying a complete adherence to God's will. The first revealed verse of the Quran emphasizes the acquisition of knowledge as the initial step towards God and faith, underscoring that conviction in [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_faith_practice | faith practice]] comes from knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:21">[03:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:29">[03:22:29]</a>.

## Intercession and Healing

Muslims believe in [[intercession_of_saints_and_the_role_of_prayer | the power of prayer]] for healing. The practice includes reading verses of the Quran over water, which is then consumed by a sick person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The initial and most crucial step for healing, however, is the individual's belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Words are seen as vibrations and energy, and positive words, especially those from the heart, create good impressions and positive memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

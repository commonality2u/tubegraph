The role of Jesus in the Old Testament is primarily understood through his pre-existence as God, his involvement in creation, and prophetic foreshadowing that points to his eventual incarnation and saving work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:04">[26:55:04]</a>.

## Pre-existent God and Creator

In [[biblical_interpretation_of_jesus_and_the_trinity | Christian theology]], Jesus is considered eternal God, never created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:15">[08:42:15]</a>. He is the "Word" (Logos), described in the first chapter of John as being with God and being God from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:07">[08:48:07]</a>. This "Word" is the very essence and action of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

The Bible states that all things were made through Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:27">[09:09:27]</a>, and without him, nothing was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:44">[09:14:44]</a>. In the narrative of creation, God the Father is presented as the architect, creating through the Word (Jesus), with the Holy Spirit supervising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:10">[09:17:10]</a>. The plural term "Elohim" (Gods) in Genesis 1:1, alongside the statement "Let us make man in our image and likeness," implies the active participation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

## The "Angel of the Lord"

In the Old Testament, Jesus often appears as a messenger of Yahweh, referred to as the "angel of the Lord" (malar Yahu in the original Hebrew) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:37">[11:07:37]</a>. This figure is distinct from created angels, as he receives adoration, which created angels refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:03">[11:51:03]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Moses at the Burning Bush**: The voice from the bush, identified as the Lord Jesus, commands Moses to remove his sandals because the place is holy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
*   **Joshua before Jericho**: Joshua encounters a figure with a drawn sword, who identifies himself as the "captain of the armies of the Most High" and also commands Joshua to remove his sandals, indicating a holy presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Abraham's encounter**: Three beings appear to Abraham at noon, two of whom are angels, and the third is identified as the "angel of the Lord" (Jesus), who receives worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>.

## Prophetic Foreshadowing and Types

The entire Old Testament speaks of Christ, with thousands of prophecies, types, characters, and objects pointing to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:04">[26:55:04]</a>. Jesus himself stated that the Scriptures testify of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

### From Creation to the Messiah
The first prophecy about the Messiah is found in Genesis 3:15, where God declares enmity between the serpent and the woman, stating that the woman's descendant will bruise the serpent's head, while the serpent will bite his heel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. This foretells Christ's ultimate victory over the devil through his death and resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. This promise was passed down through generations, making people anticipate a redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>.

### The Sacrifice of Isaac
The story of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac is considered a "type" of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. Isaac is seen as a representation of Christ, and God's intervention to provide a ram for the sacrifice (Jehovah Jireh - "The Lord will provide") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a> foreshadows God providing Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>.

### The Paschal Lamb
Jesus' death on Easter (Passover) day was not arbitrary; it fulfilled his role as the Paschal Lamb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. The Passover ritual, where a perfect, one-year-old lamb was examined for four days before being sacrificed, directly parallels Jesus' examination by authorities in Jerusalem from the 10th to the 14th day of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. The timing of his crucifixion and death also aligns with the morning and afternoon sacrifices in the temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

### Prophecies of Birth and Incarnation
*   **Bethlehem**: The prophet Micah (Micah 5:2) prophesied that the ruler of Israel would come from Bethlehem Ephrathah, a small city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:58:00">[37:58:00]</a>. Caesar Augustus' census decree required Joseph and Mary to travel to Bethlehem, ensuring Jesus' birth there, fulfilling the prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.
*   **Eternal Father and Son**: Isaiah foretold a child born, a son given, whose name would be "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:38">[01:42:38]</a>. This text highlights Jesus' dual nature as both a born child and the eternal God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Virgin Birth**: Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that a virgin would conceive and bear a son, named Immanuel (God with us) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a>. This was essential for Jesus to be sinless, as sin is transmitted through the human father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:17">[02:06:17]</a>. Adam, not Eve, transmitted sin because the command not to eat the fruit was given to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>.
*   **Light of the World**: Isaiah also prophesied that the world walking in darkness would see a great light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>, referring to Jesus, who identified himself as the light of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

## Purpose of the First Coming
Jesus' incarnation and first coming were part of God's eternal "Plan A," not merely a reaction to humanity's fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. God, being omniscient, knew humanity would fall and pre-ordained Christ as the Redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. Jesus came to live among humanity, endure difficulties, remain sinless, and die innocently for sinners, demonstrating God's incomprehensible and unconditional love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. His purpose was to save humanity from sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a> and to bring about a radical change in Western culture through his teachings, which were millennia ahead of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. His death was necessary because without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>. While the blood of animals in the Old Testament provided a temporary "covering" (kippur) for sins, Jesus' blood destroys sins and provides permanent forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>, making further sacrifice unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

Pastor Antônio Júnior's [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | spiritual journey]] began with a childhood influenced by diverse religious practices, leading to a profound [[spiritual experiences and manifestations | encounter with God]] and a dedicated path in ministry.

## Early Life and Religious Background
Born in São Sebastião do Paraíso, Minas Gerais, Antônio Júnior grew up in the countryside near Ribeirão Preto [00:05:16]. His family was Catholic, but they also frequented a Spiritist Center, leading to a mixed religious upbringing [00:07:41]. He noted that many people practiced both Catholicism and Spiritism, finding comfort and believing in the spiritual side, which he observed also features in the Bible [00:07:56].

He described his childhood as wonderful and very healthy, spending time playing in the street and football with neighbors [00:07:29].

## First Encounter with God
Around the age of 10 or 12, Antônio Júnior had his first significant [[spiritual experiences and manifestations | experience with God]]. While on a mountain near his city with his uncle and brother, he spontaneously thought of God while observing nature. He felt a great peace but kept this experience to himself [00:08:46].

Later, while in Rio de Janeiro visiting his uncle, he couldn't sleep one night and again thought of God. He prayed, "God, if you exist, one day I want to meet you," and felt a great peace, which he knew came from God [00:09:32].

## Adolescence: Struggles and Search for Meaning
During his adolescence, Antônio Júnior continued to search for something to fill an internal emptiness [00:11:13]. He indulged in "things of the world," including heavy drinking and drug use, despite his parents not teaching him these behaviors [00:10:28].

He was also deeply interested in rock music and esotericism from around 15 years old, listening to various music genres and exploring esoteric concepts [00:11:23]. He joined a punk-rock band, imagining a future of success and wealth [00:12:04]. His appearance reflected this, with eight earrings, black nail polish, red hair, and ripped clothes, which worried his parents [00:12:47].

At 16, a critical point arrived when he felt things no longer fit together [00:13:37]. He used online chat rooms and eventually met a girl from his hometown whom he began dating. Her family practiced Candomblé, which caused some concern for his Catholic/Spiritist family, especially as he was seen as "extreme" and unbalanced [00:14:36].

### Encounter with Spiritism and Spiritual Warfare
He started attending the Candomblé center with his girlfriend. He described the place as a large, dark hall with many images of saints and caboclos [00:15:20]. During a session, he witnessed people "squirming" and changing their shape, which frightened him [00:17:04]. He also heard "goat-like laughter" and observed young people drinking cachaça and speaking in altered voices, attributing it to entities [00:17:27].

He was consulted by an entity that spoke through a person, giving him advice and even telling him to remove his earrings, stating that his father wouldn't like them and that he and his girlfriend made a beautiful couple [00:18:24]. The entity gave him its name, which he kept secret for two to three years [00:19:19].

Antônio Júnior's subsequent week was "the worst of my life" [00:20:32]. He experienced constant thoughts of death and even wrote a farewell letter to his family [00:20:40]. Feeling desperate, he considered calling on the entity for help, but an inner voice, which he now attributes to the Holy Spirit, told him not to, as "it is not from God" [00:21:30].

## The Turning Point: Conversion to Christ
Around this time, his paternal grandmother, a fervent Catholic who had experienced a significant health improvement through prayer from the Church of Grace, converted [00:22:28]. She visited his room, which was filled with esoteric items like gnomes and witches, burning incense [00:22:48]. She asked to pray for him, and despite his indifference, he allowed it [02:23:54]. He believes her prayers, unbeknownst to him, were already influencing him [02:23:46].

Shortly after, his girlfriend called him, crying, and broke up with him, citing a headache and a feeling that their relationship wouldn't work [02:42:07]. This breakup was influenced by her consultation with the entity at the Candomblé center [02:14:16].

Leaving her house, alone on a dark street, he remembered his childhood prayer asking God for a girlfriend [02:42:07]. He then prayed the Lord's Prayer, the only prayer he knew [02:26:50]. For the first time, he heard the voice of God clearly, saying, "My son, you are very valuable to me, and you will still see the great work that I will do in your life" [02:27:01]. He cried uncontrollably, a significant emotional release for someone not accustomed to crying [02:27:17]. He knew it was God speaking [02:27:46].

The next day at school, when he shared his [[spiritual experiences and manifestations | experience]], his friends laughed, saying he was the "messiest one" and that God doesn't speak to people like that [02:28:00]. The "enemy" constantly tried to make him doubt the experience [02:28:20].

## Deepening Faith and Ministerial Calling
At 18, Antônio Júnior's cousin, who had radically converted to Christ, visited him [03:16:00]. His cousin was reading the Bible and listening to gospel music, which seemed strange to Antônio Júnior [03:20:00]. The cousin shared how Jesus had changed his life, initially dismissed by Antônio Júnior [03:28:00]. However, seeing his cousin's radical transformation, Antônio Júnior became curious [03:31:00].

He returned to his city and struggled to live a Christian life by his own strength, realizing he needed the Holy Spirit [03:45:00]. Through divine intervention, he repeatedly found himself in his cousin's city, where his cousin continued to speak about God [03:47:00]. During one visit, his cousin, seeing Antônio Júnior's persistent confusion, declared he would no longer bring up the topic of God unless Antônio Júnior initiated it [03:59:00].

Coincidentally, his cousin then had to visit Antônio Júnior's city. They spent a day together, with Antônio Júnior observing his cousin's new life, including a visit to a Christian store [03:59:00]. That night, sitting at a bar, Antônio Júnior drank beer while his cousin ordered coke, but they talked for hours. Antônio Júnior felt a great peace talking to him and asked many questions about the Bible [03:43:00]. His cousin, gifted in teaching, explained various doctrines [03:57:00]. As the bar closed, Antônio Júnior asked to stay at his cousin's house to continue the conversation, leading to an all-night discussion. His cousin then told him, "Juninho, you need to repent, man, you need to change your life, give your life to Jesus, otherwise, you're not saved" [03:06:00].

This triggered a fear of death in Antônio Júnior, believing something bad or very good was about to happen [03:31:00]. His life felt "like a grimace" [03:47:00]. He continued to struggle with old habits, feeling physically ill after a party where he drank and smoked excessively [03:47:00]. A battle raged within him between good and evil, and his friends didn't understand [03:15:00]. His cousin advised him to focus on the Bible rather than seeking a church immediately [03:21:00].

Driven by curiosity, he eventually decided to visit an evangelical church [03:50:00]. He contacted a pastor and arranged to attend a Sunday service. Upon arriving, he was initially scared by the loud prayers but couldn't shake off the experience throughout the week [03:57:00]. He eventually returned with friends, including one named Bruno Ottoni who later married a girl he met there [03:53:00]. Antônio Júnior went with the mindset of observing "what they are like" [03:09:00].

At the church, a sister named Fatima recognized him from his father's store, where she had seen him with painted nails and torn clothes, and told him she had prayed for him [04:06:00]. He was wearing a Sepultura t-shirt, not expecting to convert [04:22:00]. He enjoyed the messages and praise but kept his attendance secret [04:28:00].

He experienced frustration when he found that some church youth were not as devout as he expected, leading him to seek out firmer believers [04:55:00]. He accepted an invitation to a prayer vigil [04:57:00]. Despite many temptations, he resolved to go, wanting to understand the evangelical religion without prejudice [04:49:00].

### The Vigil and Spiritual Baptism
At the vigil, he felt like "a fish out of water" in the unfamiliar culture [04:08:00]. He witnessed a woman speaking in tongues and another laughing uncontrollably, which he later learned was a "revival" of the Holy Spirit widespread in Brazil in 2002 [04:11:00]. During the vigil, his friends started mocking a woman for her off-key singing, but he saw it as God revealing things about people [04:51:00].

Suddenly, he declared to his friends, "God is going to talk to me now" [04:56:00]. His friends, surprised, left him alone [04:02:00]. Left alone, he questioned his own declaration [04:10:00]. Then, his body began to shake, he felt hot, and thought he was dying. He resisted kneeling but eventually did, feeling peace and crying [04:23:00]. A deacon named Pedrinho opened the Bible and read the passage about Jesus calming the storm [04:57:00]. The deacon then described Antônio Júnior's life, saying it was "totally troubled" and "like the disciples' boat" [04:34:00]. This revelation confirmed to Antônio Júnior that the deacon knew about his life without being told [04:56:00].

He was urged to give his life to Jesus, and as he prayed, a "movie of his life" played in his mind, filled with regret for past sins [04:18:00]. He surrendered to Jesus, feeling an incredible peace, and cried like a baby [04:47:00]. He hugged people and declared, "God just spoke to me!" [04:56:00]. He felt like he was "in heaven" [04:07:00].

### Supernatural Experiences and Confirmation of Call
Leaving the vigil, Antônio Júnior had his first physical [[spiritual experiences and manifestations | contact with the supernatural]]. He saw a "wizard-like" figure crouched in the woods, visible only to him [04:51:00]. His friend's daughter told him to "cast out in the name of Jesus," which he did, and the figure vanished [04:58:00]. He realized it was the devil, acknowledging God's work in his life [04:53:00].

He slept soundly that night, unlike ever before, and the next day called his cousin to share his experience, declaring he was going to church [04:11:00]. From then on, he couldn't hide his faith, as Jesus said, "You are the light of the world, cannot be hidden" [04:36:00]. His father often found him praying by his bed [04:47:00]. The city talked about his conversion, and even his art teacher lamented his chosen path [04:57:00]. His school friends dismissed it as a "fire of straw," thinking it wouldn't last [04:57:00].

He questioned God why only he seemed to have this profound experience [04:00:00]. His sister initially thought his cousin had brainwashed him, and his family worried he would become the "black sheep" [04:57:00]. He even went to church quietly at 6 AM before school [04:11:00].

Antônio Júnior began seeking God's specific plan for his life [04:40:00]. During a vigil, a girl named Ana Claudia prayed for him, prophesying that he would have a ministry reaching people across Brazil and beyond, despite his shyness and past as a rock band singer who looked at the floor [04:03:00]. He kept this in his heart, not understanding how it would happen [04:27:00].

Later, at a "Toque no Altar" concert in Ribeirão Preto, a worship leader spoke to him, confirming that God would use him mightily [04:50:00]. He felt unworthy but also recognized God's thirst for those who sought Him deeply [04:54:00].

He also desired to experience heaven. One night, he chose to sleep on the floor like Jesus, and woke up in a "totally dark" place, feeling an intense peace and the presence of God [05:04:00]. He felt unworthy and asked God to take him away, then woke up [05:14:00]. Later, he heard a pastor describe a similar experience of passing through a dark environment before reaching the "portal" of heaven, making sense of his own vision [05:57:00].

He tried to minister praise in church but felt inadequate [05:16:00]. However, people confirmed God's use of him [05:32:00]. He also started dreaming of himself preaching [05:52:00].

## The Gift of Tongues and Further Dedication
Around 2004, two years after his conversion, he desired to pray in tongues, seeing it as a powerful connection to God [05:07:00]. He sought this gift with a friend, praying nightly and undertaking a three-day fast, which was the hardest thing he had ever done while working [05:32:00]. Despite feeling nothing immediately, two days later, during a prayer session in a truck, the Holy Spirit filled him, and he began praying in tongues, experiencing incredible peace and joy [05:47:00].

This experience enabled him to access "more things" of God [02:22:00]. He believes the gift of tongues is for personal edification, while prophecy is for the whole church [02:22:00].

## Challenges and Confirmation of Ministry
The year following his profound spiritual experiences was the most difficult, as the enemy intensified his attacks [01:05:48]. Antônio Júnior struggled to focus on college and work, constantly questioning God's plan [01:05:50]. He failed 8 subjects in his advertising and propaganda college [01:07:00].

He confessed his calling to his parents, initially fearing their reaction [01:07:47]. However, his parents were amazed, and his father strongly supported him, offering to pay for him to attend a seminary anywhere in the world, telling him to forget college and focus on God's call [01:08:21].

He attended a seminary in Belo Horizonte but still felt unsure of where to start his ministry [01:09:05]. A relationship he had there ended, leaving him frustrated and feeling lost [01:09:38]. During a carnival camp in Rio Claro, God renewed him, and during a vigil, he received a clear message: "My son, it was I who brought you from that city because I have a work for you here, and from today I begin to restore each area of your life" [01:10:06]. This brought immense comfort in his "desert" period [01:10:06].

At this camp, he met his future wife, Taís [01:10:47]. He pursued her, and though she was initially hesitant, his persistence and a friend's intervention eventually led her to open her heart [01:11:00].

He was invited to preach at her grandmother's simple, Pentecostal church [01:12:10]. As he began to share his [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | testimony]], the pastor of the church, without knowing him, approached him and placed a ring on his hand, prophesying that God had shown him who Antônio Júnior was before his conversion and that he would marry Taís at their altar [01:12:34]. This profound experience filled him with joy and confirmation [01:13:12]. Later, the pastor also revealed to Taís's grandmother that Antônio Júnior would marry her granddaughter [01:13:33].

He stresses that God's plan is good, perfect, and pleasant, but humans have free will to choose whether to follow it [01:46:30]. He emphasizes that he serves because God enabled him, not by his own strength [02:18:01].

## [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | Spiritual Warfare]] and the Role of Grace
Antônio Júnior describes [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual warfare]] as a constant battle against the enemy [01:28:12]. He explains that Satan, a former angel, has access to God's presence and wanders the earth, observing humans [01:30:13]. He believes demons are organized and capable of imitation, but cannot replicate the peace and holiness that come from God [01:31:52].

He differentiates between a "born again" Christian who cannot be demon-possessed (as the Holy Spirit controls their spirit), and someone who is "demoniac" (possessed by a demon in their soul/mind) [01:52:00]. He states that oppression, discouragement, and vices can be a result of giving the enemy "openings" through unforgiveness or unconfessed sins [01:54:19].

He emphasizes the concept of grace over law, explaining that the law reveals sin but does not give the strength to overcome it [02:00:54]. Grace, through Jesus' perfect sacrifice, provides forgiveness and enables believers to live a holy life through the Holy Spirit [02:11:14]. He argues against legalism and rule-based living, which he believes frustrates believers and keeps them from experiencing God's full blessings [02:40:00].

Antônio Júnior has participated in [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcisms]], describing powerful manifestations of demons and the need for authority in the name of Jesus, often requiring persistence and the collective prayer of multiple individuals [03:03:00]. He recounts an experience where a demon, identifying itself as a "legion," mocked and accused him, highlighting the enemy's deceptive tactics [03:06:00]. He underscores that the name of Jesus is sufficient, but faith and a consecrated life are crucial for effective deliverance [03:07:00]. He acknowledges the existence of a spiritual hierarchy among demons, requiring specific approaches like prayer and fasting [03:08:00].

He also touches on familiar spirits, which he believes are demons that accompany families and perpetuate cycles of sin and vice [02:56:06]. He warns against engaging with occult practices like Ouija boards, as they open doors to demonic influence [03:17:00].

## Reflections on Gifts, Prophecy, and Free Will
Antônio Júnior believes in the continuation of spiritual gifts, including tongues, prophecy, and words of knowledge and wisdom, for the edification of the church [01:15:00]. He defines the gift of prophesying as the preaching of God's word, while words of knowledge relate to past events and words of wisdom to future ones [02:37:00].

On the topic of free will, he believes that Adam and Eve had complete free will before the fall, but after the fall, humanity's will became enslaved to sin [02:44:00]. While God desires all to be saved, salvation is ultimately by God's choice and grace, not human effort, though humans must choose to follow God's guidance [02:45:00]. He emphasizes that God's kindness leads to repentance, not fear of punishment [02:25:02].

## Conclusion
Pastor Antônio Júnior's journey is a testament to his profound [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | spiritual transformation]] from a troubled youth engaged in worldly and occult practices to a dedicated minister. His experiences, from initial divine encounters to challenging [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual battles]] and clear confirmations of his calling, have shaped his emphasis on God's grace, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the reality of [[spiritual teachings and beliefs | spiritual warfare]]. He continues to serve, driven by a deep conviction that God works powerfully in the lives of those who surrender to Him.

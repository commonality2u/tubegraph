## Early Life and Childhood Experiences
[[Danilo Gentilis personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo Gentili's]] comedic trajectory is deeply rooted in his personal experiences, including early financial struggles and family tragedies. He recounted a period in his life when he had "no money to pay rent" and felt there was "no prescriptive" future [02:29:17].

Several significant events marked his youth:
*   His father passed away suddenly when [[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo]] was 17 or 18 years old [01:18:22], [02:27:24].
*   Less than six months later, his sister died in a car accident on her first day of work [02:27:33].
*   Within a week of his sister's death, his car was stolen during a nationwide blackout that also caused all electronics in his house to burn [02:27:42], [02:28:42].
*   A few months later, his mother had an accident and lost a finger while collecting a car donation for an orphanage where she worked [02:28:50].

Despite these hardships, [[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo]] maintained a belief in gratitude, stating that he "never doubted" God and "at all times gave thanks" based on a biblical verse about giving thanks in everything [02:29:33]. He actively sought out the positive aspects of his life to be thankful for, which he believes improved his circumstances [02:30:00].

## Entry into Entertainment and Stand-up Comedy
[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] initially entered the entertainment world with a provisional contract for the program *CQC*, where he was initially seen as just "filling sausage" [02:46:00], [03:13:00]. Despite feeling uncomfortable at first, he turned this discomfort into a comedic gag [03:57:00]. He even created many physical gags for the show [04:31:00].

His early experiences included being expelled from the House of Councilors in São Paulo during his first "inexperienced reporter" segment with Agnaldo Timóteo [04:56:00], and later from Congress in Brasília for asking a PT leader about corruption in 2008, a question no one else dared to ask [05:09:00], [06:21:00]. He found this incident revealing about how the PT was "spoiled by the press" [06:30:00].

[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] discovered stand-up comedy through the internet, which opened up a world of research for him. He remembered seeing an "elegant" Jerry Lewis on stage, telling stories in a suit and tie at a club, and thought it was "really cool," even though he didn't know it was called stand-up at the time [02:27:29], [02:41:10]. He initially thought it was "f***ing awesome but there's no such thing in Brazil" [02:57:00].

He joined an Orkut community created by Henrique Pantarotto dedicated to stand-up comedy, where he began exchanging ideas [03:48:00], [03:50:00]. He was invited by Marcela Leal to perform after she read his text, and he debuted at a venue called "Click" [03:16:00], [03:40:00], [03:7:00]. He stated his first performance was "making a full entry" with three small jokes and a segment about Silvio Santos's "Roda a Roda" [03:48:00]. He initially felt it went "very well" [03:03:00].

## Influences and Approach to Comedy
[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili's]] comedic style is deeply influenced by honesty and a willingness to tackle controversial topics. He states he doesn't "know how to lie" [02:50:00].

He discussed the challenge of political humor, noting that while he made jokes about various politicians, including Serra, Aécio, and Collor, the ones targeting Lula and Dilma began to attract negative attention, leading to accusations of sexism and efforts to "decontextualize" his work [01:46:49], [01:47:18]. He believes this scrutiny began after his "politically incorrect" show in Brasília in 2010, which was broadcast live online and featured heavy political jokes [01:44:53].

He also delved into the "cancel culture" phenomenon, drawing parallels between his experiences and those of Wilson Simonal, whom he called Brazil's "first cancelled" person, even without the internet [01:16:00]. He noted that what was done to Simonal was "done to me every month" but that he's lucky to have the internet to "talk fire against fire" [01:17:00].

## Relationships with Other Comedians
[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] maintained generally positive relationships with his peers in the early stand-up scene. He expressed gratitude towards Marcela Leal for giving him an opportunity to perform [01:13:04], and to Robson Nunes and Luiz França for their generosity [01:13:26]. He also highlighted the support of [[Diogo Portugal's standup and comedy career | Diogo Portugal]], who "never stopped now until today to do desire" and was always supportive and a "good guy" [01:54:00]. [[Diogo Portugal's standup and comedy career | Diogo Portugal]] was the first person to call [[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo]] for a show in Curitiba [01:12:09] and offered early encouragement [01:12:20].

He recalled an incident with Rafinha Bastos, who was initially against the Comedy Club moving to a theater, but then started doing theater himself within a week or two [05:40:00]. [[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo]] also described an argument between Rafinha and Oscar Filho regarding Oscar's absence from a show to attend a friend's wake, with Rafinha being "very rude" [05:54:00].

Despite some conflicts, [[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] emphasized the importance of mutual support among comedians for the scene to grow [01:00:16]. He recalled forming his own group, "Live Comedy," because Rafinha wouldn't let him join the Comedy Club, believing he needed his "own night to grow" [01:01:40]. He even helped write texts for fellow comedians like Pepperoni [01:05:27].

## Political and Social Commentary in Comedy
[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] is known for his sharp political and social commentary. He criticizes the double standards he perceives in media and politics, particularly regarding accusations of sexism and "fake news."

He recounted an incident where a joke he made about a Brazilian woman seeking to enter the Guinness Book as the biggest milk donor was misconstrued by the press and political figures [02:11:43]. He used a common comedy structure involving a "setup" (the news about the milk donor) and a "punchline" (referencing Kid Bengala, an adult film actor known for his large penis), which he stated was a "comic distortion" and "exaggeration" [02:12:51], [02:13:10], [02:13:19]. Despite the joke not calling the woman a "cow," news outlets affiliated with the PT reported that he did, leading to public outcry and a lawsuit, which he ultimately lost [02:14:36], [02:15:24], [02:20:44].

[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Gentili]] views these attacks as part of a larger pattern of "narratives" created to condemn him, portraying him as an "oppressor" who targeted a "poor Northeastern woman feeding children" [02:19:50]. He asserts that these groups, whom he refers to as "progressives," use their platforms to attack him in newsrooms, while "bolsominions" (supporters of Bolsonaro) attack on Twitter [02:22:07]. He also noted that many comedians who were silent during the previous government's "blacklist" became vocal critics of the current government, which he finds "ugly" [02:22:51].

## Personal Philosophy
[[Danilo Gentili's personal stories and influences in comedy | Danilo]] strives for honesty in his work and personal life, aiming to "do everything honestly" [03:00:00]. He stated that he is "not afraid of losing" his job because he is primarily grateful to God and to the "nice people he put in my way" [02:33:10], [02:33:21]. When confronted with disloyalty, his approach is to remove people from his life for "practicality" rather than seeking "revenge" [02:34:20]. He believes that he is "nothing" without God, and that being aware of having "little" can give one "a lot" [02:34:41].

[[neuroscience_and_brain_research | Neuroscience]] is the study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and all their constituent neurons and neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This field aims to understand how the brain enables human behavior, cognition, and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Brain: Structure and Function

The human brain is a highly complex organ responsible for controlling thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger, and every process that regulates the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:57">[02:07:57]</a>.

### Neurons and Brain Size
The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, which are the functional cells of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>. While the elephant brain has more neurons overall (over 200 billion), the human brain possesses a more sophisticated cortex, with a relatively higher concentration of neurons in this outer region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>.

### Cortex and Prefrontal Cortex
The cerebral cortex, often referred to as the "bark" of the brain, is the outermost layer of the cerebrum, playing a key role in memory, attention, perception, cognition, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:56">[02:07:56]</a>. The prefrontal cortex, located in the front part of the frontal lobe, is particularly crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>. This region is involved in complex behaviors like planning, decision-making, impulse control, empathy, and simulating future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. Its development continues into the early twenties, explaining why adolescents may exhibit impulsivity and less emotional control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

## [[role_of_brain_function_and_neuroimaging_in_understanding_behavior | Brain Function and Behavior]]

The brain and body are intrinsically linked; improvements in metabolic health lead to improvements in brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

### Impact of Physical Activity
Physical activity is indisputably beneficial for cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Engaging in physical activity, even a simple mile walk, can increase catecholamines like norepinephrine and [[dopamine_and_its_impact_on_motivation_and_pleasure | dopamine]], improving learning and overall cognitive function in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. Over the long term, physical activity helps form habits and increases neurotrophic factors, which facilitate brain changes and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

### Impact of Diet
Diet significantly impacts brain health. High-calorie diets, especially those high in concentrated fructose (like that found in soda), can negatively affect the central nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Studies show that even short periods of unhealthy eating, such as four days of high-calorie coffee, can impair memory storage in healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.

### Insulin and the Brain
Insulin, primarily known for its role in regulating blood sugar in peripheral metabolism, also has a significant role in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. While neurons do not require insulin to capture glucose, insulin in the brain is crucial for memory formation, focus, attention, and general cognitive improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. Insulin resistance, often seen in type 2 diabetes, can negatively impact both peripheral metabolism and brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

### Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals from a neuron across a synapse to a target cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

#### [[dopamine_and_its_impact_on_motivation_and_pleasure | Dopamine]]
Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter primarily associated with motivation, reward-seeking behavior, and the anticipation of pleasure, rather than pleasure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. For instance, dopamine levels rise when ordering a pizza, not necessarily when eating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:30:19]</a>. It functions in two main modes:
*   **Tonic dopamine** is a constant, baseline level that influences overall mood, activity, and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a>. Individuals with lower tonic dopamine may be less motivated or sadder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.
*   **Phasic dopamine** refers to rapid, transient bursts in response to specific stimuli, especially those associated with immediate rewards or anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>. Modern society, with its abundance of easily accessible high-dopamine stimuli (e.g., sugar, alcohol, pornography, social media), can lead to a "dopamine mismatch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>. Over-reliance on phasic dopamine can cause downregulation of dopamine receptors, making individuals resistant to dopamine and requiring more intense stimuli to feel motivated, potentially leading to [[neuroscience_of_addiction_and_behavior | addiction]] and difficulty experiencing pleasure from everyday activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.

#### Oxytocin
Often called the "love hormone," oxytocin is involved in social bonding, trust, and group perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. Its release strengthens relationships within a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, but can also contribute to xenophobia by reinforcing "us vs. them" mentalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>.

### The Default Mode Network
The default mode network (DMN) is a brain network that becomes active when individuals are not engaged in external tasks, such as during daydreaming, self-reflection, or mind-wandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">[01:47:55]</a>. In patients with depression, the DMN is often hyperactive, leading to excessive rumination and difficulty engaging with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:25">[01:48:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:30">[01:48:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. Behavioral activation, such as engaging in simple tasks, can deactivate the DMN and improve mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.

## [[neuroplasticity_and_learning_strategies | Neuroplasticity and Learning]]

[[neuroplasticity_and_learning_strategies | Neuroplasticity]] refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt its structure and function in response to experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>.

### Brain Adaptation
The brain physically molds itself according to an individual's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. For example, individuals with very good memories tend to have a larger hippocampus, the brain region associated with memory storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. A famous study on London taxi drivers demonstrated that those who successfully passed a rigorous test requiring knowledge of 25,000 streets showed an increase in the size of their hippocampus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This indicates that intensive learning can lead to structural changes in the brain, similar to how muscles hypertrophy with exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.

### Neurotrophic Factors
In the long term, physical activity increases the production of neurotrophic factors, which are proteins that support the growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. These factors are crucial for [[neuroplasticity_and_learning_strategies | neuroplasticity]] and overall brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

### Developmental Changes
The brain's ability to change and learn is particularly high during childhood, a period known as a "neuroplastic window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:43">[01:35:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. Young children often have more synaptic connections than adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. Around age 25, the brain becomes more "concrete," making it harder to learn new things or adapt to new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:45">[01:36:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:49">[01:36:49]</a>. Therefore, introducing new languages or complex skills early in life is more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.

## Brain Disorders and Conditions

### [[the_relationship_between_diet_brain_health_and_disorders_like_alzheimers | Alzheimer's Disease]]
[[the_relationship_between_diet_brain_health_and_disorders_like_alzheimers | Alzheimer's Disease]] is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the worst type of dementia, characterized by the accelerated death of neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>. It involves the buildup of amyloid plaques and beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>. Early symptoms often include mood problems like depression before significant memory loss occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.

While genetics play a role in a small percentage of cases, most Alzheimer's cases are influenced by lifestyle factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>. Risk factors include chronic stress, diabetes (especially type 2), and exposure to pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:05">[01:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>. There is currently no cure, but treatments can slow the progression of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a>. Physical exercise, by releasing the hormone irisina, can help prevent and treat Alzheimer's by preventing the toxicity of beta-amyloid peptides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.

### Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. It involves a decrease in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to difficulties with focus and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. Individuals with ADHD often struggle with time perception, overestimating the difficulty of tasks, which can lead to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Medications like Ritalin and Venvanse work by restoring dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. However, these medications can impair learning in individuals without ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.

### Depression
Chronic stress is a major risk factor for developing depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>. Depression is characterized by decreased dopamine levels, leading to anhedonia (the inability to seek or experience pleasure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>. In depressed patients, the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in conflict monitoring, is often hyperactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:49">[01:58:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Borderline Personality Disorder
Borderline personality disorder is a personality disorder often confused with bipolar disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:33">[02:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:40">[02:52:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a>. It is characterized by difficulties in impulse control and emotional regulation, often linked to impaired communication between the prefrontal cortex and limbic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:10">[02:53:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:17">[02:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a>. Patients often experience intense anger, a strong fear of abandonment, and difficulty coping with frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior, existing on a spectrum from mild to severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:28">[02:54:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. Individuals with ASD often have difficulty with "theory of mind," the ability to infer the mental states of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:19">[02:56:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:21">[02:56:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:46">[02:56:46]</a>. They may also exhibit altered brain activity in regions involved in interpreting biological movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:59">[02:56:59]</a>. Early intervention is crucial for improving prognosis due to the brain's [[neuroplasticity_and_learning_strategies | plasticity]] at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:04">[02:58:04]</a>.

### Stuttering
Stuttering is a speech disorder, but its exact causes are not fully understood by neuroscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:26">[02:59:26]</a>. It is unclear if it's solely emotional, involves problems in brain areas related to speech production, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_modern_lifestyle_on_brain_health | Modern Lifestyle and Brain Health]]

Modern society, characterized by rapid technological advancements and constant stimuli, presents a mismatch with the brain's evolutionary design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. The brain, evolved for slower-paced rewards and less information overload, struggles to adapt to the constant influx of high-dopamine stimuli from sources like social media, pornography, and easy access to food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

### Boredom and Constant Stimulation
The ease of obtaining instant gratification has led to an inability to tolerate boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. People constantly seek external stimuli to avoid quiet moments, whether through phones, social media, or other forms of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. This constant stimulation leads to desensitization, requiring increasingly intense experiences to feel satisfaction, and can cause a decline in baseline dopamine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.

### Social Media and Oxytocin
Social media platforms exacerbate this issue by creating "bubbles" where individuals are primarily exposed to content and opinions that align with their own, reinforcing existing beliefs and providing a constant stream of positive feedback that increases oxytocin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>. While fostering group cohesion, this can lead to intolerance for differing views and a reduced ability to cope with disagreement or disappointment in real-world interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:21">[01:32:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>.

### Sleep Hygiene
Poor sleep habits negatively impact brain function, leading to reduced emotional control, increased irritability, and cravings for unhealthy food and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:05">[02:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:11">[02:24:11]</a>. Key principles for good sleep hygiene include:
*   **Consistent Wake-Up Time:** Wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate the body's internal clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:29">[02:24:29]</a>.
*   **Natural Light Exposure:** Expose yourself to natural light for at least 30 minutes upon waking, as it is the main regulator of the circadian cycle in the hypothalamus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:56">[02:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:01">[02:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:50">[02:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:06">[02:29:06]</a>.
*   **Caffeine and Alcohol Avoidance:** Avoid caffeine after 3 PM due to its long half-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:04">[02:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:12">[02:25:12]</a>.
*   **Light and Noise Control:** Reduce exposure to white light (from screens, bright room lights) and loud noises at least three hours before bedtime, as they inhibit melatonin production and increase alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. Use red or orange light, which mimics natural fire light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:33">[02:26:33]</a>.
*   **Bed Use:** Reserve the bed primarily for sleep and sexual activity, avoiding work or extended screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:01">[02:28:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid Clock-Watching:** If waking up at night, avoid looking at the clock to prevent anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:15">[02:28:15]</a>.

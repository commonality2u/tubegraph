[[Crime Scene Investigation | Crime scene investigation]] involves a meticulous process to gather evidence and reconstruct events, often relying on specialized teams and advanced [[forensic_techniques_and_tools | forensic techniques and tools]]. This process is crucial for understanding the circumstances of a crime, identifying perpetrators, and presenting findings in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Homicide Department (DHPP)

The DHPP (Homicide Department and Protection of the Person) in São Paulo handles homicides of unknown authorship where the crime scene is preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>. If a victim is removed from the scene, another unit, the Crimes Against Crimes Expertise Unit, typically takes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. DHPP also handles cases that initially involve missing persons but later become homicide investigations, such as the Marcos Matsunaga case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. While their primary area is São Paulo, teams may travel to other cities if requested by local delegates for support in complex cases, especially those involving politicians or high-profile victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Professional Roles

A multidisciplinary team responds to crime scenes, particularly for homicides with unknown perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:51">[02:10:51]</a>:
*   **Delegates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>
*   **Clerks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
*   **Investigators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
*   **Papiloscopists** (fingerprint experts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
*   **Criminal Experts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
*   **Photographers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>

The Superintendence of Technical Police also provides specialized teams that work exclusively for DHPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>. These experts become specialized in homicides of unknown authorship, which comprise approximately 99% of their caseload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>.

## Initial Scene Response

The immediate goal at a [[crime_scene_investigation | crime scene]] is initial care to preserve and collect all traces of evidence as completely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. This includes rapidly documenting perishable evidence like bloodstains, which can dissolve in rain, or shell casings, which can be washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>. The team works to reduce contamination by controlling access to the scene, ensuring that personnel do not inadvertently destroy or alter evidence (e.g., stepping on a bloodstain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>.

## Evidence Collection and Analysis

Investigators utilize various methods for [[handling_and_interpretation_of_evidence | handling and interpretation of evidence]]:

*   **Bloodstain Analysis:** A simple bloodstain can provide extensive information, such as the height from which it fell, speed, whether it resulted from a gunshot, if the victim coughed blood, or if they were running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. It can also indicate the time since death, as blood begins to separate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.
*   **Luminol:** Used to reveal latent (invisible) blood traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>. It reacts with iron in hemoglobin and other substances like bleach, but more precise tests are needed to confirm it as human blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>.
*   **PK-Cut Test:** Originally for detecting blood in feces, this test can confirm the presence of human blood from even tiny quantities (around four nanograms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:03">[03:57:03]</a>.
*   **DNA Extraction:** Once human blood is confirmed, DNA can be extracted to identify whose blood it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>. DNA can also be found in sweat or other biological residues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:43">[04:05:43]</a>. Even after cleaning, blood can be absorbed into porous surfaces (like wood or grout) and reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:23">[04:00:23]</a>.
*   **[[Forensic Techniques and Tools | Forensic Light Sources]]**: Specialized lights with pure frequencies (e.g., ultraviolet) can stimulate molecules in substances to reveal hidden evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>. Filters (like orange glasses) help visualize these reactions, and photographs can materialize the findings for court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:56">[04:22:56]</a>.
*   **Hair Analysis:** Hair can contain chromosomal DNA (if the root is present) or mitochondrial DNA (from the hair shaft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:58">[04:29:58]</a>. Mitochondrial DNA links to the maternal line, which can include or exclude individuals from a family, but it cannot individualize a suspect for conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>.

## Challenges in Investigations

[[Challenges in criminal investigations | Challenges in criminal investigations]] are numerous and can impact the accuracy and admissibility of evidence:

*   **Contamination:** A primary concern is preventing cross-contamination of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. This requires strict adherence to procedures, such as changing gloves for each material collected and carefully sealing evidence bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:14">[01:56:14]</a>. Any deviation from standard operating procedures (SOPs) can lead to doubts and potentially nullify evidence in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Maintaining a strict [[handling_and_interpretation_of_evidence | chain of custody]] is vital for evidence integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>. This involves meticulous documentation of who handled the material, when, what was done to it, and how it was sealed and transported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>. Proper storage conditions (e.g., filtered air circulation, refrigeration) are crucial for samples like DNA to prevent deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:23">[02:02:23]</a>.
*   **Estimating Time of Death:** This is critical for including or excluding suspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. While forensic science provides parameters (e.g., body temperature drop, rigor mortis), environmental factors (like ambient temperature, clothing) create many variables that make precise estimation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. Experience allows investigators to develop a "catalog" of observations, but exact rules are hard to formulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>.
*   **Witness Credibility and Inducement:** Witnesses can be influenced or induced to give desired answers, making their testimony less reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:56">[02:44:56]</a>. Investigators must be careful not to induce answers during questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:08">[02:52:08]</a>.
*   **Public Perception and Media Influence:** Sensationalized media portrayals, especially in movies and TV shows, can create unrealistic expectations about [[forensic_investigation_techniques | forensic investigation techniques]] and criminal behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This can also lead to public misinformation and misinterpretations of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
*   **Outdated Policies:** Brazil's criminal justice system still faces challenges with outdated policies, such as the limited size of the National DNA Bank (100,000 samples for a population of 230 million) and disparate ID systems across states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:26">[03:08:26]</a>.

## Simulated Reproductions and Behavioral Analysis

Simulated reproductions (reconstructions) are conducted to re-enact the crime based on witness or suspect accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:03">[03:14:03]</a>. During these, investigators observe inconsistencies between the stated actions and the physical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>. Psychologists often participate to help understand human behavior during traumatic events, as memory can block out parts of an incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.

Behavioral analysis helps understand the motivations and characteristics of criminals. For example, some individuals who commit violent acts may have personality disorders like psychopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Psychopathy is a personality trait characterized by a lack of empathy and emotional coldness, but its development can vary greatly depending on external factors like upbringing and societal influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

### Case Examples

#### Suzane von Richthofen Case

The investigation into the murders of Manfred and Marísia von Richthofen highlighted several aspects of [[forensic_investigation_techniques | forensic investigation techniques]]:
*   **Crime Scene:** The house was found to be "impeccably tidy" in the lower part, but the upstairs master suite, where the bodies were, showed signs of violence and a staged robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:09">[04:55:09]</a>. Jewelry was found scattered in a way that seemed intentionally disorganized, suggesting a simulation rather than a genuine robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">[05:48:47]</a>.
*   **Evidence and Inconsistencies:** The victims had severe blunt force trauma injuries, not firearm wounds, indicating extreme violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:57">[05:46:57]</a>. The type of injuries suggested at least two perpetrators were involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. Suzane's account of finding her parents and her actions afterward, such as asking for a motel receipt for an alibi and giving specific details about hidden money, raised suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Profile:** Suzane was described as highly intelligent and seductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. Her inability to fake empathy, a core characteristic of psychopathy, made her behavior seem cold and indifferent, especially given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. Her attempts to create a "perfect crime" or justify her actions through false narratives (e.g., being abused by her father) were recognized as manipulative strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>.

#### Elize Matsunaga Case

This case is notorious for the dismemberment of the victim:
*   **Crime Scene:** The apartment, a duplex, was extensively searched for evidence. Initially, there were no visible signs of blood, but investigators suspected the bathtub in the master suite as the quartering location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>.
*   **Evidence Discovery:** Luminol was used to reveal latent blood traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:21">[02:05:21]</a>. Crucially, the discovery that Elize had disposed of the mattress used during the crime (given to a maid) led investigators to retrieve it, and it tested positive for blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. Blood residue was also found in wooden joints and even indicated circular cleaning movements on walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.
*   **Dismemberment Analysis:** The Coroner's report indicated that the dismemberment was performed by at least two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Cuts on the knees and abdominal region showed surgical precision, suggesting knowledge of human anatomy, while cuts on the upper limbs and neck were less precise, indicating a lack of such knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:32">[02:50:32]</a>.
*   **Premeditation vs. Explosion:** Evidence such as the purchase of an electric saw a week before the murder (allegedly for garden pruning or opening wine boxes) suggested premeditation rather than a spontaneous act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. Elize's changing story during simulated reproductions, including the implausible distance from which she claimed to have shot the victim (1.92 meters, which would leave no firing residue), also pointed to her deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:33">[02:17:33]</a>.

#### Garanhuns Cannibals Case

This case involved a chilling ritualistic aspect:
*   **Modus Operandi:** Jorge, a schizophrenic, along with Bruna and his wife, committed murders as part of a "purification" ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:26">[03:14:26]</a>. They targeted "useless people," often homeless individuals, offering them jobs, then killing, dismembering, and consuming their flesh as part of a belief that the body is sacred and cannot be discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence:** Jorge kept a diary documenting his thoughts and actions, which became crucial evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:17">[03:16:17]</a>. They even sold meat pastries (coxinha) containing human flesh to the community, including the daughter of one of the victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:56">[03:16:56]</a>.
*   **Psychological Aspects:** The case highlights how a mental disorder like schizophrenia, coupled with a lack of empathy and a desire for "purification," can lead to extreme acts of violence and cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:51">[03:15:51]</a>.

## [[Impact of crime investigations on professionals | Impact of Forensic Investigations on Professionals]]

Forensic professionals must possess an "emotional absurdity" and psychological resilience far beyond a normal human being due to constant exposure to gruesome crime scenes and disturbed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:24">[02:21:24]</a>. While the initial shock might fade, a certain indifference to life and death can develop over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:58">[02:21:58]</a>. They often refer to crime scenes as "speaking" to them, learning a "silent language" from the dust, the place, and the deceased to uncover what others cannot see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>. Their role is to give a "voice to the dead" by uncovering the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>.

The Earth has experienced multiple mass extinction events throughout its history, with evidence suggesting a sixth event may be underway. These events are often linked to drastic environmental shifts, including [[climate_change_and_environmental_impact | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Past Mass Extinctions

Historically, the Earth has undergone five major mass extinction events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. These events significantly altered the course of [[evolution_of_life_and_species | life and species]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>.

### The Great Oxygenation Event (First Extinction)
Around 2.4 to 2.7 billion years ago, the "great oxygen crisis" occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. This event was not caused by external factors, but by the [[evolution_of_life_and_species | evolution]] of cyanobacteria, which began performing aerobic photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. This process released significant amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. For organisms that did not use oxygen, this atmospheric change was catastrophic, leading to their widespread death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. This marks a unique instance of an extinction caused by living organisms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

### The Permian Extinction
Approximately 250 to 252 million years ago, the Permian extinction, the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:39">[01:46:39]</a>. This event is believed to have been caused by intense volcanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>, leading to severe [[climate_change_and_environmental_impact | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. Atmospheric CO2 levels are estimated to have reached 2500 parts per million (ppm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:56">[01:46:56]</a>, and the planet's average temperature increased by approximately 8 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:22">[01:47:22]</a>. This resulted in the extinction of over 95% of aquatic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. The Earth narrowly avoided a Venus-like fate, where continuous volcanic activity led to an uninhabitable atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>.

### The Dinosaur Extinction
The fifth great extinction, which wiped out the dinosaurs, occurred 66 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. This event is widely attributed to the impact of an [[asteroids_and_comets_impact_on_Earth | asteroid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. The impact led to a drastic decrease in productivity, with any animal weighing more than 25 kg perishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>. This cleared ecological niches, allowing smaller mammals to thrive and eventually dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>. The period immediately following the impact saw drastic changes in food availability and atmospheric composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:57">[02:01:57]</a>.

## The Sixth Mass Extinction: A Present Concern
Some researchers argue that humanity may be living through the sixth mass extinction event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. This is due to an unprecedented acceleration of species extinction rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>. While past [[climate_change_and_environmental_impact | climate changes]] and extinctions occurred over millions of years due to natural processes (like volcanism or [[asteroids_and_comets_impact_on_Earth | asteroid]] impacts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>, the current changes are happening at a significantly faster rate, observable within a human lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>.

The rise in CO2 levels, for example, from 280 ppm to 400 ppm in the last 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>, is a rapid change compared to geological timescales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>. The rapid shifts in weather patterns and temperatures witnessed in places like SÃ£o Paulo over weeks, not millennia, demonstrate the speed of current environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:17">[02:05:17]</a>. This rate of change is a critical concern, as organisms, including humans, may not be able to adapt quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>.

While the planet has always undergone natural cycles of warming and cooling (e.g., Milankovitch cycles that span 80,000 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>, the current rate of change is much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. The fear is that while Earth will persist, life as we know it, including *Homo sapiens*, may not endure these rapid shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>.

## Future Projections
Looking forward, geological evidence suggests that continents will regroup into a supercontinent (Pangea Ultima) in approximately 250 million years, which is projected to cause another mass extinction due to desertification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:03">[03:13:03]</a>. Furthermore, in about 1 billion years, the Sun's increasing brightness is likely to cause Earth's oceans to evaporate, making the planet largely uninhabitable for current life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:46">[03:13:46]</a>. Finally, in roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will expand into a red giant, engulfing Earth and the inner planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:08">[03:14:08]</a>.

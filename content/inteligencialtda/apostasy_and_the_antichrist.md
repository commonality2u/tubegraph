The topic of [[Biblical Prophecies and End Times | the end times]] is significantly marked by two key signs of proximity: apostasy and the revealing of the Antichrist, as indicated by Jesus [02:24:08]. These are understood as signals that the return of Christ is near [02:23:55].

## Apostasy
Apostasy refers to the abandonment of truth [02:24:22]. It is characterized by the growth of false churches that turn away from biblical truth to embrace lies [02:24:27]. This phenomenon involves people departing from the faith by listening to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, seeking teachers who cater to their own desires rather than the truth [02:24:37]. They become unable to hear the truth and instead gravitate towards fables and "crazy miraculous things" [02:24:49].

As iniquity multiplies, love is prophesied to grow cold [02:25:02]. This involves God removing the "brakes" from humanity, leading to a state where there are no rules, no laws, and no boundaries for sin [02:25:10]. People would become unrestrained, acting without affection, like animals, and disregarding established norms [02:25:52]. Examples cited include the celebration of abortion legalization and the inversion of values where killing an animal carries a heavier penalty than killing a human [02:26:06].

### Societal Manifestations of Apostasy
*   **Decline of Moral Boundaries**: An increase in unbridled behavior without rules or laws [02:25:52].
*   **Inversion of Values**: Instances where actions against human life are celebrated, or where penalties for harming animals are more severe than for harming humans [02:26:06].
*   **Erosion of Family Unit**: Attacks on the traditional family structure, including ideologies that undermine marital fidelity and promote gender-affirming surgeries for minors without parental consent [01:59:54].

## The Antichrist
The Antichrist is described as the incarnation of Satan, an envoy sent by him [02:27:52]. He is not the devil himself [02:27:47], but rather a figure embodying political and military power, referred to as "the beast that comes out of the sea" in the Bible [02:28:01]. He will serve as the head of a global political and military system, aiming to establish his own kingdom and persecute Christians during a period known as the [[Tribulation and Biblical prophecy | Great Tribulation]] [02:28:38].

The rise of the Antichrist is likened to a vulture being attracted to carrion; the widespread apostasy and iniquity in the world will create the conditions for his appearance [02:27:20].

### The Mark of the Beast (666)
During the [[Tribulation and Biblical prophecy | Great Tribulation]], the Antichrist will enforce the "mark of the beast" [02:30:33]. This mark is interpreted not as a physical chip, but as an ideological or philosophical submission [02:31:31]. Those who accept this mark love and worship the wicked, corrupt world and its concepts [02:32:01].

The inability to buy or sell without the mark [02:32:42] is explained as a system of boycott and blocking for those who oppose the Antichrist's ideologies and refuse to participate in his corrupt agenda [02:33:22]. This reflects historical boycotts and social exclusions faced by early Christians who refused to worship the Roman Emperor [02:34:57].

The number 666, associated with the mark, is understood as a human number [02:36:00]. It symbolizes the devil's frustrated imitation of God's perfection (represented by the number seven); six is "almost seven" but never reaches it, signifying a defeated and failed imitation [02:36:04].

### Rapture and Tribulation
The rapture is understood to occur at the end of the [[Tribulation and Biblical prophecy | Great Tribulation]] [02:29:08]. This perspective, often called amillennialism, distinguishes between tribulation and the wrath of God [02:30:11]. Tribulation is seen as a test or trial that the church will endure, facing intense persecution under the Antichrist's government [02:30:23]. The Holy Spirit remains with God's people during this time, as He is omnipresent [02:31:02].

This understanding contrasts with the "pre-tribulationist" doctrine, which suggests a secret rapture of the church before the tribulation begins. The pre-tribulationist view is criticized for fostering a "second chance" mentality, where individuals might live a "carnal life" believing they can still be saved if they miss the first rapture and then die for Christ during the tribulation [02:47:30]. This is deemed unsupported by scripture and potentially dangerous [02:48:35].

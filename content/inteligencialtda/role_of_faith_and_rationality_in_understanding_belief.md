The concept of "skepticism of faith" might seem paradoxical, but it highlights the idea that doubt can be a necessary component for belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>. True faith, in this context, is considered rational and supported by evidence, distinguishing it from [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_faith_practice | fideism or superstition]], which involves believing without any basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

## Faith and Evidence

The argument is made that a believer is someone who believes because they have evidence to do so, whereas a "gullible" person believes simply for the sake of belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Skepticism in Science and Faith

Just as some physicists believe in concepts like dark matter, dark energy, or multiverses without direct observable proof, relying instead on mathematical calculations and inferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>, so too can faith be understood through signs and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:27">[06:32:27]</a>. The universe itself, with its apparent planning, can be seen as evidence pointing to a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:46">[05:48:46]</a>.

[!quote] Analogy of the Dog Food
"If I come into your studio, which is really cool by the way, and I see a can of dog food on the floor here, I didn't see the dog, but I can infer from the dog food that you have a dog. An atheist needs a comparison; he'd say, 'No, I didn't see a puppy. Okay, but the dog food must have a rational explanation for its presence here, but it doesn't mean there's a dog in the house unless I see a poster, I see a dog.' He can see the food, but he can't understand it means there's a dog. He doesn't work with the hypothesis of a dog. He doesn't see God's fingerprint in the universe, even though it was planned." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:17">[05:59:17]</a>

### The "God of the Gaps"

The phrase "God of the Gaps" is often used pejoratively to imply that believers use God to fill in what science cannot yet explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:09">[10:17:09]</a>. However, it's argued that both atheists and believers fill gaps in understanding. While atheists might fill them with theories like the multiverse, believers fill them with the hypothesis of God as a first cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:20">[11:01:20]</a>.

## Faith and Scientific Theories

### Evolution and Creationism

There are three main approaches to the [[secularism_and_religious_truth_debate | relationship between evolution and faith]]:
1.  **Explanatory Evolution**: Scientists who believe that evolution fully explains life, negating the need for God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:09">[11:38:09]</a>.
2.  **Strict Creationism**: Those who believe that the theory of evolution does not adequately explain the origin of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:17">[11:46:17]</a>.
3.  **Theistic Evolution**: An intermediate group that believes God used evolution to bring everything into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:19">[11:54:19]</a>.

The speaker aligns with the third view, acknowledging Darwin's genius and the explanatory power of "microevolution" (adaptation within a species), exemplified by virus variants or finch beak changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:01">[12:26:01]</a>. However, they express skepticism about "macroevolution" (one species becoming another), citing a lack of fossil evidence for transitional forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:23">[14:00:23]</a>.

### Archaeology and Biblical Historicity

Archaeology does not "prove" the Bible in a scientific sense, as the scientific method is not designed for such theological proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. However, it helps in two key ways:
1.  **Contextual Understanding**: Archaeology sheds light on the biblical context, aiding in the interpretation of passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
2.  **Verifying Historicity**: It allows for checking whether biblical accounts are fact or myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. Unlike other religious texts where characters might be mythological, the Bible points to historical facts and puts itself to the test through its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>. For instance, the crucifixion of Jesus, while a historical event, gains its theological significance through the belief in his resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, which is supported by early Christian belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## The Role of Reason in Faith

While [[role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_struggles | faith]] can be a personal experience, it is also supported by reason. The Bible itself encourages questioning and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>.

[!quote] Faith as a Platform
The concept of a "leap of faith" is reinterpreted as a "platform of faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:22">[02:06:22]</a>.
"If I'm in a building that's on fire and I'm desperate, then I see a door, I go with my hand on the doorknob to open that door. In a little while, a voice shouts behind me, saying, 'No, don't do this.' And when I turn, a comrade of the Fire Department, with that yellow outfit and everything, says, 'Don't touch the door, don't open it, come back slowly.' I'm not stupid, of course he has his reasons, the authority. Suddenly the door is hot, suddenly there's a draft there, and he knows what he's doing. If I am a smart guy, I obey without questioning, I obey by faith. Now, if I want to act like a logic girl, I have to obey. Now I'm going to change the situation a little bit. I'm again in the fire, going there, following my survival instinct when the first situation, but instead of coming behind me shouting, a fireman comes, a crazy schizophrenic girl. The road against schizophrenia is a disease that people who have it have to be respected and treated. I'm here wanting to be a pamphleteer, it's just an illustration. A girl I know is crazy. 'Rodrigo, Rodrigo, come with me here, give me your hand, we will fly away by that window.' What if I give up on my plan that comes out for him to come back and give his hand to the girl? There, I can't. I can't be smart. I'm being crazy. What is the difference between the two cases? I will explain to you. In the first case, in both cases, I obey without questioning, only in the first case I have evidence prior to the moment of the fire that they tell me that firefighters know what to do at that time. Firefighters are trained to be a rational feeling, and therefore at the time of fire, when I do not have all the answers, the previous rational evidence helped me to obey the fireman without questioning. This is obeying by faith. But I have no rational proof that that girl knows what she's doing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:22">[02:06:22]</a>

Therefore, [[faith_spirituality_and_the_existence_of_God | faith]] does not negate reason or evidence; rather, it is informed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>. This is described as "rational worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:45">[02:10:45]</a>.

## Faith and Morality

The discussion also touches upon the source of universal ethics. Without a transcendent principle like God, actions like Nazism, though locally condemned, might lack a universal ethical justification. The argument is that without a universal principle, all arguments for good or bad become localized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

[!info] Personal vs. Religious Morality
It is acknowledged that many atheists demonstrate more love and charity than some religious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. The question then becomes: "And you do good based on what?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>. This philosophical inquiry seeks the ultimate meaning and purpose of life and the source of universal ethical principles that are not tied to specific cultures or ephemeral trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

The more one studies, the more evidence of God can be found in history, actions, and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that God does not need lawyers but rather witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:16">[02:05:16]</a>. Faith is a personal experience that encourages others to try it themselves, as it offers a sense of being loved by God, which is considered the "best of all therapies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:37">[02:00:37]</a>. This perspective highlights the profound impact of [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | faith]] on an individual's [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | life transformation]], offering a new identity beyond simply being a "better citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.

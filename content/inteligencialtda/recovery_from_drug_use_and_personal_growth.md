Raquel Pacheco, known as Bruna Surfistinha, openly discussed her journey through drug use, particularly cocaine, and her subsequent path to recovery and personal growth. This period of her life was marked by significant challenges but ultimately led to profound self-discovery and transformation.

## The Onset of Drug Use

During her adolescence, around 16 to 17 years old, Raquel's rebellious phase intensified, leading her to experiment with substances. She began smoking marijuana and drinking, associating with peers who shared her "vibe" of not wanting to study or conform [00:36:35]. This behavior escalated when her father cut off her allowance and privileges, pushing her to steal from her parents to fund her teenage addictions [00:38:17]. She describes finding pleasure in the danger and adrenaline of doing "very wrong things" [00:39:11].

Her use of cocaine began about two months into her prostitution career, around her first Christmas away from home [01:58:03]. At a party with colleagues, she was encouraged to try cocaine with the promise that it would help her forget her family and suffering, a "giant brainwashing" moment for her [01:58:34]. She noted that cocaine "hits you right away," but its effect wears off quickly [01:59:08]. A significant portion of her initial earnings from prostitution was spent on cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol [01:59:59].

## The Turning Point: Overdose and a Promise

Raquel's drug use culminated in a near-fatal overdose. Although the movie adaptation of her life depicted this differently, the actual event occurred at dawn while she was with friends, smoking, sniffing, and drinking [02:46:29]. She experienced severe heart problems, feeling as though her heart was about to explode before it "practically stopped" due to an "overload" [02:46:42], as confirmed by a doctor [02:49:24]. She woke up in the hospital, scared [02:47:03].

During this critical moment, Raquel describes a "dream or delirium" where she spoke to a "person all in white" [02:47:32]. This entity made it clear that it was her "last chance" and that she "was supposed to have died this time" but would receive "a new chance" [02:47:50]. In this powerful experience, she made a promise never to use cocaine or marijuana again [02:47:46]. To this day, she has adhered to this promise, though she acknowledges still smoking cigarettes, noting that asking for more would be "too much for one person" [02:48:08]. Raquel attributes this experience to something [[spirituality_and_personal_growth | spiritual]] that gave her a vital lesson [02:48:48].

## The Recovery Process and Personal Growth

The immediate aftermath of her overdose led Raquel to commit to a life free from drugs. To prevent relapse, she had to return to [[personal_development_and_therapy | therapy]] [02:51:36] and was prescribed medication to control [[personal_development_and_therapy | anxiety]] [02:51:41]. She confined herself mostly to her home, focusing on writing as a coping mechanism to avoid exposure to environments or people that could trigger her former habits [02:51:27].

Her journey through prostitution itself also played a role in her [[personal_development_and_therapy | personal development]]. Despite the challenges, it provided her with a unique perspective on human relationships, which she describes as "the most faithful human relationship... because no one fools anyone there" [01:37:53]. She recognized it as an opportunity to gain experience and understand people, leveraging her interest in psychology [01:39:09]. Prostitution became a means to gain [[navigating_personal_and_professional_challenges | independence]] and distance herself from her strained family life [01:12:08].

> "My pleasure was to give was also was much more to see than to give pleasure to the man because I had no [[christianity_selfesteem_and_healing_messages | self-esteem]] none me I thought it was ugly I never thought I was pretty, I never thought I was pretty like that so I my [[christianity_selfesteem_and_healing_messages | self-esteem]] it was below zero so there was no no [[christianity_selfesteem_and_healing_messages | self-esteem]] so the fact of giving pleasure for men delicious I started to understand how to value myself just like woman kind of start to me seeing with a woman yes to me can exactly that and such was I didn't know that yes, it was thanks to my clients" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>

She also learned to value herself, realizing that the attention and pleasure she gave to men helped her to see herself as a woman and rebuild her [[christianity_selfesteem_and_healing_messages | self-esteem]], which had previously been "below zero" [01:40:02].

## Current Life and Outlook

Today, Raquel continues to focus on her [[family_and_personal_life_developments | family]], particularly her twin daughters, Maria and Elisa, born last year [03:13:12], whom she considers a answered prayer as she always wished for two children close in age [03:38:18]. She describes the constant demands of motherhood, especially with twins who are learning to walk and talk, as a "very big responsibility" [03:40:48]. However, she cherishes "every day there is an evolution" [03:37:40].

Reflecting on her past, Raquel acknowledges the "very difficult" decision to leave home at 17, choosing an unknown path over guaranteed safety [03:47:10]. She states she has "no doubts" that her escape and first day in prostitution were the most challenging moments [03:49:23]. She advises young people to "enjoy your 20s" and live life fully, regretting that her own 20s were largely consumed by her marriage [03:52:12].

Despite her past, Raquel views her life as a testament to overcoming adversity, believing she "got it right" in the end [03:51:11]. She advocates for learning through "love" rather than "pain" when it comes to raising children, a lesson drawn from her own experiences [00:59:31]. She hopes that people will see beyond her three years in prostitution and recognize the full arc of her life and ongoing [[personal_growth_and_therapy | personal growth]] [03:20:51].

The topic of election interference and the integrity of voting systems in Brazil, particularly concerning the 2022 general election, has been a central point of discussion and legal challenge, primarily from supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These discussions often take place in programs like "Limited Intelligence," which aim to delve into the intricacies of Brazilian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## The 2022 General Election: Claims of Irregularities

Jair Bolsonaro's camp has expressed numerous concerns and made allegations regarding the fairness and outcomes of the 2022 elections.

### TSE's Role and Controversial Decisions
The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) is a focal point of these concerns. Bolsonaro claims that when he raised suspicion of fraud in his election, the TSE determined that the Federal Police (PF) should initiate an inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Conversely, when Lula won and petitions were filed by Bolsonaro's side, they reportedly received a negative response and a R$22 million fine, which Bolsonaro argues is unprecedented for a lawyer petitioning a judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. This fine was seen as sarcasm and humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

A general rule states that any electoral law must come into force one year before elections, and any resolution six months before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. However, a TSE resolution was issued in mid-October 2022, between the first and second rounds of the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This resolution, despite a vote from Minister Carmem Lúcia against censorship, was perceived as an "exceptional case" and a "final effort" by Alexandre de Moraes to prevent right-wing pages from freely disclosing Bolsonaro's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

### Campaign Restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro
During the pre-election period, decisions by Alexandre de Moraes reportedly prevented Bolsonaro from showing images related to the September 7th campaign event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. He was also reportedly unable to use images of Lula defending abortion, or an image of Lula suggesting leniency for cell phone theft to buy beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Bolsonaro states he couldn't show any images that would be detrimental to his opponent's campaign, while accusations against him (e.g., genocidal, racist, homophobic) went unchecked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>. He also claims that 1.5 million radio inserts disappeared and did not appear anywhere, which he attributes to heavy-handed TSE influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>.

### Youth Voter Mobilization and Bias Claims
The TSE also allegedly spent money on a campaign encouraging young people aged 16 and 17 to obtain their voter titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Bolsonaro claims this age group predominantly votes for the left, estimating that over 4 million young people contributed more than 2 million votes to Lula through this campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

### Businessmen and Social Media Interference
A group of eight businessmen, including Luciano Hang, were labeled "scam businessmen" for "talking nonsense" in private conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Luciano Hang's page, with 10 million followers, which campaigned for Bolsonaro, was also reportedly removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

## The Pix System: Development and Impact

The Pix payment system was introduced in November 2020 during Bolsonaro's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. Bolsonaro clarifies that while the press attributes it to the Central Bank, it was implemented under his administration with the Central Bank president Campos as his appointee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. He notes that the system was expedited due to the need to distribute emergency aid during the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly 40 million people who previously lacked bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Pix, being free and instantaneous, caused bankers to lose over R$20 billion annually from fees on TED and DOC transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. It also reportedly reduced street violence by minimizing cash circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The current government is accused of looking to tax Pix, seeing the R$100 billion daily movement as a potential revenue source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## Post-Election Legal Challenges and Accusations

Following the 2022 elections, Bolsonaro and his allies faced a wave of legal challenges and accusations, particularly concerning the January 8th events and alleged attempts to undermine democracy.

### Ambassador Meeting and Ineligibility Accusations
Bolsonaro's ineligibility stems from a meeting with ambassadors in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:32">[02:13:32]</a>. He claims this meeting focused on discussing inquiry 1361, which concerned alleged fraud in his election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>. The Federal Police allegedly used this meeting as a pretext to initiate broad investigations, engaging in "evidentiary fishing" (fishing expedition), a practice prohibited by the Supreme Federal Court (STF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>.

### January 8th Events: Accusations of a Coup
The events of January 8th, 2023, where government buildings were stormed, led to accusations that Bolsonaro had orchestrated a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. Bolsonaro strongly denies this, arguing that he was out of the country (in the United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a> and had condemned the events via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. He points out that he had already appointed new force commanders in December, making a coup after handing over power illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

He claims the events were "set up" by the new government to simulate a coup, citing Lula's absence from Brasília on January 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. Bolsonaro states no weapons were found at the legislative police station of the Federal Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>, and that the violence was not comparable to a coup, which requires troops, tanks, leadership, and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. He asserts that the financial means to support such a large-scale operation were absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.

He also highlights that the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) sent over 30 messages to the GSI (Institutional Security Cabinet) from Friday to Sunday regarding the possibility of riots, but no action was taken by the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Furthermore, images from nearly 200 security cameras in government buildings were reportedly deleted by the Minister of Justice, Flávio Dino, which Bolsonaro sees as evidence that the government is hiding facts that would incriminate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

#### Military Intervention and Article 142
The discussion often involves Article 142 of the Brazilian Constitution, which outlines the role of the Armed Forces. Bolsonaro's supporters displayed posters referencing this article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. Bolsonaro clarifies that Article 142 does not permit military intervention, but rather describes the Armed Forces' role under the President's authority for homeland defense and guaranteeing constitutional powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. He believes the Supreme Court's interpretation has made this item "practically non-existent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

#### The "Coup Minutes" and Investigative Practices
Accusations against Bolsonaro include the existence of "coup minutes" or a draft coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Bolsonaro denies the existence of such documents, stating that no one would put a coup plan on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. He argues that the investigation against him is filled with illegalities, including a lack of spontaneity, truth, and proof in the denunciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, and that the prosecution has not shown the alleged "coup minutes" or related evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

#### Mauro Cid's Plea Bargain
Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former aide, is central to several investigations. Bolsonaro claims Cid's plea bargain was coerced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, with Alexandre de Moraes allegedly threatening Cid and his family (father, wife, daughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. He states that a judge cannot participate in a plea bargain and that it shouldn't be signed with an arrested defendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. An alleged leaked audio of Cid, saying "There's no point in me telling the truth, they want me to say something to give substance to what they have in their head," is presented as proof of coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

#### Case of Débora Rodrigues dos Santos
The case of Débora Rodrigues dos Santos, a hairdresser sentenced to 14 years in prison for her involvement in the January 8th events, is highlighted as an example of judicial overreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. She was accused of "painting a statue with lipstick" and was given a disproportionate sentence, which Bolsonaro calls "absurd" and an "injustice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. The fact that the accusation is "armed criminal organization" despite no weapons being found is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>.

### Foreign Interference Claims
Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, allege foreign interference in the Brazilian elections.

#### USAID and Brazilian Elections
Eduardo Bolsonaro claims that Mike Benz, an American protagonist, has exposed the transfer of money from the United States to other countries, including Brazil, through partnerships like USAID with the TSE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. These funds were allegedly used for "press indoctrination," "reform of the judiciary," and "soft power conversations with judges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. Mike Benz reportedly tweeted that if USAID hadn't existed, Jair Bolsonaro would still be president of Brazil, indicating clear external interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

#### Chinese Influence
Eduardo Bolsonaro also mentions that China allegedly sought the Biden government to remove Bolsonaro from power, to facilitate "certain transactions" with another government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. He states that Chinese interests include satellite communication, uranium reserves, and partnerships with China Media Group for "soft power to indoctrinate people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

### Legal Processes and Perceived Bias
Bolsonaro's team argues that legal processes against him are expedited and biased, unlike those for his political opponents.

#### Speed of Legal Proceedings: Bolsonaro vs. Lula
Bolsonaro highlights the speed of his legal proceedings, noting that his ineligibility case is being judged quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. He contrasts this with Lula's legal cases, such as Mensalão (2005, trial in 2012 – 7 years later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. He argues that if he is truly "so guilty," due process should be followed, including collecting evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>.

#### TSE Fines and Political Parties
The R$22 million fine imposed on Bolsonaro's party (PL) for petitioning the TSE is cited as an example of political persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

#### Judicial Decisions and Influence
Bolsonaro alleges that some judicial decisions are influenced by political motives, pointing to the case of a delegate, Rodrigo Moraes Fernandes, who investigated the assassination attempt against him and was later promoted by Lula to director of intelligence of the Federal Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. He also notes that the STF's ruling on his decree granting grace to Deputy Daniel Silveira was "unique in the history of Brazil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:10">[02:56:10]</a>.

## Voting System Integrity

The reliability of Brazil's electronic voting system has been a contentious issue.

### The Printed Vote Debate
Bolsonaro has consistently advocated for printed votes since 2012, viewing it as a measure to prevent fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. He recalls supporting an amendment for printed ballots that was approved but later vetoed by Dilma Rousseff, and then had the veto overturned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. Bolsonaro states that his doubt about the electronic voting system is not new and that his amendment for printed votes became law before being deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:42">[01:58:42]</a>.

### Comparison with Venezuela and Paraguay
Bolsonaro cites Venezuela as an example where printed votes led to the discovery of fraud, albeit under external pressure for oil trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:33">[02:08:33]</a>. He also highlights Paraguay's system, where voters press a button, a paper prints, they agree, and the paper falls into a ballot box, allowing for recounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. He questions why asking for transparency in the vote count is considered a crime in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:38">[01:59:38]</a>.

## Other Relevant Cases and Accusations

### Corporate Card Secrecy
Bolsonaro explains that the president's corporate card is primarily for expenses related to the Alvorada Palace (residence) and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>. He states he never used his personal corporate card, which allows withdrawals of up to R$20,000 per month without strict auditing, and even delivered it with a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:17">[02:10:17]</a>. The secrecy surrounding presidential expenses, inherited from Dilma Rousseff's government, was intended to protect personal information of staff (e.g., Michelle Bolsonaro's hairdresser or manicurist) to prevent blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. When his secrecy was lifted, nothing confidential was found, unlike Lula's current government which has also applied secrecy to various matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>.

### Adélio Bispo Assassination Attempt Investigation
Bolsonaro questions the Federal Police's investigation into Adélio Bispo, the perpetrator of the 2018 assassination attempt against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>. He states that the investigation concluded Bispo acted alone, despite alleged evidence suggesting external connections, including with the PCC criminal organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:39">[02:16:39]</a>. The delegate in charge, Rodrigo Moraes Fernandes, was later promoted by Lula to a directorship in the Federal Police's intelligence sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. Bolsonaro implies a political motive behind the investigation's conclusions and the delegate's promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

### Allegations of Political Persecution
Bolsonaro frequently asserts that legal actions against him and his supporters are politically motivated. He contrasts his own legal processes with those of Lula, stating that Lula was released from jail by reinterpreting the "last instance" rule, despite having three convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. He believes the goal of these actions is to "end the largest spontaneous political movement and volunteer that my generation already watched, which is led by Jair Bolsonaro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. He claims there is a "double standard" where right-wing individuals are pursued while left-wing individuals are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>.

## Future Political Landscape

Bolsonaro maintains that he will not give up his candidacy for the 2026 election, stating that he is an "indefinable" candidate and that it is "not fair to remove Bolsonaro from the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. He asserts that he remains the strongest right-wing leader and would win if elections were held today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. His main goal is to "put an end to this injustice" and "brake a psychopath called Alexandre de Moraes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.

### Amnesty Discussion
The possibility of an amnesty for those arrested on January 8th is discussed as a "humanitarian" issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>. Bolsonaro cites the example of Fernando Henrique Cardoso pardoning a kidnapper (linked to Lula's advocacy) in the past, arguing that this precedent should apply to the "poor guys" from January 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:46">[02:03:46]</a>. He argues that amnesty is a political remedy that has been used before and should be decided by the legislative branch without judicial interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:18">[02:55:18]</a>.

Isabel Veloso, a 17-year-old, has been undergoing [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | cancer treatment]] for three years. This year, she received a diagnosis that she is a [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] patient with limited time left to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This revelation prompted her and her fiancé, Lucas, to pursue their dreams, including their wedding, which gained significant attention on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Isabel's Early Life and Diagnosis
Isabel was born in Chopinzinho, Paraná, and experienced a nomadic childhood, frequently moving between small cities due to her parents' work and her sister's college education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. These constant changes left her feeling traumatized about friendships, as she struggled to maintain connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

From a young age, Isabel was highly anxious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. Around the time she fell ill, her parents separated, and her grandfather passed away, leading to a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. One doctor even suggested that her anxiety might have triggered her cancer, though this remains unconfirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Isabel believes that when the body doesn't speak, it screams, relating her physical illness to emotional turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Her anxiety affected her school performance, making it difficult to concentrate, and she suffered from sleep issues since childhood, requiring medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.

### The Cancer Journey
Isabel's initial symptoms, including severe shortness of breath, were misdiagnosed by multiple doctors as conditions like gastritis or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. At one point, she was told her symptoms were "all in her head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>. Eventually, a doctor discovered her heart was displaced to the right side, leading to an X-ray that revealed a massive tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. Her lung had 9.5 liters of fluid, making breathing difficult, and the tumor, measuring 17x17x17 cm, compressed her heart, lungs, and trachea, causing permanent hoarseness and lung damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>. Days before her diagnosis, Isabel had an intuition during prayer that she had cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

Her diagnosis is Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The first biopsy was unclassifiable, showing sarcoma cells, but it was later confirmed as Hodgkin's lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>.

### Treatments and Near-Death Experience
Isabel underwent chemotherapy, which initially reduced the tumor size but worsened its activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:00">[33:20:00]</a>. During one intense three-day chemotherapy session, she experienced a near-death event, describing seeing herself in a black tunnel with a light at the end and feeling profound peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. She heard voices, one urging her to keep her eyes closed, feeling immense comfort, and another, like an "angel," telling her to open them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>. She awoke vomiting, deeply affected by the vivid experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>.

Later, she received immunotherapy, which stimulates the immune system to fight diseased cells and was the first treatment that proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. This led to a bone marrow transplant, where she was her own donor (autologous transplant), a process that involves a catheter insertion and can cause a strong corn-like taste due to preservatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>. After the transplant, she developed mucositis, a painful inflammation of the digestive system, requiring morphine for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. She also had to redo all her childhood vaccinations as her immune system reset, like a newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>.

### Palliative Care and Quality of Life
After further immunotherapy applications, Isabel developed severe neuropathic pain, losing movement in her legs and strength in her right arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>. This led to the decision to cease active [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | treatment]] and enter [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>. Her doctor, Melina, explained that [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] focuses on the patient as a whole—physical, emotional, spiritual, and social well-being—when a cure is no longer possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>. This shift aimed to improve Isabel's [[Living with Cancer | quality of life]] despite the limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:00">[56:37:00]</a>.

Isabel insisted on knowing an estimated time for her prognosis, and while doctors acknowledge the uncertainty, her hematologist gave an estimate of two to four months due to the tumor's location near her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:28:00">[59:28:00]</a>. Despite the difficult prognosis, Isabel prefers to believe she has "months or more" to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>. She publicly shared her palliative care report on social media to address skepticism and accusations of lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

## [[Overcoming personal challenges and resilience | Personal Outlook and Family Impact]]

### Isabel's Philosophy: "Despite the Pain, Gratitude"
Isabel never questioned God about her illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, believing that His plan is better than her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10:00">[01:05:10:00]</a>. She chose to accept her destiny, finding peace in the understanding that many people face incurable diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Her current mission is to "cure" others by leaving a positive mark on their lives, teaching them to value time and joy, rather than being cured herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

She emphasizes the importance of gratitude despite the pain, choosing to enjoy every moment and smile while she can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>. She wrote a book titled "Despite the pain, gratitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Isabel has transformed her perspective, valuing small details and the present, unlike her past where she lived on "autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.

### Fear of Death and Living in the Now
Isabel admits to fearing not death itself, but leaving behind her loved ones, particularly dying alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. She finds comfort in knowing Lucas will be with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>. She expresses missing future experiences she will not have, like a first date with Lucas or having children, and urges others to live fully for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. Her message is to live, breathe, and love for her, and to cherish every moment with loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

### [[Relationship with family and adoption issues | Family Support]]
Isabel's family was her foundation before Lucas entered her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>. Her mother quit her job to be with her in the hospital, and her father and sisters were always present and supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>. She acknowledges their profound suffering, knowing that her illness is not the natural order of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>.

### Lucas's Perspective
Lucas, Isabel's fiancé, describes his emotions as a "whirlwind," acknowledging the pain of losing the woman of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>. Despite the impending loss, he is committed to making the most of every second with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>. He views their love as beautiful and refuses to let the illness prevent them from living it fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>.

### Advice to Others
Isabel advises those with recent diagnoses or similar situations not to compare their cases to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>. She stresses that every person's organism is unique and responds differently to [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:53">[01:30:53]</a>. She encourages enjoying life, finding happiness in small things, and relying on spiritual strength or simple joys like cooking to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. Her message is one of [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_resilience | resilience]] and finding joy amidst adversity, emphasizing that "love heals a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

São Paulo, as the largest state in Brazil and the country's economic "locomotive," faces significant challenges in public administration and policy across various sectors. Policies aimed at addressing these issues range from infrastructure development and economic revitalization to improvements in social services and public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:04">[02:17:04]</a>.

## Economic and Fiscal Policy

São Paulo's economy has faced difficulties, notably from a "tax war" where other states offer greater incentives, leading to companies leaving and job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:41">[02:10:41]</a>. Key issues include:
*   **Taxation**: The state's tax system, particularly the high IPVA (Vehicle Property Tax) and ICMS (Tax on Circulation of Goods and Services), is criticized for driving businesses and car registrations to other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>. Some states offer IPVA exemptions or reductions for electric cars, which São Paulo does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>.
*   **Industrial Exodus**: Industries, including footwear, food processing, and automotive, have relocated from São Paulo to states like Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Minas Gerais due to tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:45">[02:09:45]</a>.
*   **Energy Supply**: São Paulo imports 70% of its energy consumption, making it reliant on external sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:55">[02:10:55]</a>. Opportunities for cheaper energy from natural gas (currently mostly reinjected), solid waste, sugarcane, and photovoltaic sources are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.
*   **Federal Support**: During the pandemic, the federal government provided substantial financial support to São Paulo, including direct contributions, debt payment postponements, emergency aid for families, and benefits to save companies. Over the last three years, São Paulo received 370 billion reais in mandatory transfers and 50 billion in private investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:14">[02:54:14]</a>.

Policies proposed to revitalize the economy include:
*   Reviewing ICMS rates and credit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:37">[02:11:37]</a>.
*   Implementing IPVA exemptions or discounts for electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>.
*   Ensuring credit access for small entrepreneurs, who are major job creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>.
*   Tailoring professional training to economic vocations, such as footwear design, mechanical engineering, and mechatronics, to meet industry needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:57">[02:25:57]</a>.

## Infrastructure Development

São Paulo's infrastructure is undergoing significant changes, with a focus on privatization and completing stalled projects.

### Airports
*   **Congonhas Airport**: The recent auction for Congonhas Airport, along with 14 other airports, is expected to bring substantial investment, creating 45,000 direct and indirect jobs and modernizing the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The aim is to build a new passenger terminal in an idle area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>.

### Railways
*   **Historical Context**: Early Brazilian railways, including those in São Paulo (like Paulista, Mogiana, Sorocabana), were privately built, primarily for coffee transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. During the 1930s crisis, many became financially distressed and were nationalized in the 1950s, leading to underinvestment and abandonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
*   **Modernization Efforts**: The current administration is focused on revitalizing railways through private concessions and authorizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Paulista Mesh**: The contract for the Paulista railway mesh was extended with significant investment obligations, aiming to increase its transport capacity from 15 million to 75 million tons per year over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. This includes duplicating sections, building railway contours to bypass cities, and recovering deactivated branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
    *   **Passenger Trains**: There are plans to reintroduce passenger trains, starting with the Campinas-São Paulo route, utilizing existing railway strips and rails. The goal is a medium-speed train (120 km/h) to connect cities like Campinas, Americana, Limeira, Sorocaba, and São José dos Campos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:49">[02:39:49]</a>. The financial model for passenger trains relies heavily on real estate exploration around stations, transforming them into business centers rather than just transit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.
    *   **Subway Lines**: Delays in extending subway lines (e.g., Line 17 to Congonhas and Jabaquara, Line 4 to Taboão or Cotia) are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a>.

### Ports
*   **Port of Santos**: The government is pursuing the privatization of the Port of Santos, aiming to resolve issues with regulatory models and attract investment. The model seeks to ensure legal security for existing operators, prevent anti-competitive behavior, and generate investment while lowering service fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. Santos is the largest port in Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>.

### Roads
*   **BR-163 Paving**: The completion of paving on BR-163 in the Amazon region significantly improved logistics for agricultural production from Mato Grosso, providing a cheaper route to northern ports and impacting freight costs for São Paulo’s exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>.
*   **Concessions**: New highway concessions in São Paulo, like Dutra and Paraná stations, are structured to include rest stops for truckers and lower toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. Future plans include removing toll plazas and adopting a "free flow" system, where drivers pay based on mileage traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:17">[02:49:17]</a>.

## Social Services and Public Safety

São Paulo faces significant challenges in providing adequate social services and ensuring public safety.

### Education
*   **Proficiency**: 90% of high school students in São Paulo lack proficiency in Portuguese and mathematics, highlighting a severe deficit in public education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a>.

### Healthcare
*   **Surgery Queue**: There is a substantial queue of 540,000 Paulistas awaiting elective surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:08">[02:18:08]</a>.
*   **Primary Care**: A major policy goal is to increase the effectiveness of primary healthcare to reduce the burden on emergency rooms and high-complexity hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>. This involves promoting digital health, telemedicine, and better integration of electronic medical records across health units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>.
*   **Hospital System**: Prioritizing the restoration and operationalization of existing hospitals and *Santa Casas* (charitable hospitals) before building new regional hospitals is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:19">[02:41:19]</a>. The philanthropic system in São Paulo requires financial oxygenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:36">[02:41:36]</a>.
*   **SUS Table**: The SUS (Unified Health System) remuneration table is outdated, affecting the financial viability of philanthropic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:19">[02:42:19]</a>.
*   **Queue Management**: Improving queue management for medical appointments and surgeries, linking patient positions to specific regions, and implementing clinical follow-up are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>.
*   **Aging Population**: The state needs to prepare its healthcare structure for an aging population, including long-term support hospitals and shelter houses for elderly patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
*   **Preventive Care**: Investing in preventive care, especially for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, is crucial to avoid severe cases and reduce hospitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:06">[02:45:06]</a>. Early cancer diagnosis is also emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:53">[02:45:53]</a>.

### Sanitation and Water Resources
*   **River Depollution**: The Tietê and Pinheiros rivers in São Paulo suffer from significant pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. The approach to depollution involves investing in connections to interceptor networks, constructing both large and smaller-scale treatment stations, and implementing technologies to treat already contaminated water bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:32">[02:48:32]</a>.
*   **Water Losses**: São Paulo experiences high non-technical water losses in its supply network, exceeding 20% in some areas, due to factors like low pressure and leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>. Investment in network monitoring and combating leaks is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:13">[02:16:13]</a>.
*   **Water Reuse**: Advancing in water reuse initiatives is critical for water security in the highly populated metropolitan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:22">[02:16:22]</a>.
*   **Springs and Dams**: Recovering natural springs and dams like Billings could improve water supply and potentially generate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>.

### Public Safety
*   **Police Deficit**: São Paulo faces a deficit of almost 15,000 civil police officers and a military police force with declining effective numbers despite population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:28">[02:19:28]</a>.
*   **Proposed Solutions**:
    *   Reinforcing police staff and improving career plans and salaries to retain personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>.
    *   Focusing on monitoring criminals at large (340,000 with final sentences in São Paulo) rather than widespread body cameras for officers, as these can inhibit rapid decision-making in combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:18">[02:32:18]</a>.
    *   Utilizing intelligence to identify high-risk crime points and increase ostensive policing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.
    *   Working with the federal government on intelligence and financial asphyxiation of [[organized_crime|organized crime]] networks, recognizing that seemingly small crimes like cell phone theft can be linked to larger criminal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:34">[02:21:34]</a>.
    *   Strengthening penal legislation through federal deputies from São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:06">[02:33:06]</a>.

## Overall Administrative Approach
The administrative approach emphasizes:
*   **Team Building**: Assembling highly technical and capable teams with freedom to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>.
*   **Four Pillars**: Focusing on asset transfers to private initiative, completing ongoing works, improving regulatory frameworks, and strengthening oversight and anti-[[government_corruption_and_public_administration_in_brazil|corruption]] mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging with the market, industries, and local communities to understand problems and build common work agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>.
*   **Long-term Vision**: Recognizing that many projects take years and require continuity across different administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.
*   **Addressing Inequality**: Acknowledging and actively working to address the significant social inequality present in São Paulo's communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

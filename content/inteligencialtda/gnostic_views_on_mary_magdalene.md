## Gnostic Views on Mary Magdalene

The Gnostics created a version of [[Christianity and redemption | Christianity]] that was more palatable to the Greco-Roman world, seeking to make it more mystical and acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This approach aimed to "gild the pill" of the original Christian message, presenting a "cute" and "cool" Jesus who stood up against oppression, rather than focusing on the cross and sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

### Core Beliefs of Gnosticism

Gnostics believed that Jesus had secret teachings understood only by an elite group of Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. The term "gnosis" (knowledge in Greek) refers to this secret knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. They sought to complete what traditional Gospels did not have, leading to the creation of several Apocryphal Gospels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

A fundamental aspect of Gnostic thought was the separation of the spiritual world (pleroma) from the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>. For them, the spiritual world was pure, while the flesh was perverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>. This meant that if someone from the spiritual world incarnated in the material world, they would become contaminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>. Therefore, they did not believe in the Incarnation of the Son of God as presented in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:58">[02:07:58]</a>. Instead, they believed that the "spirit of Christ" came into the mind of the man called Jesus, guiding him during miraculous acts (like multiplying loaves or casting out demons), but abandoning him when he showed human weakness (like asking for water or swearing) or was crucified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>.

### Mary Magdalene in Gnostic Gospels

The Gnostics prominently featured the "sacred feminine" in their beliefs, which was also explored by modern authors like Dan Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>. This emphasis paralleled pagan religions, which often praised women and sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16">[01:39:16]</a>.

To align with prevailing philosophical ideas like Stoicism, which emphasized restraining bodily passions, particularly sexual ones, the Gnostics needed to create a Christ figure who had a companion but was not sexually involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:15">[01:46:15]</a>. This led to the creation of a mystical companion for Jesus, who was identified as Mary Magdalene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>. She was seen not as an incarnation (a word Gnostics disliked) but as the feminine wisdom, Sophia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:32">[01:46:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:38">[01:46:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:18">[02:07:18]</a>. Some Gnostic movements even placed Sophia as the wife of God the Father (who generated Jesus) or as Jesus's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. This was seen as a "plagiarizing" of the pagan world's deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

Gnostic Gospels, such as the Gospel of Philip and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, never explicitly mention a real wedding between Jesus and Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a>. Modern interpretations, like those in Dan Brown's works, suggest a marriage or an erotic relationship, often citing a passage in the Gospel of Philip about Jesus kissing Mary on the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>. However, the text is incomplete ("his page is deleted") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>, and at the time, a kiss was a common Middle Eastern greeting, not necessarily erotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. Mary Magdalene was often positioned as a devoted student of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, and she was closer to him and more attentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.

In Gnostic thinking, Mary Magdalene's spirit was seen as a "great soul" that could learn all secret knowledge from Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. Her body, like all material bodies, was believed to imprison the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:13">[02:09:13]</a>. Jesus, in this view, helped her "remember" what she was before her spirit was contaminated by matter â€“ that she was wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.

### [[conspiracy_theories_about_mary_magdalene | Conspiracy Theories]] and Gnostic Influence

Some modern interpretations and [[conspiracy_theories_about_mary_magdalene | conspiracy theories]] attempt to use Gnostic ideas to portray Mary Magdalene as a protagonist of a "feminist flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>. They suggest that she was the beloved disciple, a rival to Peter, and that the church suppressed her true role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. These theories often lack academic basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a>. For example, a claimed "lost gospel" fragment written in Coptic that supposedly proved Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife was later discovered to be a 20th-century forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

The idea that Mary Magdalene was Jesus's wife or had children with him is a [[conspiracy_theories_about_mary_magdalene | conspiracy theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:55">[02:06:55]</a>. The silence of biblical texts on this matter, in fact, refutes the idea, as there would be no reason to hide such a significant detail in the Gospels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. Even during the time of Pope Gregory the Great (591 AD), when Mary Magdalene was mistakenly labeled a prostitute, dissenters and heretics did not claim she was Jesus's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:44">[02:03:44]</a>. This specific theory is a relatively modern construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a>.

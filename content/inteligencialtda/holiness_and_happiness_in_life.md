The concepts of holiness and happiness are presented as intrinsically linked, with genuine happiness stemming from a life dedicated to God and others, rather than self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Defining Happiness and Holiness

True happiness, according to Father Duarte Lara, is not merely a fleeting emotion but a state attained through [[Holiness | holiness]], which involves loving God and others above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:47">[02:49:47]</a>. This perspective challenges the modern world's selfish tendencies, which often lead to unhappiness, depression, and a sense of emptiness, despite material abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. In contrast, past generations, despite having less, found [[the_concept_of_happiness_and_its_relation_to_mental_wellbeing | joy]] by focusing on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

[[Holiness | Holiness]] is not about austerity or appearing somber; rather, it is accessible through everyday, honest activities that serve as opportunities to love God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. For instance, mundane tasks like doing dishes for the love of family and God can contribute to [[Holiness | sanctification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. The pursuit of [[Holiness | holiness]] is seen as a "lifestyle that attracts" others to God, serving as the most effective form of evangelization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

## Paths to Holiness and Happiness

Several practices are recommended for achieving [[Holiness | holiness]] and, by extension, [[the_concept_of_happiness_and_its_relation_to_mental_wellbeing | happiness]]:

*   **Confession** - Regular confession, ideally once a month, is described as "spiritual hygiene" that cleanses the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. It is free and has no contraindications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Mass and Communion** - Attending Mass regularly, even if for only half an hour, is considered a "spiritual Red Bull" that provides an "atomic bomb" of divine presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. Receiving communion well, after confession and spiritual preparation, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Praying the Rosary** - Our Lady of FÃ¡tima appeared six times, asking for the daily recitation of the rosary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Though repetitive, like daily routines, it is a way to feed love for God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The devil reportedly hates the rosary due to its great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:55">[02:48:55]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Companionship** - In Portugal, [[Spiritual Teachings and Beliefs | Catholic movements]] play a significant role in fostering a deeper relationship with God, similar to communities in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. These groups provide a supportive environment for [[Spirituality and Personal Growth | spiritual growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **Forgiveness** - Holding onto resentment and bad feelings prevents God's grace from entering the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. Forgiveness is a critical step in healing and drawing closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:15">[01:43:15]</a>.
*   **Joy and Love as Exorcistic Tools** - Joy is "exorcistic" and a "happy person" is one the devil dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>. Love, especially, is seen as powerful in driving away evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:09">[02:40:09]</a>.

## Obstacles to Happiness and Holiness

Conversely, selfish living leads to sadness and emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. The modern world's culture, with its focus on pleasure disconnected from true love and the transmission of life, is seen as destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>. Engagement with practices like divination, magic, and idolizing other spiritual forces opens doors to "extraordinary disturbances" from the devil, hindering [[the_concept_of_happiness_and_its_relation_to_mental_wellbeing | happiness]] and [[Holiness | spiritual well-being]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The text also touches on [[the_concept_of_happiness_and_its_relation_to_mental_wellbeing | mental wellbeing]] and physical health, noting that [[Importance of Mindfulness and Spirituality | self-care]] and temperance in habits (e.g., cell phone use, diet, sleep) are crucial for overall integrity and the ability to love God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:29">[03:00:29]</a>. Without minimum health, it becomes harder to practice [[Holiness | holiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:25">[03:02:25]</a>. The spiritual dimension of life implies an ongoing "spiritual struggle," the recognition of which is the first step to overcoming obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:34">[02:50:34]</a>.

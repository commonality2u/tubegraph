The biblical book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, is often misinterpreted as a dark and confusing text about the end of the world [01:26:24]. However, its true meaning, derived from the Greek word "apocalypses" (ἀποκάλυψις), is "that which came out of the shadows," "that which is clear," or "revealed" [01:02:02]. This book, written by the Apostle John, reveals things that were hidden, making them clear [01:03:52].

## Understanding Prophecy and Revelation

[[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | Biblical prophecies and eschatology]] can be understood through two main categories: classical prophecy and apocalyptic prophecy [01:19:03].

*   **Classical Prophecy:** Typically begins with "Thus says the Lord" and largely addresses present-day complaints, with the prophet directly confronting current issues, like Nathan denouncing King David or John the Baptist confronting Herod [01:18:25]. It is usually written in prose [01:19:09].
*   **Apocalyptic Prophecy:** Begins with "I saw and heard" and focuses more on future events [01:18:31]. It uses coded language, parables, and is often written in poetry, making it easier to memorize [01:19:03]. This style emerged around the sixth century BC, allowing prophets to denounce oppressive powers (like Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome) in a camouflaged manner, similar to songs during a dictatorship [01:19:13]. The Book of Daniel is an Old Testament example of apocalyptic literature [03:08:58].

The book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is not the last one written (the Gospel of John was written afterward by the same author, according to most theologians) [01:31:36]. God inspired John to write in an apocalyptic form, aiming to explain the entire narrative from the first to the last chapter in an understandable way [01:34:06].

### Interpretations of Revelation

There are at least four main [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | different interpretations of eschatology and end times]] regarding the book of Revelation:
*   **Preterist:** Believe that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled entirely in the first century AD, with no future implications [02:00:51]. Many Catholic theologians, for instance, interpreted the Beast of the Apocalypse as Nero and the Roman Empire [02:10:06].
*   **Futurist:** Hold that 90% of the Apocalypse's content refers to events of the future, specifically the [[end_times_and_revelations | end times and revelations]] [02:11:21].
*   **Historicist:** Interpret the Apocalypse as being fulfilled gradually throughout human history, from the time of Jesus until the end of time [02:13:36]. This perspective is defended by the speaker [02:13:36].
*   **Idealist:** View the Apocalypse as a timeless, symbolic parable, where all elements represent universal concepts or messages rather than specific historical or future events. For example, the Beast could represent any oppressive power [02:19:53].

Methods to understand the Apocalypse include:
*   **Self-interpretation:** The book itself provides explanations for its symbols (e.g., the "waters" where the "prostitute" sits are identified as "peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages" [02:22:53]).
*   **Context of the entire Bible:** Cross-referencing symbols with other parts of the Bible [02:23:56].
*   **Historical context:** Understanding what Christians of John's era would have understood by the text [02:24:08].

### Structure and Cycles

The Apocalypse does not tell a linear story but is structured in cycles, often repeating themes with added details. This chiastic (or palindromic) structure means that themes introduced early in the book reappear later, often in reverse order or with more specific information [03:10:11]. This was common in ancient literature, designed to aid memorization for audiences who primarily heard, rather than read, the texts [02:27:01].

Numbers in the Bible carry symbolic meaning:
*   **Four (4):** Represents universality, like "the four corners of the world" or "the four winds of heaven" [03:33:16].
*   **Seven (7):** Denotes perfection or completeness, as in the seven colors of the rainbow or the seven days of creation [03:40:50]. The Apocalypse is full of the number seven (seven churches, seven angels, etc.) [03:40:50].
*   **Twelve (12):** Symbolizes the people of God, often seen in the 12 tribes of Israel or the 12 apostles [01:10:23]. When numbers are multiplied (e.g., 70x7, 12x12x1000), it implies a superlative or perfect fulfillment [01:42:50].

## Key Visions and Prophecies

The book of Revelation is divided into several main sequences, each providing insights into the history of God's people and the ultimate [[end_times_and_signs_of_the_coming | End Times and Signs of the Coming]].

### The Seven Churches

John writes to seven churches in Asia Minor (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea) [03:31:50]. These seven churches are understood as representing the entire Church of God throughout different periods of history, from John's time until the return of Jesus [03:40:40].

*   **Laodicea:** The last of the seven churches, representing the final period of Christian history, believed to be the current era [03:46:07]. The message to Laodicea warns against spiritual lukewarmness, self-sufficiency, and a lack of true spiritual wealth, despite outward appearances of prosperity [04:29:08]. The church is described as "neither cold nor hot," causing Jesus to "vomit" it out [04:22:09]. This illustrates that spiritual indifference, or seeking a "middle ground" in matters of good and evil, is condemned [04:42:09]. Jesus, who walked among the seven lampstands (representing the churches), stands at the door knocking, indicating His imminent return [04:11:11].

### The Seven Seals

The vision shifts to the Throne of God, where a book sealed with seven seals is held [01:14:06]. This book is interpreted as an inheritance document, as ancient inheritance documents often had seven seals, each witnessed and sealed by different individuals [01:17:15]. John weeps because no one is found worthy to open the book, meaning no one has the dignity to be the heir [01:22:48]. However, Jesus, the "Lion of the tribe of Judah," is declared worthy to open the seals, having legally acquired the right to inherit the earth through His death on the cross [01:23:25].

As each of the first four seals is broken, a horseman appears:
*   **White Horse:** Traditionally interpreted as the triumphant spread of the Gospel [01:26:46].
*   **Red Horse:** Symbolizes war and bloodshed [01:26:08].
*   **Black Horse:** Represents famine and economic hardship [01:26:08].
*   **Pale Horse:** Represents death and disease (epidemics) [01:26:08].

These four horsemen parallel Jesus' prophecies in Matthew 24, which describe signs of His coming: the gospel preached to the world, wars, famines, and pestilences [01:27:36].

The **Sixth Seal** describes cosmic disturbances: a great earthquake, the sun turning black, the moon becoming blood-red, and stars falling from the sky [01:28:24]. These events are also mirrored in Matthew 24 and represent dramatic signs immediately preceding the return of Jesus [01:28:24]. The Seventh Seal signifies a solemn silence in heaven, indicating the time of final judgment [01:29:29].

### The 144,000 Sealed Ones

After the sixth seal, 144,000 individuals are sealed from all the tribes of Israel [01:35:59]. While some interpretations take this literally as Jews, the speaker interprets this number symbolically: 12 (God's people) multiplied by 12 (God's people), then by 1,000 (a superlative for a great multitude) [01:42:57]. These 144,000 represent God's faithful people throughout history—Jews and non-Jews—who remain firm in their faith and keep God's commandments [01:43:09]. The text in Revelation 14, describing them as "virgins" who are not "defiled with women," further reinforces a symbolic, not literal, interpretation, pointing to spiritual purity [01:41:00]. This group is also linked to the concept of "firstfruits" – those who are saved early, serving as a representative group for all the saved [01:13:01].

This group will pass through the "Great Tribulation" [01:39:04]. There are differing views on the timing of Jesus' return relative to this tribulation:
*   **Pre-Tribulationism:** Jesus returns *before* the tribulation to rapture the church, saving them from suffering [01:30:50].
*   **Mid-Tribulationism:** Jesus returns *in the midst* of the tribulation [01:44:40].
*   **Post-Tribulationism:** Jesus returns *after* the tribulation, meaning the church will endure it [01:48:53]. The speaker aligns with the post-tribulationist view [01:39:12].

### The Seven Trumpets

The seven trumpets represent God's warnings and judgments throughout history, paralleling the seven plagues [01:44:10]. They are God's "megaphone" to a "deafened world," manifesting as catastrophes and significant historical events [01:46:38]. These are not literal trumpets heard by all, but symbolic announcements of divine judgment and impending events [01:46:21].

### The Great Conflict: The Woman, The Dragon, and The Beast

Revelation 12-14 describes the central conflict between good and evil, specifically involving a "woman," a "dragon," and a "beast" [01:56:03].
*   **The Woman:** Dressed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of 12 stars [01:56:23]. She represents God's people throughout history, specifically giving birth to the Messiah (Jesus) [02:02:39]. Her suffering and labor pains symbolize the challenges God's people face.
*   **The Dragon:** Identified as the "ancient serpent," the devil, and Satan [02:10:56]. The dragon attempts to devour the child born to the woman (Jesus) but fails as the child is "raptured" to God's throne [02:03:50]. A war ensues in heaven, where Michael (whose name means "Who is like God?" – a rhetorical question challenging Satan's claims) and his angels defeat the dragon, casting him and his angels down to earth [02:11:10]. This parallels the Genesis account of the serpent and the promise of enmity between the serpent's offspring and the woman's descendant (Christ) [02:12:12].
*   **The Beast from the Sea:** After being cast to earth, the dragon (Satan) empowers a "beast" with "seven heads and ten horns," resembling a leopard, bear, and lion [02:16:11]. This beast is given authority to act for 42 months (equivalent to "a time, times, and half a time" or 3.5 years), the same period the woman (God's faithful church) flees to the desert for protection [02:27:35]. Historically, the beast has been interpreted as the Roman Empire and later the Papacy, representing a power that would persecute God's people and attempt to change God's law [02:49:09]. The catechism states that the antichrist is a religious deception arising from within Christianity, offering apparent solutions at the price of apostasy [02:57:00]. This beast makes an image of itself and compels people to worship it, a parallel to ancient idolatry such as the golden calf [03:04:02].
*   **The Harlot Woman on the Beast:** John is shown a woman riding the beast, described as a "great prostitute" adorned in purple and scarlet, "drunk with the blood of the saints" [03:22:01]. This harlot represents the apostate church, symbolized by a city (Rome, known for its seven hills) that dominates the kings of the earth [03:00:21]. This vision shows the faithful woman (God's true people) turning into a harlot through alliance with worldly power (Rome), signifying a great apostasy within Christianity [02:59:22].

### Endtimes Prophecies and Christ's Return

The Apocalypse culminates in three angelic messages calling humanity to fear God, give Him glory, worship the Creator, and warn against Babylon (the apostate system) and the "mark of the beast" [03:10:43]. This "mark" is seen as a parody of God's seal, which is symbolized by His commandments on the forehead and hand of His faithful followers [03:12:08].

Finally, Christ returns from heaven as a "Faithful and True" warrior, with eyes like fire, clad in a blood-soaked robe (representing the blood of divine wrath against evil) [03:14:18]. Satan is imprisoned for a millennium, followed by the creation of a New Heaven and a New Earth [03:15:06]. In this new creation, there will be no more sea (symbolizing separation), no more tears, death, mourning, crying, or pain, as God Himself will dwell with humanity, wiping away every tear [03:19:17]. This victorious end promises eternal life and reign with Christ for the faithful [03:20:06].

While the exact timing of these events remains a subject of [[interpretations_of_biblical_prophecy_and_the_end_times | interpretations of Biblical prophecy and the end times]], the present age shows movements that could indicate the proximity of these end times, such as global alliances and restrictions on buying and selling for those without the "mark of the beast" [03:41:00]. The Apocalypse serves as a divine warning and a promise of ultimate victory for those who remain faithful.

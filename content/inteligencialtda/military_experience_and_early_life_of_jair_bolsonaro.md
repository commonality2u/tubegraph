[[Jair Bolsonaros political career and presidency | Jair Bolsonaro]] was born in 1955 and was raised in New Ribeiro, close to Eldorado Paulista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Early Life and Childhood
Bolsonaro attended public school, which he described as "very good" during his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He noted that all his brothers arrived at school already literate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He has seven brothers in total, characteristic of the large families of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. His father had nine siblings and his mother six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

His childhood involved a "very healthy" life without modern comforts like cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Before television, people gathered around the radio to listen to programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. He often listened to the "Tuia Tunic Tinoco" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

His childhood was also characterized by playing in the street, often barefoot, engaging in activities like rollerblading, riding carts, and flying kites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. He mentions that children often took part-time jobs, such as shining shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Bolsonaro frequently fished in Eldorado Paulista, going about three days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, and rarely asked his parents for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

His father worked as a "practical dentist" who would pull teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, and also as a dental prosthetist, making dentures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The family lived in Eldorado Paulista for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Education and Early Ambitions
As a young person, Bolsonaro diligently studied in the public library using the *Bar√ßa Encyclopedia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. He learned English and improved his Portuguese through correspondence courses from the Universal Institute Brazilian (IUB), which helped him with grammar and finding synonyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>.

His primary interests in school were mathematics, physics, and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:23">[02:27:23]</a>. He excelled in academics, frequently appearing on the honor roll at his school in Eldorado Paulista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. He also delivered newspapers daily, assembling them himself, and would highlight his name when his crossword puzzles were published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

At 15, he "fell in love with the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He was the first military person in his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. He was drawn to the uniformed people in his city and successfully passed the entrance exams for military schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Military Career
Bolsonaro served a total of 15 years in the Brazilian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[02:21:55]</a>. During his time in the military, he was a good athlete, participating in sports such as basketball, football, and military pentathlon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The military pentathlon involved five tests: shooting, track, obstacle race, swimming, and an obstacle course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Upon finishing the academy, officers are declared "official aspirante" and typically progress to the rank of Colonel, which is "practically guaranteed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Beyond Colonel, the path to General is much more selective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

He gained significant experience on the border in Niak, Southern Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. His military file revealed he had an electricity course certificate, leading him to become the head of the plant, managing diesel motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This often involved spending weekends repairing the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

## Transition to Politics
Bolsonaro's entry into politics was unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. In 1986, he made a declaration to *Veja* magazine, which, as an active military man, resulted in disciplinary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:40">[02:52:40]</a>. This incident led to his public appearance and sparked his interest in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56">[02:55:56]</a>. He then ran as a councilor candidate in 1988 for the Democratic Christian Party (PDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This marked the beginning of his nearly three-decade career in [[Brazilian politics and governance | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:38">[02:57:38]</a>.

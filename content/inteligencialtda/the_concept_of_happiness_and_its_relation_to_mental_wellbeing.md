Happiness, a core aspect of [[holiness_and_happiness_in_life | mental wellbeing]], is described not merely as a feeling but as an active state and a continuous construction [01:45:00]. It is a verb that requires practice and learning [01:36:32].

## Defining Happiness and Joy

It is crucial to distinguish between happiness and joy:
*   **Joy** is a momentary emotion, a fleeting sensation of feeling good, often immediate and contagious [01:52:20]. An example could be the achievement of a championship [01:53:33].
*   **Happiness**, in contrast, is a deeper state and a continuous process of building [01:54:25].

## The Purpose of Life and Happiness

True happiness is achieved by fulfilling one's purpose [01:16:16]. While humans are born as animals, becoming a "human being" is a process of construction [01:27:28]. The purpose of a human being is to evolve [01:17:00]. When one identifies their mission and walks that path, they are in the process of being happy and generating what nature expects [01:17:04]. Nature does not support uselessness; things made with good intentions tend to be almost eternal, much like the pyramids of Egypt [01:19:19].

Human beings are unique among animals due to their [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | free will]] and the ability to reflect and think [01:18:30]. This enables them to choose their path [01:18:57]. Finding one's meaning in life is connected to the talents and gifts received, as illustrated by the biblical parable of the talents [01:19:04]. Cultivating these gifts and sharing them with others leads to "the glory of life" [02:12:12].

## The Importance of Sharing and Social Connection

Humans have a fundamental need to share and live together, a concept deeply embedded in their DNA [02:18:50]. This is evidenced by empathy, which allows individuals to connect with others [02:22:09]. The recent pandemic highlighted the detrimental effects of being prevented from sharing experiences [02:19:54], reinforcing that humans are social beings born to connect [02:22:01].

## Obstacles to Happiness and Wellbeing

Several factors can hinder the pursuit of happiness:

### Living in the Wrong Time
Happiness can only be experienced in the "here and now" [02:48:48]. People often fail to grasp this, constantly dwelling on the future or the past, losing sight of the present moment [02:49:50]. Children, who have no notion of time, embody this present-focused happiness [02:55:57]. Adults, particularly those aged 30-35, are often more anxious and compare themselves to others, which can be detrimental to their happiness [03:00:27].

### Materialism and Social Media
A significant obstacle to human connection and happiness is ostentation [02:40:04]. Society often values individuals based on the brands they use or their number of followers on social media [02:41:10]. This leads to a "mass movement" of people deceiving themselves and others by presenting a fabricated life [02:43:11]. This phenomenon is exacerbated by artificial intelligence in social networks, which creates echo chambers by feeding users only content that aligns with their perceived interests, fostering division [05:05:07].

### Addictions and Uncontrolled Desires
Happiness is impossible if one is "captured by his desires" [05:19:17]. Vices, defined as desires that spiral out of control, impede happiness [05:23:40]. Excessive alcohol consumption, for example, can deepen sadness rather than alleviate it, turning a celebration into an escape [05:51:02].

### Mental Health Disorders
Mental health conditions significantly impact the ability to experience happiness:
*   **Depression**: A person suffering from depression cannot be happy [05:30:52]. End-of-year depression is a common phenomenon, often linked to decreased sunlight (affecting vitamin D and serotonin production), excessive eating, and alcohol consumption during holiday periods [07:09:47].
*   **Anxiety**: Severe anxiety also precludes happiness [05:34:04]. High Beta brain waves are associated with excessive stress [05:26:06].
*   **Bipolar Disorder**: Characterized by extreme mood swings, from euphoria to depression, making sustained happiness difficult without proper treatment [05:51:02]. A significant challenge for bipolar individuals is recognizing when they are veering off track and maintaining self-awareness [05:58:51].
*   **Psychopathy**: Often linked to narcissism, psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by perversity and a lack of empathy, treating others as objects [01:42:17]. It is hereditary [01:59:54] and its most severe form is associated with serial killing [02:00:50].
*   **Borderline Personality Disorder**: In contrast to psychopathy, borderline individuals are highly emotional and dependent on others [03:04:41]. Their actions, even if destructive, often stem from desperation and a fear of abandonment, rather than malice [03:05:48].

### Societal and Parenting Challenges
Modern societal values, particularly individualism, instrumentalism (using others for personal gain), and relativism (believing everything is subjective), contribute to the rise of narcissistic and psychopathic behaviors [01:43:30]. This also impacts parenting, where parents, aiming to provide an easier life for their children, may inadvertently create fragile individuals by shielding them from challenges and preventing them from developing resilience [02:26:17]. The digital age, with its hyperstimulation, further compounds these issues [02:40:40].

## Cultivating Happiness

Despite obstacles, happiness can be cultivated through conscious effort:

*   **Living in the Present**: Recognizing that "the time of happiness is now" and fully engaging with the present moment is crucial [02:06:55].
*   **Self-Knowledge and Purpose**: Understanding oneself and one's mission or purpose in life is fundamental [01:04:04].
*   **Acceptance and Resilience**: Acknowledging that not everything can be controlled and that challenges will pass fosters resilience [03:24:34]. Learning from mistakes and embracing new ones is part of this growth [02:15:15].
*   **Spirituality (Non-Religious)**: Cultivating a sense of connection with something greater provides comfort and a belief that life transcends its temporary existence [03:39:00]. There is a specific region in the brain (frontal ventral) that, when activated, gives a feeling of connection to something greater, akin to exercising faith [03:57:55]. This spiritual connection is essential for happiness [03:53:55].
*   **Creating Memories**: Consciously observing and "qualifying" positive moments with sensory details (colors, sounds, tastes) helps in creating vivid memories that can be accessed later during difficult times [04:37:37].
*   **Physical Activity and Sleep**: Engaging in [[the_effects_of_physical_activity_on_mental_health | physical activity]] and ensuring sufficient sleep are vital for [[mental_health_disorders_and_treatments | mental wellbeing]] and counteracting conditions like bipolarity [03:37:07].
*   **Managing Expectations**: Children are naturally happier because they lack expectations [02:59:09]. Reducing expectations about life and future outcomes can contribute to greater contentment [03:09:10].
*   **Consciousness over Brain Function**: While the brain is a complex organ for survival and reproduction, consciousness is the "drone" that observes and commands it [04:47:03]. Conscious intervention allows humans to evolve beyond primitive programming and base life on values, virtues, and wise actions [04:55:00].

## Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Treatment

Suicide is a complex phenomenon driven by desperation, not altruism or attention-seeking [03:17:14]. Those who attempt suicide often believe there is no way out of their suffering [03:17:20]. Modern treatments for severe depression and suicidal thoughts include ketamine (a substance also used as an anesthetic) and neurofeedback, which stabilizes brain waves [03:08:51]. These advanced therapies, along with [[mental_health_disorders_and_treatments | traditional medication]], offer hope for those in despair [03:09:05]. It is also crucial to avoid romanticizing suicide, as it is a tragic act of desperation [03:20:11].

For managing mental health conditions, a genetic test called neuropharmaceuticals can help determine which medications will be most effective and which might cause adverse side effects [03:43:44]. This allows for more personalized and effective [[mental_health_disorders_and_treatments | treatment plans]]. The awareness of mental health issues has also increased [[mental_health_awareness_postpandemic | post-pandemic]] [03:41:00].

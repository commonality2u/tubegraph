This article explores various [[historical_and_biblical_perspectives | historical and biblical perspectives]] surrounding Jesus and early Christianity, drawing from spiritual revelations, ancient mythologies, and interpretations of religious texts.

## The Unknown Years of Jesus' Life
Between the ages of 14 and 30, there is no mention of Jesus in the Bible [00:05:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Speculation and spiritual revelations suggest he traveled to various places, including India [00:05:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. These accounts are not verifiable but are considered spiritual revelations that should be viewed with caution [00:06:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

During this period, Jesus's father, Joseph, worked for Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy Jewish citizen with Roman citizenship who traded tin and ores [00:12:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Joseph of Arimathea was also a scholar of mysteries, including those of Jewish and Greco-Roman cultures [00:12:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. He convinced Mary and James (Jesus's eldest brother) to allow Jesus to work as a manager for his caravans, traveling to various parts of the world [00:13:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This allowed Jesus to seek answers to questions no one could provide, potentially meeting the Magi [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

According to spiritual gossip, Jesus traveled from age 16-17 until 24-25, financed by Joseph of Arimathea, to places like Persia, India, and Egypt [00:14:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Mary, Jesus's mother, was a descendant of the Benj Gala Tribe from ancient Gaul (modern-day France) [00:15:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Her ancestors moved to Palestine, which is why the region is called Galilee [00:15:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The Jews of Judea considered those from Galilee and Samaria to be of mixed blood and not "first class" Jews [00:16:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Jesus in the Temple
The Bible mentions that when Jesus was about 9-11 years old, his family went to Jerusalem for a pilgrimage, a custom for Jewish families to visit Solomon's temple annually [00:08:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. On the way back, Mary and Joseph realized Jesus was not with them and returned to Jerusalem [00:08:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. After three days, they found him in the Sanhedrin, listening to and questioning the doctors of the law [00:09:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. When Mary admonished him, Jesus replied that he had come to take care of his father's interests [00:09:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Evolution of Early Christianity and Its Texts
In the 4th century, [[historical_context_of_early_christianity | Christianity]], which had been a persecuted religion, became the state religion of the Roman Empire under Emperor Constantine [00:06:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>). Constantine's mother, Helena, advised him to become a Christian [00:06:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>). This shift led to the selection and translation of Christian texts.

### Jerome and the Vulgate
Jerome, a polemicist from Alexandria, was hired by Damasus, the first Pope of the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]], to translate thousands of Gospels written in Aramaic and Greek into Latin [00:06:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>). This process involved sifting through approximately 4,000 available Gospels in the 4th century to decide which would be officially accepted by the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]] and what would be considered heresy or apocryphal [00:06:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>).

Jerome also removed the Book of Enoch from the Old Testament, reducing the Septuagint's 47 books to 46 [00:27:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>). The Book of Enoch was considered highly important because it announced that Yahweh would send his Messiah, making Jesus a character fulfilling Enoch's prophecy [00:27:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>). This removal aimed to dispel Jewish myths as Christianity became Italian [00:28:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>).

### Three "Faces" of Jesus
According to spiritual perception, there are three main "faces" of Jesus:
1.  **Jesus the Galilean:** After Jesus's death, the apostles, fearing persecution, gathered in Jerusalem and decided that Jesus's message was only for Jews [00:19:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>). They created a version of Jesus based on their knowledge of him [00:20:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>).
2.  **Jesus the Christ/Marvel Superstar:** The resurrected Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus (Paul), a persecutor of Christians, who then became Christian and began spreading Jesus's message to the rest of the world [00:20:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>). Paul created the figure of "Jesus the Christ," a term not used for Jesus during his lifetime [00:20:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>). Paul introduced concepts like salvation and justification by faith, which Jesus never taught, as Jesus stated that each person would be judged by their works [00:21:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>).
3.  **Jesus the Living One:** The resurrected Jesus also appeared to [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene]], who organized a group of disciples (not apostles) [00:21:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>). These disciples were Hellenic Jews, more culturally open than the largely illiterate Galilean apostles [00:22:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>). [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene]] and this group compiled dozens of important manuscripts in the 1st century, revealing Jesus as "the living one" (resurrected) [00:22:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>). The [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]] in the 4th century suppressed this figure and [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene's]] role [00:22:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>).

### The Gnostic Gospels and Their Suppression
The teachings given to [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene]] by the resurrected Jesus contained "strange things" that the Church preferred to silence [00:23:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>). Jesus stated that those who seek truth would find it and be "stunned," not joyous [00:23:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>). This "shocking revelation" pertained to the Biblical God, whom Jesus (in his resurrected state) called a "demiurge" (a term Plato created for a complicated creator) [00:24:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>). This concept aligns with Gnosticism, which means "true knowledge" [00:25:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>). Some Gnostics went further, calling the God of Israel (Yahweh) the "devil," a concept Jesus never endorsed [00:25:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>).

In 376 AD, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria issued a decree to destroy all Gnostic books [00:28:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>). Monks from the Monastery of St. Pachomius in Egypt, who were translating [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene's]] books from Greek to Coptic, hid them in caves to prevent their burning by the Roman Empire [00:28:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>). These texts, known as the Nag Hammadi library, were discovered in 1945 [00:29:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>).

### The Council of Nicaea and the Holy Trinity
In 325 AD, Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, bringing together bishops from over a hundred Christian churches to transform [[historical_context_of_early_christianity | Christianity]] into Catholicism [00:31:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>). Here, the myth of the [[theological_debates_on_the_nature_of_jesus_and_the_trinity | Holy Trinity]] was created to eliminate the human side of Jesus and the God of the Jews [00:31:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>). They declared Jesus equal to God, a "God created" figure, and added the Holy Spirit, which Jesus never explicitly mentioned as himself [00:31:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>). The Catholic dogma prioritizes the Church's interpretation of God's word over the literal Bible [00:38:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>).

## The Concept of Evil and the Devil
Mythologies, originating over 47,000 years ago with the emergence of rational human thought, universally speak of a "cosmic egg" or "singularity" from which reality emerged [00:41:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>). These myths suggest that the creator made a mistake during creation, resulting in a "fall" [00:43:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>). This fallen creator then reconstructed itself from its "rotten parts," leading to inherent flaws in creation [00:44:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>). Thus, evil, as perceived, stems from this unintentional mistake of the creator [00:45:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>).

Religions, particularly in the last 4,000 years, cancelled these mythological explanations [00:45:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>). They transformed the concept of the fallen creator into a myth of a perfect God, with humanity being the source of sin [00:49:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>). The concept of the devil, Lucifer, or Satan is described as an invention [00:50:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>). These beings exist, but not in the terms presented by religion; they are robotic entities that serve the creator [00:50:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>). The origin of the devil as a personification of evil is linked to the Templars.

### The Templars and Baphomet
The Knights Templar, emerging in the 11th-13th centuries, had three main objectives [01:01:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>):
1.  **Separate the historical Jesus from Judaism:** Being European nobles, they sought to remove Jesus from his Jewish roots, a process the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]] had already begun [01:01:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>). They searched for relics and manuscripts (including [[mary_magdalene__historical_and_theological_analysis | Mary Magdalene's]] books) to rescue the historical Jesus [01:02:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>).
2.  **Establish a banking system:** They lent money to kings without interest, providing an alternative to Jewish moneylenders [01:02:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>).
3.  **Create a unified Europe:** They aimed for safe passage and unity across the continent [01:03:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>).

The Vatican, fearing loss of power, conspired with Philip IV of France to suppress the Templars [01:03:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>). Some Templars performed rituals honoring "Chokmah," the "great head of wisdom" from Kabbalah [01:03:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>). This figure was later called "Baphomet" [01:05:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>). The Church declared Baphomet to be the devil, leading to the common imagery of the devil with horns [01:05:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>).

## [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus and His Role in Salvation]]
The speaker asserts that [[jesus_and_his_role_in_salvation | Jesus's role in salvation]] was misinterpreted by Paul, who introduced concepts of "salvation" and "justification by faith" [00:21:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>). Jesus's own words, "it would be given to each one according to his works," contradict this [00:21:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>). The idea of God sending his son as a lamb to pay for humanity's sins is questioned as illogical [00:37:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>).

### Jesus's Mission and Transfiguration
Jesus's public ministry had three phases:
1.  **Demonstrating Messiahship:** He sought to prove to the Jews he was the prophesied Messiah by clarifying the 613 Jewish prescriptions [01:07:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>).
2.  **Performing Miracles:** He used his "superpowers" to perform miracles, multiply loaves, and walk on water [01:08:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>). However, he resisted demands to free Jews from Roman rule and establish an earthly empire, stating his kingdom was "not of this world" [01:08:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>).
3.  **Transfiguration:** During his transfiguration on Mount Tabor, Jesus met with angels and other beings who urged him to use his superpowers for the prophesied violent Messiah role [01:09:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>). They warned him that if he did not change his attitude, he would be crucified, and his borrowed genome (from a being called "Rockman") would have to be returned [01:10:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>). Jesus's birth was a result of artificial insemination of Rockman's genome into Mary [01:12:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>). During the transfiguration, Jesus became like the angels and spoke in "Capela language," asserting the dignity of his human self [01:13:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>). After this, he began telling his apostles he would die and resurrect in three days [01:13:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>).

### Journey to Hell and the Second Coming
According to the Gnostic Gospel of Bartholomew, found in Nag Hammadi, Jesus, after his apparent death on the cross, descended 500 steps into hell [01:18:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>). He went there to release the souls of humans, which had been imprisoned by figures like Hades and Belial since the time of Adam [01:19:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>). His sacrifice freed these souls from being trapped by "archons" of different heavens [01:20:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>).

[[jesus_and_his_role_in_salvation | Jesus's second coming]] will not be in a human body but in his "glorious form" as Rockman, surrounded by angelic hosts [01:14:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>). He will not be born of a virgin or subject to human stupidity again [01:15:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>).

## Other Related Concepts
*   **Reincarnation and Karma:** The speaker explains reincarnation as a cycle driven by unresolved "files" (negative pulses or attachments) in the lower quaternary (emotional, mental, and etheric bodies) that attach to the spirit [02:13:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>). To resolve these, new bodies are produced through "incarnational programming," implying human generation is a "brutal, selfish" act rather than love [02:15:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:55">[02:15:55]</a>). Free will exists in how one faces predetermined challenges [02:16:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>).
*   **The Nature of Angels and Gods:** The terms "angel" and "God" are often misused [01:28:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>). Angels are described as robotic beings or "clones" of Yahweh, obeying his orders without individual will [01:32:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>). The concept of demons (daiva) arose when a clone attacked Yahweh, its spirit transforming into a new being [01:32:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>). Ancient mythologies distinguish between "metamorphosing" (extra-physical) gods and "biological" beings (like the Nefel/Anunnaki aliens who came to Earth 450,000 years ago) [01:22:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>).
*   **Ancient Structures and Alien Influence:** Megalithic structures like the Giza pyramids and the Angkor Wat Temple match specific star constellations (Orion's Belt, Draco) from approximately 12,450 years ago [02:42:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:48">[02:42:48]</a>). This suggests non-human beings influenced their construction, leaving messages for future generations [02:45:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:51">[02:45:51]</a>). The Dogon people's knowledge of the Sirius star system (Sirius A, B, and C) predated its telescopic discovery, claiming their ancestors came from a planet orbiting Sirius C [02:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>). This indicates a "tremendously real" alien influence [02:50:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>).

[[Public fascination with true crime | Public fascination with true crime]] often stems from dramatized television shows like *CSI*, which portray rapid resolutions with high-tech equipment, often providing results in 24 to 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. However, the reality of [[Crime Scene Investigation | crime scene investigation]] and [[Forensic investigation techniques | forensic investigation processes]] in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, is quite different, often facing [[Challenges in Criminal Investigations | challenges in criminal investigations]] such as a lack of human resources and equipment, leading to delays of months for some exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

In Brazil, the sheer volume of cases means experts handle significantly more incidents in a week than some countries might see in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, Brazilian forensic experts aim to provide comprehensive and objective evidence, crucial for the conviction or acquittal of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Case Studies

### The "Walled Up" Woman Case

This case involved a missing woman whose husband had reported her disappearance. Investigators became suspicious when phone antenna data showed she had not left the region, contradicting the husband's claim she went to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

-   **Investigation:**
    -   A luminol test was conducted at the couple's home with the husband's authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
    -   Luminol reacted to a significant bloodstain on the floor in the living room, indicating a drag mark and attempts at cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
    -   Confronted with the evidence, the husband confessed to killing his wife, stating it was due to jealousy amid their separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
    -   He revealed he had walled her body up in a small, unused space under the stairs of their house, behind a children's bookshelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
    -   The body was found by firefighters breaking through the wall, in an advanced state of decomposition after about 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. The victim's hair had detached from her head due to the decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

### The Autistic Child Murder (Raísa)

This was a particularly difficult and saddening case for investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

-   **Discovery:** A GCM (Municipal Civil Guard) was notified by a 12-year-old boy about a dead woman in a park. Upon arrival, officers discovered it was a child's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
-   **Initial Report:** The initial report mistakenly stated it was a suicide of a woman hanging from a tree, but upon arrival, officers found a child's body in incomplete suspension, stuck to the tree trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
-   **Investigation:**
    -   The 12-year-old boy who reported the body was initially considered a witness but later confessed to the murder. His story, however, changed multiple times during the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
    -   Evidence, including blood on his shirt and his DNA on a sock used to tie the victim, contradicted his varying confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
    -   Footage showed him walking with the girl in the park. His cold demeanor, even sucking a lollipop while looking at the corpse, hinted at psychopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
    -   Autopsy revealed multiple injuries on the autistic girl's legs, likely inflicted with a "bada de ponta" (a type of stick), indicating torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. The fact she was autistic and couldn't defend herself made the case particularly horrific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.
    -   The boy had a history of over 85 occurrences of violence against the girl registered with the Guardianship Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
    -   The investigation team received praise from the Public Ministry for their dedication, working beyond regular hours to conduct exams and coordinate with medical and psychological professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

### The Elise Matsunaga Case

This [[Notable Crime Cases and Investigations | notable crime case]] gained significant media attention, including a dramatized series.

-   **Discovery:** The case began as a missing person report for Marcos Matsunaga, filed by his wife, Elise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>. Surveillance footage showed Matsunaga entering their apartment building but never leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:13">[01:56:13]</a>.
-   **Investigation:**
    -   Body parts (leg and arm) were later found in Cotia, and later, the head of an oriental male was found, confirming it was Marcos Matsunaga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>.
    -   Luminol tests were conducted throughout their large apartment (a duplex with six suites), starting at 8 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>. While the bathtubs showed no reaction, a new mattress in a bedroom unexpectedly fluoresced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>. This was later determined to be a false positive from the mattress's material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a>.
    -   The day after the initial luminol search (Wednesday morning), Elise confessed. She claimed to have shot her husband during an argument, then dismembered his body in a downstairs suite, placed the pieces in suitcases, and dumped them in Cotia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:12">[02:02:12]</a>.
    -   The reconstruction of the crime revealed inconsistencies in her narrative, particularly regarding the distance of the gunshot. Her claim of a 1.5-meter distance was incompatible with the wound's characteristics, which suggested a closer shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:41">[02:06:41]</a>.
    -   Forensic evidence confirmed her actions, including blood in the apartment and on cleaning cloths, and her disposal of the body parts and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>. It was also discovered she changed the barrel of the gun used in the murder to obscure ballistics evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:09">[02:05:09]</a>.
    -   Experts performed a reconstruction to test her physical capacity to move and dispose of the body parts alone, filling bags with equivalent weight. This revealed challenges with her version of events, suggesting external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:46">[02:15:46]</a>.
-   **Controversy:** The TV series was criticized for glamorizing Elise and portraying her as a victim, ignoring her calculated actions and the brutal nature of the crime, including sending fake emails from the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>. The perception that a victim's background (e.g., former prostitute) justifies or mitigates the crime was strongly rejected by the experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.

### Pessini Family Case (PM Couple)

This controversial case from 2013 involved a 13-year-old boy who killed his parents (both military police officers), grandmother, and great-aunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:30">[02:34:30]</a>.

-   **Controversy:** The case remains controversial due to attempts to discredit the findings by those with "twisted information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:12">[02:33:12]</a>. While residue tests on the boy's hand were negative, a glove found in the car he drove was overlooked in public discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:26">[02:33:26]</a>.
-   **Expert Opinion:** Experts involved trust the forensic findings, emphasizing that objective evidence, such as the significant time difference in the victims' deaths (over 16 hours between the adults and the boy), contradicted the boy's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:39">[02:40:39]</a>. This means the family died on Sunday night, yet the boy attended school on Monday morning, implying someone else executed the family and sent him to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>.
-   **Media Influence:** The press often provided misleading information, portraying the boy ("Marcelinho") as a normal 14-year-old and omitting details like his room being riddled with lead from shooting Nerf guns at cats and neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:43">[02:39:43]</a>.

### Suicide Cases with Written Notes

Experts often encounter suicides with unique and sometimes humorous last notes:

-   **Insurance Scheme:** A man who died from an abdomen shot left a note instructing loved ones to tear it up and claim it was a robbery, likely for insurance purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:18">[02:55:18]</a>. The note also explicitly asked that the police *not* be called first, indicating a desire to avoid an official investigation that might uncover the suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:07">[02:59:07]</a>.
-   **Corinthians vs. Palmeiras:** Another man, a Palmeiras fan, dressed in his team's outfit and left a note stating his Corinthians-fan friends would say "one less Palmeiras fan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:37">[03:06:37]</a>.
-   **"Tired of Living":** A man who lived alone in a hoarder's house left notes throughout, marking dates of deceased family members and his own planned death date. His final note stated he was "not sad, not unhappy, just tired of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

### Funk Dance Massacre (Paraisópolis)

This case involved the deaths of nine individuals at a funk dance in Paraisópolis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

-   **Investigation:** The case spanned over a year and three months of investigation, focusing on legal liability during a police action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The delegate overseeing the case was highly committed, studying extensively to understand the legal implications of police involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Tragically, this delegate suffered a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest after the case concluded, with his family stating he hadn't been sleeping due to his dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>.

### Celso Daniel Reconstruction

This was one of the longest single-day reconstructions for an expert.

-   **Investigation:** The reconstruction of the Celso Daniel case began at 9:30-10:00 AM and concluded at 6:00 AM the next day, resulting in extreme fatigue for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:47">[03:10:47]</a>.

### Walled Up Bodies in Alba Favela

A disturbing discovery was made in the Alba favela, where a house contained seven walled-up bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. Investigators found a new body every hour, extending the service for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:01">[03:12:01]</a>.

### Bingo Double Homicide

This case involved a double homicide at a bingo hall that nearly became a triple homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:23">[03:22:23]</a>.

-   **Investigation:**
    -   Surveillance footage showed the shooter, identified by distinctive, "ridiculous" footwear, which became a key element for investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:19">[03:23:19]</a>.
    -   The assailant destroyed the glass entrance door, filling the floor with glass fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:03">[03:24:03]</a>.
    -   A bleeding victim walked through the glass and blood, leaving traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:19">[03:24:19]</a>.
    -   A suspect was identified and found wearing the same distinctive shoes. Luminol applied to the shoe's sole glowed, indicating the presence of blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
    -   Analysis of the footwear also found microscopic glass fragments (1-2mm) typical of fractured glass, and an electron microscope confirmed the material's composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:27">[03:26:27]</a>.
    -   DNA analysis confirmed the blood on the shoe belonged to the deceased woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.
    -   This evidence, combined with footage and the suspect's recognition by the victim's wife, solidified the case, demonstrating the Locard's Exchange Principle ("every contact leaves a trace") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:51">[03:21:51]</a>.

## Conclusion on True Crime Investigations

Despite facing significant [[Challenges in Criminal Investigations | challenges in criminal investigations]] related to human resources and budget, forensic experts in São Paulo achieve commendable results. The reality of [[Forensic investigation processes | forensic investigation processes]] is complex, demanding patience, detailed scientific analysis, and collaboration, often contrasting sharply with the expedited timelines seen in popular true crime media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The goal remains to bring a sense of justice to victims' families by thoroughly investigating the facts and finding the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

The concept of a [[Technological Advancements and Global Control | New World Order]] (NWO) posits a future global government, single currency, and single religion, suggesting this will not happen overnight but rather through centuries of planned work by involved elites and secret societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:07">[08:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:21">[08:20:21]</a>. This agenda involves "pulling the little strings" of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:30">[08:54:30]</a> across all sectors, including the financial system, to orchestrate a global collapse from which an antichrist figure would emerge as humanity's savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:40">[08:31:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:36">[08:42:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:03">[08:44:03]</a>.

## Origins and Key Figures

The foundation for this [[Speculations on government coverups and conspiracies | conspiracy theory]] is drawn from a former Satanist named Doc Marx, author of "The Secret of the Illuminati" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. According to Marx, on January 22, 1870, Albert Pike, a prominent Freemason and author of "Morals and Dogma," received a vision from his spirit guides revealing how the NWO should be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:18">[07:42:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:23">[07:50:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:54">[08:00:54]</a>. This vision, shared with the highest echelons of his group, outlined a long-term plan to bring forth the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:46">[08:57:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:21">[09:06:21]</a>.

## The Three World Wars Prophecy

The establishment of the NWO is said to require three global wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:43">[09:33:43]</a>, far exceeding any previous conflicts in scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:48">[09:40:48]</a>. This process follows a Hegelian dialectic of thesis battling antithesis to produce a synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:04">[09:57:04]</a>.

### First World War (WWI) and Communism

The First World War aimed to overthrow the Russian Tsarist government, specifically because the Tsar opposed a Central Bank, a key objective of the global elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:17">[10:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:07">[10:41:07]</a>. The vision predicted a new Russian nation that would be militaristic, atheist, and communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:02">[10:54:02]</a>. Lenin, for instance, received financial support from the world's banking elite for the communist revolution, which would remove the Tsar and facilitate their financial system changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:26">[11:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:40">[11:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:09">[11:50:09]</a>.

### Second World War (WWII) and Soviet Power

The Second World War's purpose was to strengthen the newly formed communist nation and transform it into a superpower capable of destroying other nations and religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:02">[12:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:44">[12:32:44]</a>. The Soviet Union's actions, including the persecution of all religions (Christian, Jewish, Orthodox), aligning with the prophecy, as communism's premise is atheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:27">[13:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:56">[13:56:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:44">[14:23:44]</a>. The rise of the Soviet Union as a superpower post-WWII created the "antithesis" to Western capitalism, leading to the Cold War and global polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:19">[14:39:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:41">[14:52:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:37">[15:07:37]</a>. This division and conflict serve to distract people from a larger plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:09">[15:38:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

### Third World War (WWIII) and the Antichrist's Rise

The predicted Third World War, according to Albert Pike's vision, would start between Jews and Arabs (specifically Islam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:12">[16:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:09">[16:28:09]</a>. This prophecy was made in 1870, long before Israel became a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:02">[16:54:02]</a>. The current Israel-Hamas conflict is seen as drawing the "scenery on the horizon" for this war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:22">[17:28:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:17">[17:30:17]</a>. This conflict is driven by extremist groups who do not want peace and aim to destroy Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.

The danger is the escalation of the conflict, potentially involving Lebanon, and crucially, Iran and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:40">[20:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. Iran is believed to finance these terrorist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. A direct conflict between the US and Iran could involve Russia, as Iran is under Russia's military care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:40">[21:43:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:50">[21:52:50]</a>. This situation is considered a trigger for a global war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

Out of the chaos and ashes of this third war, a "super man" or leader, formed by these elites, would emerge to offer economic and social solutions, bringing peace and ending the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. This figure is interpreted as the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:12">[16:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:12">[17:12:12]</a>. He is expected to be Jewish and from a Jewish lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, who Israel will initially accept as the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Societal Transformation

The NWO agenda requires a gradual degradation of morals and an increase in "iniquity" (disrespect for order, rebellion against God's law, atheism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:27">[01:54:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This is seen as necessary for an anti-Christian new world order to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>.

### Revolution of 1968 and Counterculture

The "Revolution of 1968," though without globalism or the internet, was a decisive moment for cultural transformation and a rupture with Western spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. It began with protests against the Vietnam War and the "Prague Spring," which applied a "Menshevik" (cultural) socialist revolution by infiltrating institutions rather than outright destroying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>.

The counterculture movement, exemplified by Woodstock in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a>, promoted the "Age of Aquarius" as a new era replacing Christian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This movement influenced young people through drug use (LSD, heroin), music (rock and roll), and the arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:16">[02:03:16]</a>. Influencers like Harvard professor Timothy Leary popularized drug use as a way to "expand the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:12">[02:04:12]</a>. The sexual revolution, promoted by psychiatrists like Herbert Marcuse, linked sexual repression to war and pushed for "free sex" as a way to avoid conflict, leading to moral degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:17">[02:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:28">[02:05:28]</a>.

### Influence of Marxism and Music

Herbert Marcuse, a member of the Frankfurt School, sought to destroy Western culture and its religious dimensions by attacking capitalism and traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:55">[02:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. He adapted Marxism to influence Western culture through art, cinema, music, theater, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:27">[02:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:33">[02:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:46">[02:06:46]</a>. Marcuse is credited with implanting communism in the United States by identifying students, artists, and intellectuals as "outsiders" who would transform society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:58">[02:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>.

Music bands like The Beatles, influenced by the Beat Generation, played a significant role in this cultural revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:30">[02:12:30]</a>. John Lennon's song "Imagine" is cited as describing the NWO with themes of no borders or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>. The punk movement also expressed pessimism, revolt, and hate against bourgeois and capitalist values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05">[02:17:05]</a>. Songs like Dead Kennedys' "Holiday in Cambodia" and punk songs about Santa Claus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:51">[02:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a> introduced anti-capitalist and rebellious ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:29">[02:19:29]</a>. This cultural shift undermined traditional family values and led to a "horrific number of families destroyed by divorces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.

## Elite Control and Predictive Programming

The elites, including the Illuminati and certain families, are believed to be behind the scenes, pulling strings to control global systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. They control finance (Rothschild family, associated with a "red shield" and Satanic symbols), media, and education to shape global thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>.

### Predictive Programming

**Predictive programming** is a concept within [[conspiracy theories involving possible alien involvement | conspiracy theories]] that suggests the media, including films, TV shows, and music, is used to subtly introduce and normalize future events or societal changes into the collective subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

Examples cited include:
*   **Thanos in "Avengers":** The character's goal of reaping half of all living beings is seen as a subtle introduction to the NWO's agenda of world population reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:31">[02:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:38">[02:09:38]</a>. Bill Gates is mentioned as someone who has publicly stated the need for population reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.
*   **"The Simpsons":** The show's apparent "predictions" of future events are interpreted not as genuine foresight, but as evidence of an agenda being orchestrated by those in control, who then use the show to signal their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:52">[02:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.

### UN Agenda 2030

The UN, originally created to prevent conflicts, has allegedly expanded its influence to determine how nations should live, acting as a precursor to a unified world government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:35">[02:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:52">[02:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:33">[02:34:33]</a>. The UN 2030 Agenda is seen as part of this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:18">[02:33:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:52">[02:33:52]</a>.

### Catastrophes and Population Control

Doc Marx's predictions also include a series of scheduled catastrophes to coincide with the beginning of World War III, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, nuclear war (e.g., between Koreas), famine, and epidemics/pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. These are believed to be manipulated using weather technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

The rise of abortion, facilitated by some countries, is seen as a way to shed "innocent blood," which is considered a "currency" in the spiritual realm, strengthening the anti-God "Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This is part of the broader spiritual warfare.

## Spiritual Dimension

The NWO agenda has a strong spiritual dimension, involving [[paranormal soldiers and occultism in World War II | occultism]] and worship of spirits.

### Ancient Luciferian Cults

Ancient Luciferian cults are said to precede the biblical flood, evidenced by prediluvian pyramids with all-seeing eye symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. These cults aimed to "recover 100% intelligence" lost by humanity after the fall through occult practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. This worship involves bloodshed and human sacrifice, as blood is seen as a spiritual currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

After the flood, Nimrod, Noah's great-grandson, resurrected Luciferian cults and founded Babylon, considered the cradle of religions and idolatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:40">[02:30:40]</a>. Babylon was associated with sun and moon worship, exemplified by Nimrod and Semiramis, and later spread as the "cult of the son and the mother" to other nations like Egypt (Isis and Osiris) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[03:00:26]</a>. Mithraism, a Roman sun worship cult, was also associated with this lineage, influencing figures like Emperor Constantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:43">[02:31:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>. Secret societies today continue to display symbols like the "all-seeing eye" and solar imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[03:00:26]</a>.

### The Edomite/Idumean Lineage and "Synagogue of Satan"

A key element of this [[conspiracy theories about Mary Magdalene | conspiracy theory]] ties the Illuminati to the biblical figure Esau (also known as Edom), who was "hated" by God before birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:48">[02:38:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:09">[02:40:09]</a>. Esau's descendants, the Edomites, were known for their worship of chaotic deities and practices involving child sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:05">[02:47:05]</a>. Historically, the Edomites became known as Idumeans in the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:11">[02:50:11]</a>.

According to this theory, the Edomites were forcibly converted to Judaism by John Hyrcanus around 100-130 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:24">[02:49:24]</a>. This conversion was a "disguise," allowing them to infiltrate and gain positions of influence within Jewish government and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:02">[02:50:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:37">[02:50:37]</a>. King Herod, who ordered the killing of infants when Jesus was born, was an Edomite descendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:24">[02:50:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:44">[02:50:44]</a>. The Pharisees who opposed Jesus are also said to be converted Edomites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

This leads to the concept of the "Synagogue of Satan" from Revelation, referring to those who "say they are Jews, but are not," and are actually Satan worshippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:48">[02:53:48]</a>.

The Illuminati are said to have originated from Sabbatianism, founded by Rabbi Sabbatai Zevi in 1626, who claimed to be the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:21">[02:54:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>. This sect reversed traditional values, claiming God was evil and Lucifer was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>, and that biblical commandments, including laws on sexual relationships, were no longer mandatory, permitting all "sins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:08">[02:55:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>. One hundred years later, Jacob Frank founded Francoism, an underground sect that publicly followed Jewish law but secretly rejected it and practiced forbidden sexual acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:13">[02:56:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:21">[02:56:21]</a>. Six years after Francoism, Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati, with Sabbatarians and Francoists becoming its followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:45">[02:56:45]</a>. They believe Sabbatai's soul transmigrated to the "dynasty of the 13 families" who control the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:06">[02:57:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:11">[02:57:11]</a>. These "false Jews" are thus believed to be in control of global power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:52">[03:00:52]</a>.

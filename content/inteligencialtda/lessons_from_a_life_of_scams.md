Marcelo, known for a life "full of adventures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, recounts his [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | experiences]] with scams, crime, and eventual transformation. He was arrested for 11 years and nine months and escaped nine times during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Early Life and First Steps into Deception
Born in Maringá, Paraná, and raised in Curitiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, Marcelo's childhood dream was to become a pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. He frequented an aeroclub near his home, making friends and even participating in instruction flights, learning by observation and playing flight simulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

His father passed away when he was around 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. By age 16 or 17, he began traveling Brazil, running away from home, which marked the beginning of his "life of adventures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He often traveled for free by claiming to be the nephew of a bus company owner, staying in company accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This tactic worked easily due to the lack of technology for verification at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. He emphasized that "everyone lies a little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, noting he once told his wife he was ten years younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Impersonations and Scams
Marcelo impersonated various individuals to gain access or money:
*   **Son of the owner of Gol Airlines**: This was his most famous scam, gaining him VIP access and privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Drummer of Nenhum de Nós**: To enter a beach party in Santa Catarina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Guitarist from Engenheiros do Hawaii**: He contacted the Secretary of Culture in Balneário Camboriú, claiming to be the band's production, and was given a penthouse at Hotel Japão, which he then "sold" to three different people without ever paying for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Technical observer for the national soccer team**: To escape police at a hotel in Curitiba, he joined a soccer team's bus, wearing a full uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Operational delegate for the summer operation**: He used an old Ministry of Aeronautics card to free a friend from police in Paraná <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

## Life as a Pilot for a Cartel
Marcelo's involvement as a pilot began in Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Already a fugitive from the army, he met people involved in contraband flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>. He started flying "cases," which involved crossing the border from Paraguay to Brazil with contraband, often with drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. He diversified runways, operations, and schedules, becoming "indispensable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. He took a proper pilot course in Paraguay under a false name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

He performed "Kamikaze flights" to Colombia, which involved flying for many hours over the jungle with just enough fuel to reach a remote runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. These flights relied on a contact, "Uncle Iridium," who would call via satellite phone to give a two-hour window to cross the border, based on when US radar planes would refuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Runways were marked by oil barrels that were lit upon arrival and turned off upon departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. He lost friends due to these dangerous conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

## Prison and Escapes
Marcelo was first arrested in Balneário Camboriú for ideological falsehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, serving four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. He used various forged identities and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. His "Gol" scam eventually led to his arrest when federal police recognized him at an airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. He destroyed his fake IDs in the bathroom during the arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

He escaped nine times, sometimes before being judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He would observe daily routines and weaknesses in the prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. His reputation as "Ferrari" and connections to cartel leaders made him indispensable, meaning they couldn't leave him arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. Escapes were his "specialties," and he was considered "highly dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

Marcelo was the spokesperson for a rebellion in Bangu prison, representing two factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This role was attributed to him by the press, making him seem like a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

## Transformation and Lessons Learned
Marcelo says he learned to be afraid *after* having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. He has three children: Enzo (22), Vitória (21), and Davi (6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. The birth of his youngest made him realize that "that little person needs you" and depends solely on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

His decision to stop and change his life was the most difficult part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He now works in lectures and consulting, specifically in combating fraud, teaching banks how to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>. He uses his past experience to help others avoid scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. He also co-authored a book with Mariana Caltabiano, which was later adapted into the documentary "VIPS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Marcelo warns that fraud is "much easier" today due to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. His key advice to avoid scams is "when the alms are too much, the saint is suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. He emphasizes that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.

He acknowledges that his actions were "totally wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a> but notes that once he started, there was a point of no return, describing it as a "snowball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. He decided to "serve my sentence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a> and live a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. He states that he changed his "attitude" but didn't stop being Marcelo, using his intelligence for "lawful things" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. His children are aware of his past and understand the consequences of choosing the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

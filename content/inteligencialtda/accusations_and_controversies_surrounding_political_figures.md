He was accused of hiding Queiroz, who was reportedly wanted by the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

His supporters often referred to him as "the Myth" due to his culturally significant phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

During his term, Bolsonaro's administration was criticized for its handling of armament policies, with critics suggesting that his Provisional Measures and decrees were easily overturned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. He was accused of imposing a coalition with a left-wing party in Santa Catarina while with the PSL in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. A significant accusation against him is that he "put the [[political_debate_on_brazilian_politics | PT]] back in power" through his actions, inactions, and betrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>.

Concerns were also raised about his perceived support for a "sanitary dictatorship," particularly concerning compulsory vaccination, as he sanctioned a law that would force people to take vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>. He faced criticism for allegedly destroying the "School Without Party" initiative and not engaging with its proponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>.

### Lula
Lula, another prominent political figure, is frequently mentioned in contrast to Bolsonaro. He is referred to as a "corrupt thief president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, an "antichrist of the far left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, and is associated with "corruption scandals" like the "Mensalão" and "Petrolão" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. His government is linked to the "hunger of the people" and a struggling economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. His release from prison was a point of contention, with some claiming it was enabled by Bolsonaro's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. Lula's supposed alliance with a "new anti-world order" and "globalist" figures, receiving commendations from a "Duke of Hot," was also alleged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>.

### Danilo Gentili
[[Media coverage and controversies involving Danilo Gentili | Danilo Gentili]] faced legal challenges and persecution for a comedy film that some interpreted as offensive to Christian morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Although his film was fictional, it was deemed to be in "extreme bad taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

### Kim Kataguiri
[[Public perceptions and controversies | Kim Kataguiri]], a figure associated with the [[public_perceptions_and_controversies | MBL]] (Free Brazil Movement), is accused of ideological inconsistencies. He is described as pretending to be libertarian while approving censorship and the fake news law, allegedly aligning with the [[political_debate_on_brazilian_politics | PT]] to combat Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. It was suggested he would receive 8 years in prison for speaking ill of a politician if his proposed laws were enacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

### Roberto Jefferson
Roberto Jefferson, affiliated with the PTB, is labeled as a "criminal bum," a "bandit," and a "shameless person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

Olavo de Carvalho is cited as a key reference for some political views, particularly regarding the Forum of São Paulo and its alleged long-term plan to take power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>. His work is mentioned in discussions about political strategies and the nature of the Brazilian political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>.

### Hugo Chavez
Hugo Chavez is mentioned in a historical context related to [[discussion_on_political_ideologies_and_critiques | political ideologies and critiques]]. His actions in expanding the Supreme Court in Venezuela were compared to Bolsonaro's alleged desire to increase the number of justices in the Supreme Federal Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The consolidation of the Venezuelan dictatorship is attributed to segments of the opposition boycotting the electoral process, leading to the Chavistas winning the congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:53:08">[02:53:08]</a>.

### Other Political Figures
*   **Zé Dirceu:** Stated in 2019 that "we will take power," implying a plan beyond just winning elections, through means other than electoral victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:04:52">[03:04:52]</a>.

## Broader Controversies

### [[Brazilian political debates | Brazilian Political Debates]]
The discussion often revolves around the perceived "rotten" nature of the [[brazilian_political_debates | Brazilian political system]], which is seen as "putrid" and beyond belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. The argument is made that all politicians, once in power, prioritize self-benefit and forget campaign promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

### Electoral Fund and Funding
The electoral fund is viewed as immoral, a "theft" of public money used to institutionalize the "purchase of Parliament by the executive" and to perpetuate those already in power, making it difficult for new blood to enter [[Political Interaction and Public Figures | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. Some argue that taking money from the electoral fund, despite its perceived immorality, is a necessary "doping" to fight against the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

### [[highprofile_court_cases_and_judicial_proceedings | Judiciary and Rule of Law]]
There's a strong critique of [[highprofile_court_cases_and_judicial_proceedings | judicial activism]] in Brazil, particularly concerning the Supreme Federal Court (STF), which is accused of overstepping its jurisdiction and influencing political appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. The Judiciary is also criticized for alleged "double standards" in applying the law, specifically by prosecuting some for speech while allowing others to advocate for armed revolution or similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>. The concept of an "unjust law is not a law" is brought up, echoing Saint Augustine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:44:37">[01:44:37]</a>.

### Freedom of Speech and Censorship
Debates frequently touch upon the limits of freedom of expression. Some argue that while opinions can be freely expressed, claiming certain factual outcomes (like election fraud) without proof, or inciting crime, crosses the line into illegal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:39:49">[01:39:49]</a>. The concern exists that some are "demonizing" dissent by framing it as inciting violence or supporting totalitarian ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

### [[Policies and controversies during Bolsonaros term | Ideological Consistency]]
Accusations of ideological inconsistency are common, such as claiming to be against the state while encouraging participation in the electoral system. The idea of "anarcho-capitalism" is debated, with some arguing that the term itself is "anti-market" and scares people away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The definition of "ideology" is discussed as putting political positions above "concrete morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

### External Influences
The role of external influences is raised, with discussions about Brazil's position in a "new anti-world order" and its strategic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>. There's concern that foreign interests seek to prevent Brazil from exercising its sovereignty over its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:10:49">[02:10:49]</a>. The Forum of São Paulo is cited as an example of a long-term plan to gain power in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.

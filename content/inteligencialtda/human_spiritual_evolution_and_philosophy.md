## Introduction to Existential Inquiry
The "Limited Intelligence" program aims to explore profound topics with individuals considered "smarter, more interesting, and with life much more [[Spirituality and personal growth|spiritual]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The host admits his own life is not very spiritual or mythological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The show delves into areas of great curiosity, such as [[mythology_and_spirituality|mythology]] and [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs|spiritual teachings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.

## Historical and Mythological Perspectives on Creation and Evil

### The Problem of the Creator and the Origin of Evil
Mythologies, predating modern religions by thousands of years, offer alternative explanations for existence and the nature of "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. They propose a "cosmic egg" or "singularity" from which reality emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This creation involved a "fallen creator" who made a mistake at the moment of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. This creator is described as having "reconstructed himself in the inner part of the universe that he created in the worst possible way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

The concept of evil, according to mythologies, stems from this creator's initial mistake, rather than a malevolent intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. This "corruption" is embedded in the very "code" or [[human_evolutionary_history|genome]] of creation, including humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

### Mythology vs. Religious Accounts
Religions, emerging in the last 4,000 years, are seen as having manipulated and suppressed these ancient mythological narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. They often present God as perfect and omnipotent, shifting the blame for suffering and imperfection onto humanity through concepts like original sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## The Evolution of Religious Thought

### The Hidden Life of Jesus
The speaker delves into the period of Jesus' life between the ages of 14 and 20, which is not mentioned in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This period is discussed in spiritual revelations, which are presented as "gossip" or news that should be viewed with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

According to these narratives:
*   **The Missing Years:** After being found debating with doctors of law in the Sanhedrin at around 10-11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, Jesus asked about a figure named "Hackman" mentioned in the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Joseph of Arimathea:** Joseph, Jesus' earthly father, inquired about Hackman from his wealthy client, Joseph of Arimathea, a scholar of mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Years later, Joseph of Arimathea hired Jesus as a manager for his caravans, enabling Jesus to travel to places like Persia, India, and Egypt between the ages of 16 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Mary's Ancestry:** Mary, Jesus' mother, was a descendant of the Benj Gala Tribe from ancient Gaul (modern France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, explaining why the Galilee region in the Middle East was called "small Gaul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The Assyrian Empire had taken ten northern tribes, including Benjamin, as prisoners to their empire, which included parts of Gaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### The Three Faces of Jesus and the Catholic Church
The speaker identifies three "faces" of Jesus throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>:
1.  **Jesus the Galilean:** The version created by the original 11 apostles (excluding Judas from Judea), intended only for Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
2.  **Jesus the Christ (Superstar):** Invented by Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus), who encountered the resurrected Jesus and began spreading Christianity to the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:34">[01:54:34]</a>. Paul introduced concepts like "salvation" and "justification by faith" that Jesus never taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>.
3.  **Jesus the Living One:** Revealed through Mary Magdalene and a group of Hellenic Jewish disciples who formed a more liberal group.# Human Spiritual Evolution and Philosophy

The Assyrian Empire had taken ten northern tribes, including Benjamin, as prisoners to their empire, which included parts of Gaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### The Three Faces of Jesus and the Catholic Church
The speaker identifies three "faces" of Jesus throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>:
1.  **Jesus the Galilean:** The version created by the original 11 apostles (excluding Judas from Judea), intended only for Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
2.  **Jesus the Christ (Superstar):** Invented by Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus), who encountered the resurrected Jesus and began spreading Christianity to the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>. Paul introduced concepts like "salvation" and "justification by faith" that Jesus never taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>.
3.  **Jesus the Living One:** Revealed through Mary Magdalene and a group of Hellenic Jewish disciples who formed a more liberal group. This third perspective focused on Jesus as the resurrected one who continued to give new revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. These [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs|teachings]] were recorded in dozens of manuscripts, many of which were suppressed by the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>.

### Suppression and Dogma
The Catholic Church, particularly from the 4th century onwards, actively shaped Christian doctrine:
*   **Council of Nicaea (325 CE):** Constantine convened this council to transform Christianity into Catholicism, leading to the creation of the Holy Trinity myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>. This doctrine aimed to elevate Jesus to equal God, thereby diminishing his human side and distancing God from the Jewish Yahweh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:01">[03:22:01]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Gospels:** Approximately 4,000 gospels existed in the 4th century. Jerome, hired by Pope Damasus, selected which would be officially accepted (canonical) and which would be considered heretical or apocryphal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Gnosticism:** The teachings of the resurrected Jesus, as preserved by Mary Magdalene's group, led to Gnosticism, which emphasized "true knowledge" (gnosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:57">[02:52:57]</a>. Some Gnostics went further to call the God of Israel (Yahweh) "devil," a concept Jesus never used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:35">[02:53:35]</a>.
*   **Destruction of Texts:** Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria decreed the destruction of Gnostic books in 376 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. Monks hid many manuscripts, which were later rediscovered in places like Nag Hammadi in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:50">[02:58:50]</a>.
*   **The Book of Enoch:** Jerome removed the Book of Enoch from the Old Testament because it announced Jesus as a character and detailed the rebellion of angels and cosmogony, thus giving Enoch more weight than other prophets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:24">[02:7:24]</a>.

### The Problematic Nature of Biblical God and Dogma
The speaker asserts that the traditional Christian understanding of God and sin is illogical:
*   **Sacrifice:** The idea that God loved humanity so much He sacrificed His only son as a "Lamb to pay with his blood the sins of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a> is questioned, as it implies a need for blood sacrifice, which contradicts a truly omnipotent being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.
*   **Disobedience:** Jesus' plea to Yahweh on Holy Thursday to be spared the crucifixion, and Yahweh's refusal, suggests a complex and potentially flawed divine plan, where Yahweh sought to regain control lost since Adam and Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:20">[03:36:20]</a>.
*   **Dishonesty:** Theological justifications are called "ridiculous, simple, hollow and worst of all dishonest" because they disregard human logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:04">[03:38:04]</a>.
*   **Catholic Dogma:** Catholicism prioritizes the Church's interpretation of God's word over the literal text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:20">[03:41:20]</a>. Saint Augustine of Hippo, in the 4th century, decreed that life is wonderful and that questioning God's perfection or life's inherent suffering was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. This led to the belief that humans are "sinners" and the "disease of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:01">[04:50:01]</a>.
*   **Indulgences:** The Catholic Church created a system of indulgences, where people could pay money to absolve sins, effectively monetizing salvation to finance crusades and cathedrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:50">[05:51:50]</a>.

### The Myth of Lucifer and Angels
The concepts of Lucifer, Satan, and the Devil are primarily inventions of religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:16">[03:39:16]</a>. These beings exist but not in the terms typically presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:27">[03:44:27]</a>. The "evil" that exists is an "imperfection created from the fall of this being [the Creator] and all his descendants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:25">[03:46:25]</a>.
*   **Baphomet:** The Templars, who sought to separate the historical Jesus from Judaism, were accused of worshipping Baphomet, a figure representing the "great head of wisdom" or "Chokmah" (the second sephirah in Kabbalah) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:15">[04:35:15]</a>. The Church twisted this into the devil, giving rise to the horned depiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.
*   **Angels:** Angels are described as "robotic beings" or "clones" of Yahweh, created to obey him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:08">[05:12:08]</a>. They lack individual will and are categorized as entities in a neighboring anti-material universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:16">[05:15:16]</a>. The human tendency to call any non-human being "God" or "angel" has led to conceptual confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:44">[05:28:44]</a>.

## Human Condition and Rationality

### Critique of Unquestioning Faith
Humans are often "addicted" to collecting "certainties" rather than embracing uncertainties, as suggested by philosophers like Immanuel Kant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. This addiction to certainty, often found in religious faith, leads to a distorted understanding of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:54">[05:39:54]</a>. The reliance on God to solve all problems creates a "dystopian" world where human responsibilities are neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:28">[05:58:28]</a>. This "childishly understood" religious faith is seen as the biggest obstacle to human progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>.

### Personal Responsibility and Dignity
The speaker advocates for personal responsibility and dignity, rather than constantly seeking divine intervention or expressing gratitude for selective blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:03">[06:47:03]</a>. He suggests that genuine [[role_of_virtues_in_personal_growth|virtues]] like compassion and self-alignment are more honorable than religious rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:01">[06:50:01]</a>.

## The Afterlife and Reincarnation

### [[relationship_between_body_soul_and_spirit|Relationship between Body, Soul, and Spirit]]
The human "self" is not the physical body but rather an "epiphenomenal process" of the connectome (the intricate network of neurons and synapses in the brain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:03">[05:56:03]</a>. This "self" survives the death of the physical body, continuing to exist uninterruptedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:02">[05:55:02]</a>.

According to ancient Hindu Aryan traditions (Upanishads), each human being is composed of seven bodies: a lower quaternary (physical, etheric, emotional, mental) and an immortal triad (atmic, buddhic, manasic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>. Upon death, the physical body and lower quaternary should ideally dissolve to release the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:07">[06:09:07]</a>.

### Post-Mortem Experience and Karma
The quality of one's consciousness at death, particularly one's attachments, determines the post-mortem experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:12">[06:00:12]</a>. If an individual is highly attached to earthly desires (e.g., sex, food, drugs), their "self" will remain in a mental loop, unable to move on, potentially becoming a "lost soul" or "backrest" that feeds off human effluvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:57">[06:06:57]</a>.
*   **Mantras:** Practicing a mantra consistently, as taught by Tibetans and Hindus, helps to align the mind and maintain dignity at the moment of death, allowing for a more graceful transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:02">[06:11:02]</a>.
*   **Reincarnation:** If the lower bodies retain "negative files" or unresolved issues, the immortal triad is forced to "produce new bodies to pass on the dirty code from previous life," leading to reincarnation until these issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:07">[06:14:07]</a>. This process is not an act of love but a "brutal, selfish need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:17">[06:16:17]</a>.
*   **Karma:**
    *   **Sanchita Karma:** The general bank of files from many lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:58">[06:16:58]</a>.
    *   **Prarabdha Karma:** The incarnational program for a specific life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:03">[06:17:03]</a>.
    *   **Agama/Agam:** The way one faces predetermined challenges, representing free will and potential for merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:10">[06:17:10]</a>.

## Challenges to Human Existence

### Biological and Social Degradation
Humanity faces severe challenges due to accumulated problems in all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:35">[06:19:35]</a>.
*   **Viruses:** Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan, manipulates the behavior of its hosts (like rats confusing cat urine with a mate's scent) to complete its life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:10">[06:23:10]</a>. It has also invaded humans, potentially contributing to accidents and suicides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:28">[06:26:28]</a>. COVID-19, similarly, can affect the human brain, altering personality and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:06">[06:30:06]</a>. These biological manipulations may be part of an external intention to "dehumanize the human being" or reduce human numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:53">[06:33:53]</a>.
*   **[[Spiritual perspectives on modern technology and control|Planetary Control]]:** The world is moving towards a dystopian future where artificial intelligence and powerful corporations dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:48">[06:48:48]</a>. Current global politics, with the rise of neoconservatives and a disregard for diplomatic decompression, point towards inevitable conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:50">[06:50:50]</a>. The UN, despite its intentions, has become ineffective in resolving global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. State terrorism, perpetuated by powerful nations, fuels retaliatory terrorism from oppressed populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:25">[07:22:25]</a>.

## The Role of [[Spirituality and personal growth|Spirituality]] and Personal [[role_of_virtues_in_personal_growth|Growth]]

### Confronting Reality
Instead of waiting for divine intervention, humanity must "suffer shocks of Reality" to awaken from its "mental disorder" and take responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:52">[07:51:52]</a>. The speaker believes that humanity is in "danger" but that many individuals will continue to strive for dignity and decency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:03">[08:01:03]</a>.

### The Search for Truth and Uncertainty
The speaker constantly questions his own assertions, stating, "I don't know if ISO is right and I don't even want to know, but I want to get up, I don't want you to trust me, I'm not even trying to tell you convincing is just a matter of reflection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:31">[05:36:31]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of collecting uncertainties and possibilities, rather than clinging to definitive "truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:27">[05:54:27]</a>.

### Megalithic Constructions and Extraterrestrial Influence
Ancient megalithic structures like the Giza pyramids and Angkor Wat temples are presented as evidence of extraterrestrial influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:11">[08:50:11]</a>. The precise alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's belt, and Angkor Wat with the Draco constellation, indicates advanced astronomical knowledge that could only have come from non-human builders around 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:01">[09:43:01]</a>. The Dogon people of Africa also possess ancient knowledge of the Sirius star system, including stars invisible to the naked eye, suggesting an extraterrestrial origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:50">[09:49:50]</a>. These structures contain messages for future generations, which largely remain undeciphered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:16">[09:59:16]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current human experience is a "dystopian time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:43">[05:58:43]</a>, characterized by a lack of dignity and an absurd acceptance of suffering, which is often attributed to a flawed creator or collective human "mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:52">[07:51:52]</a>. The path forward involves embracing personal responsibility, fostering dignity, and continuously seeking understanding through both scientific inquiry and honest reflection on [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs|spiritual teachings]], rather than relying on outdated dogma or external saviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:02">[08:42:02]</a>.

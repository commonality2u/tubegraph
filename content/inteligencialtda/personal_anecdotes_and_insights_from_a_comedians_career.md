The comedian, Léo Lins, delves into his extensive career, offering insights into his unique comedic style, the challenges he has faced, and his philosophy on humor and freedom of expression.

## Career Beginnings and Evolution
Lins started his stand-up [[comedy_careers_and_personal_stories | comedy career]] in November 2005, initially driven by the simple goal of making people laugh [01:00:00]. His early career involved writing jokes even before performing stand-up [00:49:51]. He describes his initial motivation as wanting to make as many people laugh as possible, not seeking fame or fortune [01:55:00].

He intentionally focused on "bizarre themes" and "little explored" topics, setting himself apart from common themes like relationships, which he found "universal" but less appealing [01:01:18]. His first text, in 2005, already featured [[influence_of_personal_experiences_on_comedy | dark humor]] [01:05:15]. Over time, he developed a unique "persona" that allowed him to deliver specific types of jokes [01:39:41].

A significant turning point was moving from Curitiba, where he started, to Rio de Janeiro and later São Paulo, recognizing the need to expand his reach beyond local audiences [01:55:34]. Television, specifically his 11-year tenure on SBT's *Agora É Tarde* (Now It's Late), became a crucial medium to reach millions of people [01:57:16].

## Philosophy on Humor and Challenges
Lins defines a joke as something intentionally designed to make people laugh, emphasizing that not everything people laugh at is necessarily a joke [03:07:07]. He highlights the basic structure of a joke, consisting of a "setup" (information) and a "punch" (conclusion), with most jokes relying on surprise rather than confirmation [03:16:18]. He also points out that humor thrives on conflict, creating a "shock to the brain" when expectations are broken [03:32:51].

### On Cancellation Culture and Censorship
Lins has openly discussed his [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | experiences with cancellation culture]]. He contrasts his situations with other public figures like Luisa Sonza and Bora Bill, highlighting perceived double standards in media treatment [00:03:37]. He believes that criticisms often stem from misinterpreting a joke as an opinion [01:32:19] or failing to understand the context of comedy as distinct from real-world statements [01:33:43].

He notes that his "Disturbing" show encountered direct censorship from city halls in places like Caraguatatuba and Taubaté, where his performances were arbitrarily canceled [02:53:19]. In some cases, he even resorted to obtaining judicial injunctions to perform, only to find theaters locked by municipal employees [02:57:50]. These incidents often led him to incorporate the censorship into his routine, turning tension into new material [01:11:20].

He distinguishes his approach from what he calls "truculent militancy" by groups who seek to "cancel" or destroy careers rather than promote understanding or change [02:00:22]. He argues that such actions, including filing police reports over jokes, are disproportionate and ultimately stifle artistic expression [02:11:39].

### The "Black Humor" Debate
Lins addresses the controversy surrounding the term "black humor" (humor negro), which some consider a racist term [01:00:00]. He asserts that his research indicates no racist origin for the term, linking it to French surrealist André Breton's "Anthology of Black Humor" [01:43:27]. While he also uses "acid humor" (humor ácido), he resists changing his terminology due to external pressure [01:43:56].

### The "Tragedy Plus Time" Concept
A core aspect of his philosophy is that "life up close is a tragedy and from afar it is a comedy" [01:06:32]. He explains that humor often requires distance—physical or psychological, including the passage of time—to be appreciated [01:06:45]. For instance, a deeply personal tragedy can become material for a joke years later, once sufficient emotional distance is achieved [00:42:52].

## International Experiences and Media
Lins has performed internationally, including at a Netflix festival in Los Angeles where he participated in a Portuguese-language show for Brazilians alongside other [[experiences_of_performing_in_comedy_clubs_and_interacting_with_other_comedians_in_brazil | Brazilian comedians]] like Murilo Couto, Maurício Meirelles, Rafinha Bastos, and Bruna Louise [00:53:57]. He also attempted to perform in Japan, but a past joke about the country's tsunami caused visa issues, leading to a direct meeting with the Japanese consul [01:07:49].

Beyond live performance, Lins has conducted numerous interviews with Hollywood figures, including Tim Burton, Quentin Tarantino, and Matt Damon [03:13:08]. These interviews, often with strict time limits, required quick wit and improvisation to create memorable moments [03:13:43].

## Future Projects and Artistic Vision
Looking ahead, Lins plans to release another book on comedy technique [01:19:18]. He is also keen to explore the film industry, with a completed script for a slasher movie and an idea for a comedy film, aiming to shoot them independently if necessary [02:54:00]. He continues to manage his "Humor Factory" online store, selling books and merchandise, and offering a platform for other comedians [02:59:57].

Lins believes the current era is "excellent" for comedy due to the heightened tension and numerous topics that are considered controversial [02:02:06]. He sees this as an opportunity for comedians to generate significant laughter by addressing forbidden subjects, as long as they maintain their artistic integrity and focus on humor over offense [02:07:53]. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity and not conforming to external pressures, even if it means facing criticism or "cancellation" attempts [00:58:43].

Douglas Viegas, known as "the very powerful Ninja" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and "the most powerful Ninja on your channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> on Twitch's YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, shares his [[Human Spiritual Evolution and Philosophy | life philosophy and experiences]] through various anecdotes and insights. He is also a collector of keychains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Core Philosophy

### Chaos and Organization
Douglas Viegas views life as an "organized chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. He believes that to grow and be challenged, one must organize this chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. A story where everything goes well only happens in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### The Power of Attitude
According to Viegas, attitude changes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. He illustrates this by recalling a new team member, Gu, who proactively messaged him to join the podcast team, showcasing the impact of attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### The Law of Sowing and Reaping
A central tenet of his philosophy is the "law of sowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:56">[02:20:56]</a>. He states that planting is optional, but harvesting is mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. If you plant nothing, you reap nothing; if you plant "shit," you reap "shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:52">[02:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. Therefore, the only option to reap good things is to plant good things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16">[02:23:16]</a>. This extends to every action, as planting never stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:29">[03:55:29]</a>.

### Paying Debts and Evolution
Viegas views challenges and suffering as "debt payment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, a necessary process for [[Human Spiritual Evolution and Philosophy | personal evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. He believes that God is perfect and nothing happens that isn't deserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. He sees himself as constantly in a process of paying debts and aiming to honor all of them in this life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:35">[03:59:35]</a>.

### The Importance of Spirituality
Douglas Viegas strongly emphasizes the [[Role of spirituality and virtues in personal development | role of spirituality]] in life. He believes that when one takes care of the spiritual aspect, everything else starts to fall into place – physical, intellectual, and personal aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. He advises prioritizing spiritual care first, second, and third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. This spiritual care has transformed his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

### Living in the Present
He stresses the importance of living in the "here and now," not worrying about the past or the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. He believes that by focusing on doing the best in the present moment, one creates a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.

### Encouragement Over Criticism
Viegas advocates for encouraging others rather than criticizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>. He suggests that those who send negative messages are merely projecting their own issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:46">[02:06:46]</a>. He doesn't respond to negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:29">[02:27:29]</a> and believes that a person's actions speak for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>.

## Key Life Experiences and Insights

### Sports and Personal Growth
Douglas Viegas was a basketball player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a> and wanted to become a professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. He states that sport is everything, teaching health, education, and how to deal with victory and defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:38">[02:47:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:50">[02:57:50]</a>. He uses the example of sharing water with teammates after a tough run, emphasizing unity and overcoming differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:45">[02:54:45]</a>. He believes sport can unite people of different social classes and religious backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

### Political Journey
Viegas is a substitute councilor in São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a>. His political journey is motivated by a desire to serve and promote sports, especially building courts and leagues for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:52">[02:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:01">[02:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:05">[02:45:05]</a>. He emphasizes that he is doing this because "someone has to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:09">[02:43:09]</a>.

### Family Influences
He has two families: his biological parents and an American family that adopted and educated him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. His American father taught him the importance of treating job searching like a full-time job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. He notes a common tendency for people to treat those closest to them, like mothers, with less patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.

### Spiritual Awakening and Practices
Viegas underwent a significant spiritual transformation after studying philosophy and comparing different religions in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. He shares an argument for God's existence: while anything earthly can be imagined as bigger, one cannot imagine anything greater than God, implying His perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

He practices prayer, which for him involves silence and listening to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:59">[02:24:59]</a>. He also uses a natural "snuff" derived from roots and plants, applied to the nostrils, which he describes as a powerful tool for meditation and clearing negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.

### The "Talarico" Theory
Douglas Viegas introduces a controversial theory about the "talarico" (a person who tries to steal another's partner or opportunity). He argues that if "love is real," it must withstand competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>. If a partner leaves for someone else, it's not a loss but a liberation from a relationship that wasn't strong enough. He believes the "talarico" forces everyone to "raise their level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:30">[01:36:30]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Virtues

### Continuous Improvement
He believes in constant [[Role of virtues in personal growth | personal improvement]], striving to be a better person daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:04">[02:44:04]</a>. Viegas emphasizes that self-awareness and self-correction lead to personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>. He sees setbacks as opportunities to learn and do better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

### The "Two Wolves" Analogy
Viegas references the Native American story of two wolves, one representing hate and the other love, constantly fighting within a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. The wolf that wins is the one you feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>. This highlights the choice an individual has in cultivating positive or negative energies.

### Honoring Commitments and Relationships
He uses the example of lending money to a friend to illustrate the importance of honoring commitments. If the friend repays, a strong bond is created; if not, it reveals a lack of trustworthiness, allowing one to remove such individuals from their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>. He stresses that "little things are the gigantic ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>, meaning small actions build character.

### Seeking Happiness and Purpose
Viegas encourages people to pursue what they love, as it moves away negative thoughts and connects them with a "love vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He believes the purpose of life is to be happy and to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:46">[03:48:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:01">[03:49:01]</a>. He cherishes the joy of seeing others succeed and being inspired by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:58">[03:49:58]</a>.

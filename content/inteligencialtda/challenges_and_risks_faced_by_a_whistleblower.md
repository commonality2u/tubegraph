Frank, a former member of the PCC (First Capital Command), has taken on the role of a whistleblower, aiming to expose the realities of organized crime and deter young people from joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. His decision to speak out has plunged him into a life fraught with significant [[Challenges and risks faced by a whistleblower|challenges and risks]].

## Immediate Dangers and Constant Flight

Frank's whistleblowing journey began from a moment of despair, as he believed he was going to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. After his first video gained traction, he has been constantly on the run for nearly nine months, moving from city to city and even country to country across South America, including Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. He avoids staying in one place for more than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Frank recounts the terrifying reality of his daily life:
> "Every day I receive the threat. Every day people send me videos of people losing their lives being tortured saying that they're going to get me this and that and every day. This is very difficult for me... we are trying to survive every day and without anyone's support, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>

He maintains that his survival is due to God's will and his constant evasive actions, such as using IP camouflage and VPNs, and continuously changing residences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.

## Reasons for Frank's Exclusion and Decree

Frank's formal break from the PCC occurred after he attempted to leave the organization, expressing a desire to work and spend more time with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. He was initially given a "removed" status, which meant 90 days of rest from organizational activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. However, this changed when he spoke about an internal PCC maneuver that he couldn't prove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This led to his "exclusion" and being "decreed" by the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Being "decreed" means that any criminal in the State of SÃ£o Paulo can take his life without having to go through a crime court, marking him as a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. His complaints against criminals began only after he was decreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Financial and Personal Hardships

Frank faces severe financial difficulties as his YouTube accounts and Pix donation channels have been blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. He needs to file income tax returns and pay fines to try and unblock his funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. He lives hand-to-mouth, constantly worrying about where he will live and eat the next month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>. Living in South American countries is significantly more expensive than Brazil, adding to his burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>.

His own family has been impacted; his mother filed a threat report against him and obtained a protective order when he joined the PCC, severing contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>.

## Lack of Official Support

Despite the grave risks he faces, Frank asserts that he has received no support from politicians or government entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>. He claims that a prosecutor even labeled him a "farce" and a "fifth category" criminal, questioning his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:12">[02:29:12]</a>. He finds it disheartening that public officials doubt his experience while he is actively exposing criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.

He emphasizes that Brazil lacks a robust witness protection program, unlike the United States where whistleblowers receive police protection and identity changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. He also notes that such protection is often reserved for those who can provide information on "big fish" criminals, not the local "discipline" members he exposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

## Challenges in Public Perception and Justice System

Frank faces public scrutiny and criticism for his past. He explicitly states he does not apologize for his criminal history but seeks to redeem himself by helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>. He believes the justice system is flawed, citing his own experience of being arrested for armed robbery and released 23 days later on R$25 bail, with his case later archived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

He argues that the media, series, and movies often romanticize crime, creating a distorted view for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>. This glamorization, he believes, makes it harder for people to grasp the true, brutal nature of organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:12">[03:10:12]</a>. He stresses the need to portray crime as shameful and to empower the police to act decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:39">[03:09:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Frank's life as a whistleblower is a testament to the severe [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | personal anecdotes and challenges]] and risks involved in exposing organized crime. He continues his mission despite the constant threats, financial instability, and lack of official support, driven by a desire to educate and protect young people from the path he once took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. His story underscores the urgent need for systemic changes to combat the deep infiltration of organized crime in Brazilian society and to support individuals who bravely speak out against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>.

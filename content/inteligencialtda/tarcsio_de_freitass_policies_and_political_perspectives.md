Tarcísio de Freitas, a prominent figure in Brazilian politics, has served as a Minister of Infrastructure and is currently the Governor of São Paulo. His career reflects a focus on technical expertise, public service, and a strong alignment with Jair Bolsonaro's political movement.

## Professional Background and Achievements

Before becoming Governor of São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas served as the Minister of Infrastructure under Jair Bolsonaro. His tenure was marked by significant infrastructure projects and efforts to combat corruption.

### Combating Corruption and Improving Efficiency
De Freitas oversaw initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing corruption in public entities. At CEAGESP (Companhia de Entrepostos e Armazéns Gerais de São Paulo), he appointed Colonel Mela Araújo to "clean up" the organization, addressing issues like R$1,000 monthly kickbacks from cart pushers, R$100 monthly tips from coffee sellers, bribes for truck parking, and inflated box rental contracts [00:20:06]. This action led to a significant increase in revenue, with an estimated R$1 million per month previously diverted [00:21:13]. The Port of Santos, which previously reported a loss of R$500 million per year, ended up with a profit of R$500 million under Bolsonaro's government, with Tarcísio involved in such changes [02:08:01].

### Infrastructure Projects
Tarcísio de Freitas is credited with delivering various infrastructure projects across Brazil, earning him the nickname "exterminator of bottlenecks" [01:45:41].
Some notable projects include:
*   The **Bonan Bridge** in Rondônia, which connected Acre to the rest of Brazil without the need for a ferry crossing over the Madeira River [01:46:18].
*   Extensions and duplications in the **Itaipu** region, including the duplication of highway BR-469 and the construction of the second Foz do Iguaçu international bridge, benefitting over 50 municipalities around Taipu Lake [02:08:35].
*   The **Barreiro Bridge**, which saw a structural reform enabling the future passage of the VLT to São Vicente [02:41:10].

## Governorship of São Paulo

As Governor of São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas has continued to implement policies aligned with conservative principles and economic development.

### Key Policies in São Paulo
*   **Land Regularization**: He has championed land regularization in Pontal do Paranapanema, a region historically dominated by the MST and PT, by delivering land titles and promoting agribusiness [02:34:50]. This policy has reportedly contributed to electoral success in local municipalities [02:35:01].
*   **Civic-Military Schools**: De Freitas has continued the program for civic-military schools, successfully defending its continuation in the Supreme Federal Court (STF) [02:35:22].
*   **School Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)**: He has pushed for PPPs to create new schools and add 35,000 new vacancies, which was also questioned and upheld by the STF [02:35:34].
*   **Privatization of Sabesp**: The privatization of Sabesp, São Paulo's basic sanitation company, has also been successfully defended by his administration in the STF [02:35:47].
*   **Fiscal Management**: He successfully defended the state's revenue against a R$7 billion loss in the STJ, preserving funds for investment [02:36:10].
*   **Santos-Guarujá Tunnel**: De Freitas negotiated an agreement with the federal government to move forward with the Santos-Guarujá tunnel project, citing São Paulo's greater legal and financial capacity for Public-Private Partnerships compared to the federal government [02:36:38].
*   **Police Compensation**: He supports a legislative project in São Paulo to increase compensation for families of police officers who die in service from R$200,000 to R$1 million, with voluntary contributions from active police officers [02:47:06]. This initiative aims to provide financial security for families [02:48:32].

### Relationship with Federal Institutions
Tarcísio de Freitas maintains an institutional relationship with the STF and the federal government, prioritizing the interests of São Paulo. He actively engages with ministers and the presidency to secure investments and defend state policies, even when those policies face legal challenges [02:35:58], [02:37:51].

## Political Perspectives and Affiliations

Tarcísio de Freitas is a staunch supporter of Jair Bolsonaro and identifies strongly with the conservative movement.

### Loyalty to Bolsonaro
De Freitas consistently affirms his loyalty to Jair Bolsonaro, stating, "My candidate is Bolsonaro too" [02:34:34] and "We're going to be together with Bolsonaro even underwater" [01:31:57]. He sees Bolsonaro as a mentor who "opened the door" for him in politics by betting on technicians rather than traditional party affiliations [01:12:45]. He emphasizes that there is no "baton passing" between them, as he believes Bolsonaro remains a highly viable candidate and the greatest right-wing leader [01:31:16], [02:38:00].

### Views on Legal and Political Processes
Tarcísio de Freitas asserts that he has never seen Bolsonaro plan or set up anything outside the Constitution [01:14:45]. He dismisses claims of a coup attempt on January 8th, stating that a coup requires a strong leadership, military forces, and financial backing, none of which were present [00:48:50], [01:14:14]. He believes the January 8th events were "all set up by them to simulate what is being accused" [00:39:34], with open doors in public buildings being a deliberate action [02:06:21].

Regarding the judiciary, while he maintains an institutional relationship, he supports discussions to increase the security and address doubts about the electoral system, implying that transparency is paramount [01:11:23]. He condemns the speed of proceedings against Bolsonaro compared to other cases like Mensalão or Lula's trials [01:33:00]. He is also critical of the "bad will or desire to incriminate" Bolsonaro [01:10:44].

### Future Political Aspirations
Tarcísio de Freitas explicitly states that he is not a candidate for president and does not harbor such ambition [02:38:00]. His focus remains on his role as Governor of São Paulo and supporting Bolsonaro's political agenda [01:32:02]. He believes that Bolsonaro is the strongest candidate for the presidency and that the current political landscape is "disenchanted" with the current government [01:31:40].

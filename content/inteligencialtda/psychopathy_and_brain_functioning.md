[[Psychopathy and criminal behavior | Psychopathy]] is described not as a mental illness but as a [[Emotional and Personality Disorders | personality disorder]], meaning individuals are born with a specific type of brain functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. This condition is characterized by a lack of affection, empathy, and remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. Psychopaths view other people as objects to be used for their own status, amusement, or pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

## Functional Brain Differences
Advances in [[Neuroscience and brain research | neuroscience]] through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed key differences in the brains of psychopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:00">[01:0:00]</a>. These differences are not physical structural anomalies but rather functional disconnections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:0:00">[00:0:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>.

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Affection Area**: Psychopaths have a non-functioning brain in the area associated with affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:00">[01:0:00]</a>, specifically a "wiring that doesn't work" in this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>.
*   **Pain Perception**: Psychopaths experience less sensation of pain because pain has an emotional component, which they lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. They also don't anticipate the pain of trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
*   **Pleasure in Suffering**: Studies show that areas of the brain associated with pleasure can light up in psychopaths when exposed to terrifying scenarios, almost like an orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. They have a morbid fascination with suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>.

### Research Findings
In 2001, Brazilian scientists Ricardo Oliveira and Jorge Irm√£o Neto conducted a study using functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the brain activity of psychopaths and non-psychopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
The study involved:
*   20 psychopaths from the U.S. prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
*   Connecting their brains to a large computer inside an MRI machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
*   Showing various images, including peaceful scenes (like a sunset with calming music) and violent scenes (like a child being raped or war scenes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

**Results**:
*   Non-psychopathic individuals reacted with extreme repulsion to scenes of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   Psychopaths showed the same brain reaction to peaceful scenes as they did to violent ones; their brain activity did not change for terrifying images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Instead, terrifying things lit up an area associated with pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

## Psychopathy vs. Psychosis
It's crucial to distinguish [[Psychopathy and criminal behavior | psychopathy]] from [[Emotional and Personality Disorders | psychosis]]:
*   **Psychopathy**: Not a mental illness, but a [[Emotional and Personality Disorders | personality disorder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. Psychopaths are born with a brain functioning that lacks affection and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. They do not break from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. They justify their actions with calmness, believing their reasons are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.
*   **Psychosis**: A mental illness where an individual breaks from reality and experiences delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. They might believe things that are not real, such as having a chip implanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. A psychotic person's actions stem from their distorted reality, not from malice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

## Sociopathy and Psychopathy
The terms "sociopath" and "psychopath" are often used interchangeably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>, but the scientific community primarily uses "psychopath" due to the foundational work of researchers like Robert Hare, who developed the Hare checklist for identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. Historically, "sociopath" was used based on the theory that individuals are born good but are corrupted by society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>. However, modern neuroimaging studies indicate that psychopaths are born with their condition; society does not create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. A society tolerant of [[Psychopathy and criminal behavior | psychopathy]] can allow it to flourish and enable individuals with the condition to rise to positions of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>.

## Psychopathy in Children
The term "psychopathy" is not used to diagnose children; instead, they may be diagnosed with "conduct disorder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>. A minimum level of brain maturity is required before a diagnosis of psychopathy can be made in adulthood, typically after 18 years old in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:39">[01:57:39]</a>. While children may exhibit non-social or non-empathetic behaviors, the full diagnosis is reserved for later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. In some countries like England and Australia, age is not a barrier to imprisonment if a child demonstrates the ability to distinguish right from wrong and commits severe crimes with indifference and cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.

Psychopaths cannot be "fixed"; the goal of intervention is to avoid damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:36">[01:54:36]</a>. Because they understand the consequences of their actions, a strict education or legal system can inhibit their behavior by making them aware of severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:46">[01:54:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:09">[01:55:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:11">[01:55:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:33">[01:55:33]</a>. Activities like boxing can help channel their aggressive tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:43">[01:55:43]</a>.

## Psychopathy and Narcissism
While every psychopath is a narcissist, not every narcissist is a psychopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>. Psychopaths are specifically "perverse narcissists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. A typical narcissist desires to talk about themselves and believes they are super interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. A psychopath, however, believes they are a superior being and views non-psychopaths as fragile or idiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. For a psychopath, expressions of emotion like crying at the birth of a child are seen as pathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Societal Impact
Psychopaths are described as "social chameleons" who present themselves exactly as others wish to see them, making them highly effective predators in society, especially in social media environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. This makes them adept at manipulation, whether for financial gain (fraudsters) or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. They study their victims' desires and present themselves accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

Even in prison, psychopaths do not get depressed and find ways to ensure their comfort, often manipulating others to establish a "crime office" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:11">[01:43:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:13">[01:43:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>. They "reign" as predators within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:35">[01:43:35]</a>.

### Corruption and Cruelty
Corrupt politicians are often classified as moderate psychopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. Their compulsive stealing is not just for money but for the "cleverness" and to demonstrate their superiority over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Diverting public funds, even if it doesn't involve direct killing, is seen as causing death by destroying opportunities and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

The most severe psychopaths enjoy seeing others suffer and find pleasure in torture and cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. They believe they have the right to decide who lives or dies, seeing themselves as "God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This extreme coldness and desire to control others is a hallmark of psychopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Gender Differences in Psychopathy
Traditionally, it was thought that psychopaths were predominantly men, with a reported ratio of three men to one woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:42">[01:35:42]</a>. However, it is suggested that the actual ratio might be closer to one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>, as society may be less accustomed to identifying female psychopathy, which can manifest in more subtle, deceitful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:53">[01:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>.

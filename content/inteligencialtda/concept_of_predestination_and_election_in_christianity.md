From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The concepts of predestination and election are central to Christian theology, particularly within the doctrines of [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] and [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]]. These doctrines primarily concern [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] and God's role in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. While often seen as opposing views, proponents emphasize that both are orthodox and not heretical, and [[christianity_forgiveness_and_salvation | Christianity]] unites believers as brothers in faith, regardless of these doctrinal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Both perspectives agree that the Bible is the inerrant and infallible word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Historical Background: Calvinism and Arminianism

The theological debate between [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] and [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]] originated from the teachings of Jacob Arminius (died 1609), a Dutch theologian who emerged from within [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Arminius, director of the University of Leiden in Holland, began to question the more rigorous aspects of predestination and election prevalent in 16th-century Protestant scholasticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. John Calvin's original writings did not emphasize election as heavily as later Calvinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. By the 16th century, due to intellectual shifts, election became the central doctrine around which Calvinist theology revolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

In 1610, after Arminius's death, his followers presented a document outlining their disagreements with Calvinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This led to the Synod of Dort (1618-1619) in the Netherlands, which established the five points of Calvinism, known by the acronym TULIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The Synod declared that those who thought differently could not exercise pastoral ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Arminianism subsequently developed further outside the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Jacob Arminius is admired as a man of God with an unblemished reputation, serving the Lord with commitment despite theological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Neither the five points of [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] nor the five points of [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]] were developed by Calvin or Arminius themselves, but rather by their followers later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP)
The Synod of Dort defined five points of Calvinist [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | soteriology]] (the doctrine of [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>:
*   **T**otal Depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>
*   **U**nconditional Election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>
*   **L**imited Atonement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
*   **I**rresistible Grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
*   **P**erseverance of the Saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>

## Calvinist View: Divine Sovereignty and Predestination

Calvinism emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty and predetermination in all things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a>.
*   **Total Depravity:** Due to Adam's sin, all humanity fell, and men are born sinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:59">[03:32:59]</a>. The sinful nature corrupts the will, leading to a disgust for holy things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:55">[02:16:55]</a>.
*   **Unconditional Election:** God freely chose individuals for [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] before the foundation of the world, not based on any foreseen merit or actions of the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. This is seen in texts like Acts 13:48, where Gentiles believed because they "had been destined for eternal life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. Revelation 17:8 speaks of names "written in the book of life from the foundation of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. All Christians are considered elect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>.
*   **Limited Atonement:** Classical Calvinism asserts that Jesus Christ died only for the elect, making His death effective only for that specific group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>. This means His [[christianity_and_redemption | atonement]] was limited in scope to those already chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>.
*   **Irresistible Grace:** God's grace in drawing the elect to [[christianity_forgiveness_and_salvation | salvation]] is irresistible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>. When God acts to open a heart (like Lydia's in Acts), that person heeds the words and believes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:58">[02:09:58]</a>. The question remains why God doesn't open everyone's heart; the Calvinist answer is election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:11">[02:10:11]</a>.
*   **Perseverance of the Saints:** Once saved, a person cannot lose [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:52">[02:21:52]</a>. If someone apostatizes (abandons faith), it's because they had a false or "dead faith" and were never truly elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>. Perseverance of faith is seen as proof of election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>.

Calvinists maintain that God determines all things, every detail of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a>. His knowledge of the future is based on His predetermination, not simply foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:46">[02:40:46]</a>. This includes even seemingly negative events, as seen in Proverbs 16:4 ("the Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>.

The concept of "foreknowledge" (Greek *prognosis*) in texts like 1 Peter 1:20 and Romans 8:29 is interpreted by Calvinists not as mere knowing beforehand, but as "choosing beforehand" or "pre-ordaining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>. This understanding is rooted in a Hebrew idiom where "to know" can mean "to choose" (e.g., Genesis 18:19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>.

Despite divine determination, Calvinists affirm human responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. This creates an "insoluble theological tension" or paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. For example, Acts 4 describes Herod and Pontius Pilate acting wickedly, yet it states they did "everything that your hand and your purpose had predestined to occur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:12">[02:18:12]</a>. This tension extends to God's love and wrath; God is infinitely loving, but also possesses infinite wrath and justice, which harmonize in His inscrutable mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>.

## Arminian View: Foreknowledge and Human Choice

[[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]] emphasizes God's foreknowledge and human free will in the process of [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>.
*   **Election based on Foreknowledge:** God's election is based on His *foreknowledge* of who would believe and persevere in faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>. This implies a fixed number of saved individuals, but it's God's foresight, not His determination, that defines it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:45">[03:10:45]</a>.
*   **Unlimited Atonement:** Jesus died for *all* human beings, making [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] genuinely available to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a>. Texts like Titus 2:11 ("the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people") are cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>. The gospel invitation to "preach to every creature" is sincere because Jesus died for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:45">[02:06:45]</a>.
*   **Role of [[concept_of_free_will | Free Will]] and Human Responsibility:** Arminianism emphasizes that humans have the freedom to accept or reject God's grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:36">[02:13:36]</a>. While [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] is monergistic (God's work alone), God calls humans to participate synergistically by clinging obediently to His grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>. Even in their fallen state, humans can "extend the hand" and receive God's grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:26">[02:13:26]</a>.
*   **God's Universal Love:** God loves all human beings, and His love is part of His essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:55">[02:51:55]</a>. This love is unconditional and extends to all, even those who reject Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:09">[02:53:09]</a>. God's anger is not an antonym of love; those who love also get angry, but it doesn't mean they stop loving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>.

Arminians believe God's "prevenient grace" acts on everyone's heart, enabling them to respond to the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:48">[02:20:48]</a>. This grace prepares the person to receive the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>.

## Key Debates and Points of Contention

### Interpretation of "All" and "Every Man"
A significant point of debate is the interpretation of "all" (Greek *pas*) and "every man" in biblical texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a>.
*   **Arminian view:** These terms mean every human being, universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>. For example, Hebrews 2:9 states Jesus "tasted death for every man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:19">[02:42:19]</a>, and 1 John 2:2 says Jesus is the propitiation "for the sins of the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:02">[02:50:02]</a>.
*   **Calvinist view:** The word "all" can have a more limited sense in the New Testament, often meaning "all kinds of people" or "all without exception" (e.g., Jews and Gentiles), not necessarily every individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:37">[02:34:37]</a>. John 12:32, where Jesus says, "I will draw all people to myself," is interpreted as referring to people from all nations, not every single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:59">[02:36:59]</a>.

### God's Love and Wrath
*   **Arminian view:** God's love is universal, extended to all, and His offer of [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] is honest to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>. Those who are condemned are condemned for rejecting this love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:52">[03:01:52]</a>.
*   **Calvinist view:** God's love is infinite, but His wrath is also infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>. The Bible speaks of "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" (Romans 9:22), and that God makes the "wicked for the day of calamity" (Proverbs 16:4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>. These concepts coexist in God, even if humans cannot logically reconcile them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>.

### [[concept_of_free_will | Free Will]] vs. Divine Decree
*   **Arminian view:** Humans possess [[concept_of_free_will | free will]], defined as the freedom to make decisions without coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. Adam had complete [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] in Eden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. Though fallen, human responsibility for sin is 100% their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>.
*   **Calvinist view:** While humans have a will, it is tainted by sin and not "free" in the sense of being uninfluenced by corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>. Nobody can come to Christ unless the Father grants it (John 6:44) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>. The human will operates "within a sphere called God's decree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>. This is a paradox: individuals are responsible for their actions, yet God predetermined them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>. The question of how God can judge if everything is predetermined is a core "insoluble tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>.

### Order of [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | Salvation]] ( *Ordo Salutis* )
A specific point of divergence in [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] is the *ordo salutis* (order of [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:44">[02:51:44]</a>. The classical Calvinist position is that an individual is first regenerated (born again) and *then* believes in Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. Some Calvinists and Arminians agree that God's "prevenient grace" must act to prepare the heart before a person can respond to the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>. However, in [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]], this grace acts only in the elect, while in [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]], it extends to all who hear the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:48">[02:20:48]</a>.

The debate often highlights texts where God hardens hearts (e.g., Pharaoh, Israel in Deuteronomy 29:4, Isaiah 63:17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>. Calvinists view this as God's will and decree, while Arminians emphasize the individuals' prior rebellion and sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>. Ultimately, both sides acknowledge that some aspects of God's nature and actions remain incomprehensible to human minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:02">[03:10:02]</a>.

Marcelo, known for his audacious schemes, recounts a significant portion of his life marked by multiple arrests and subsequent prison escapes. Over the course of 11 years and nine months, he claims to have run away nine times, viewing escape as a natural consequence of his actions, rather than something to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

## Early Life and First Arrests

Marcelo’s life of "adventures" began early, as he started traveling Brazil and running away from home around ages 16 or 17, following his father's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His first arrest occurred in Balneário Camboriú for "ideological falsehood," leading to a short four-month stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. He consistently maintained multiple identities, even forging documents by hand to facilitate his activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. At one point, he was a fugitive from the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Methods and Motivations for Escape

Marcelo’s escapes were not always "forceful actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He often ran away *before* being judged for his crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. His methods varied, with one notable instance involving "taking the jail and opening it up" in Bangu, where he, along with others, devised and executed the escape plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. He attributes his success to observing the daily routines and weaknesses of the prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

He highlights two main reasons for his constant escapes:
1.  **Indispensability to the Cartel**: He claimed that the "Cartel" relied on him financially for their operations, making him invaluable and thus they could not leave him arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
2.  **Specialization in Rebellion and Escape**: Marcelo became highly dangerous due to his expertise in inciting rebellions and executing escapes. The system feared these two actions the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. Directors could lose their jobs if he rebelled or escaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

## Life as a Fugitive and Recapture

As a fugitive, Marcelo constantly changed identities and locations. During a period after selling stolen motorcycles, he was already wanted for document forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. He describes how easy it was to travel for free by pretending to be the nephew of a bus company owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

His recaptures often happened quickly after an escape, typically within 20 or 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. Despite the constant cycle, he claims he was never afraid of getting arrested because he "knew how to escape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. He felt he always had a plan prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

## Insight into Prison Dynamics

Inside prison, Marcelo leveraged his notoriety. His "fame" as a successful con artist and pilot meant others knew him, making it easier to establish connections and organize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. He claims that inmates respected certain "rules" and "lines" that shouldn't be crossed, such as those regarding sexual offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. There was an internal "trial" system for disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

Marcelo eventually became isolated within the prison system due to his high-risk classification from frequent escapes. He was deemed "highly dangerous" and held alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

> [!info] Reputation in Prison
> Marcelo's reputation as a high-profile criminal allowed him to quickly integrate into prison life, making acquaintances and even leading escape plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## Reflections on Escaping and Change

The decision to finally stop running and serve his sentence was the most difficult part of Marcelo's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This internal battle against his own instincts was a "constant fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. His decision was solidified when he began a relationship with his current wife, Ellen, who only learned of his true identity and criminal past after his arrest in Rondônia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Her unwavering support and commitment to staying by his side while he served his time deeply impacted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

> "The most difficult moment of my life, man, was deciding... to stop and change your life." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>

He chose to embrace a "peaceful life" and stated he would wait to leave prison at "my time" rather than escape prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>. Marcelo believes he has changed his "attitude" and now uses his intelligence for lawful purposes, working with lectures and consulting on fraud prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. His children are aware of his past and the consequences of his actions, and he has guided them to choose a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.

> [!important] Modern Challenges
> Marcelo notes that today, his past schemes would be "unthinkable" due to rapid information sharing via the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a>. He emphasizes that technology has made it much easier for scammers, but also provides new ways to combat fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

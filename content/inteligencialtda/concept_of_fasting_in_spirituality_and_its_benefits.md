Fasting, as discussed, is an ancient practice with roots in the Old Testament, extending into the New Testament, and carrying significant [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | spiritual]] and physiological benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>.

## Spiritual Discipline
Fasting is primarily defined as a [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | spiritual discipline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:59">[01:40:59]</a>. There is no true spiritual fast without prayer connected to it, alongside reading the Bible and seeking God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. Its purpose is to consecrate oneself to God for a specific reason, making the mind and spirit much sharper for [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | spiritual]] revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:55">[01:41:55]</a>. This practice is a way to show God, angels, and demons a "living sacrifice" by denying one's own will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>. It is a powerful method to tell the "flesh" (body and soul) that it does not rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Biblical Examples of Fasting
Several figures in the Bible demonstrated different forms of fasting:
*   **Moses** fasted for 40 days without food or water, a supernatural act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.
*   **Jesus** also fasted for 40 days in the desert, experiencing hunger afterward but not thirst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>.
*   **Daniel** fasted for 21 days, abstaining from rich foods and likely only consuming vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:41">[01:45:41]</a>.
*   The **Pharisees** also practiced fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>.

## Physiological Benefits
Beyond its [[impact_of_spirituality_on_life | spiritual]] dimension, fasting offers notable physical advantages:
*   **Increased Brain Function:** When not eating, blood flow to the digestive system decreases, allowing more blood to reach the brain, enhancing mental sharpness for study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.
*   **[[Intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets effects and considerations | Autophagy]] and Immunity:** Fasting allows the body to initiate a process called [[Intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets effects and considerations | autophagy]], where it consumes bad cells, leading to a much higher immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:38">[01:41:38]</a>.
*   **Pain and Inflammation Reduction:** A fast can alleviate inflammation and pain in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>.
*   **Ketosis:** When carbohydrates are cut, the body shifts to burning fat for energy, entering a state of ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:27">[01:43:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with Fasting
One individual shared a personal experience of a 40-day liquid fast in 2020, which resulted in a 25 kg weight loss, primarily for [[Spirituality and personal growth | spiritual]] purposes, seeking more revelation and anointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:13">[01:42:13]</a>. They noted that after about three days, hunger subsided, and they felt super energized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. This individual also connected compulsive eating habits to a "spirit of gluttony" that they overcame through a 40-day partial fast (no solid food from 6 PM to 6 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:16">[01:58:16]</a>.

## Fasting and the Fight Against the Flesh
Fasting helps weaken the "flesh," which is the combined force of the body and soul that often opposes the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:30">[01:48:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>. It's a way to discipline oneself and tell the body, "you don't send," particularly regarding appetites like food, which are often sought for comfort and pleasure due to emotional or hormonal factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>. The pursuit of pleasure, while a natural human motivation, can become an addiction, which fasting helps to counter by denying immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:44">[01:59:44]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Fasting
For those new to fasting, a recommendation is to start small, perhaps with a three-day liquid fast, consuming only water, or coconut water if feeling weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:43">[01:46:43]</a>. While [[Intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets effects and considerations | intermittent fasting]] has physiological benefits, spiritual fasting requires a purpose beyond mere dietary goals, focusing on connecting with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:56">[01:46:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>.

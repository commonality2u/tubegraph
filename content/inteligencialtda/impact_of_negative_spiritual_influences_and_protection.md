## Introduction
According to Daniel Mastral, negative spiritual influences are a real and impactful force in the world, affecting individuals and society. He stresses the importance of understanding these influences and the means of [[spiritual_warfare_and_protective_practices | spiritual protection]] available through [[Role of faith in overcoming spiritual struggles | faith]] and adherence to divine principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Nature of Negative Spiritual Influences
Daniel Mastral defines true magic as the power of God, which is stronger than any human-driven spell, preventing it from having results if one lives a life aligned with God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He explains that curses "without cause" find no landing, likening them to migratory birds that come and go if there's no "host" for them to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. A straight life before God acts as an armor, deflecting curses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. However, "holes" in this armor, such as pride, arrogance, greed, lies, and envy, create "legality" or "legitimacy" for negative influences to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These toxic feelings sadden the Holy Spirit within a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Intentional vs. Unintentional Harm
Harm can be wished upon others knowingly or unconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Simply vibrating at a negative frequency, through hatred or wishing ill, can project negative energy that may cause harm, such as leaving someone feeling bad or depressed, or experiencing minor accidents ("evil eye") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Studies with plants demonstrate that even thoughts can negatively affect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. If an individual is already feeling low, they are more susceptible to receiving negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Demonic Pacts and High Magic
When individuals enter into alliances or pacts with entities or demons, they gain powers, often through rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The devil is portrayed as a "good salesman" offering "wonderful business" like power, money, and fame, as seen in his temptation of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. These entities leverage human "vital energy" to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This "high magic" or witchcraft involves explicit rituals, often requiring "blood" sacrifices as vital energy exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>.

## Impacts of Negative Spiritual Influence
Negative influences look for loopholes or weak points in an individual's life to cause destabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>. For example, if someone idolizes their car, an accident involving it could be used to destabilize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. Spiritual attacks can lead to psychological and emotional distress, such as unmotivated depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:41">[03:21:41]</a>. In cases of possession, demons can manifest physically, causing the possessed individual to writhe in defiance of physics and speak with an altered voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. The speaker describes how demons drain the body's energy to enhance their own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>.

## Protection and Overcoming Negative Influences
[[Spiritual warfare and protective practices | Protection]] from negative spiritual influences is achieved primarily through a straight life before God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This involves:
*   **A "Tripod" of [[Role of faith in overcoming spiritual struggles | Faith]]**: A life of prayer, worship, and knowledge of God's word generates [[Role of faith in overcoming spiritual struggles | faith]], leading to more love and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Forgiveness**: Forgiving others, even "toxic" people or "executioners," is crucial, as unforgiveness "keeps ruminating inside you," causing internal harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Sanctification**: Seeking holiness and maintaining a pure life closes "holes" or "gaps" that demons exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>.
*   **Joy**: "Joy in the Lord is our strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. Happier people tend to live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.
*   **Verbalizing God's Word**: The "sword of the spirit" is God's word, and verbalizing it loudly is more powerful than silent prayer against demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>.
*   **Anointing Oil**: This is a tool and weapon that "breaks the yoke" of demonic influence. It is made according to specific biblical recipes, often with raw materials from Israel, and carries a "fragrance of God" that demons respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>. However, misuse can cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:04">[01:48:04]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Authority**: Individuals with [[Spiritual authority and battle | spiritual authority]] can command demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.

## Spiritual Beings and Hierarchy
Daniel Mastral clarifies the hierarchy and nature of spiritual beings:
*   **Lucifer**: Originally a beautiful angel and "anointed cherub," he became envious of God and wanted to be like Him, leading to his expulsion from heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>. He managed to persuade a third of the angels to follow him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.
*   **Satan/Devil**: "Satan" (Hebrew) means "adversary/opponent," while "devil" (Greek) means "the one who brings division" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>. Lucifer fell to Earth along with these angels/demons and is now confined to this "earthly dimension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Demons**: These are the fallen angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. They cannot multiply like humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:41">[02:33:41]</a>. They have an "energy" that can cause mutations in DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>.
*   **Giants (Nephilim)**: The Bible describes fallen angels copulating with earthly women, resulting in giant offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. This is explained by the entities carrying germ cells "charged with a kind of energy" that compromises or deforms DNA, leading to anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Angels**: They have higher mental capacity than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:37">[02:14:37]</a>. Angels can physically manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:27">[02:42:27]</a>. There is a hierarchy of angels (archangel, cherubim, seraphim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. God sends angels to protect His children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>.
*   **Territorial Spirits**: These are principalities that "hold back" angels trying to deliver answers, as seen in the story of Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>. These are high-ranking demons that control specific regions or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:11">[02:54:11]</a>.

## Real-World Manifestations and Prophecies
Mastral integrates biblical prophecies with current events and spiritual phenomena, contributing to an [[understanding_and_interpretation_of_spiritual_warfare | understanding of spiritual warfare]].
*   **The Antichrist and End Times**: The "Brotherhood of High Magic" actively prepares the global platform for the Antichrist's coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:47">[02:52:47]</a>. This includes controlling strategic points in society and promoting specific narratives. The Antichrist is depicted as the First Horseman of the Apocalypse, coming with "peace through his oratory" before "sudden destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
*   **False Prophet**: The Eighth King (a Pope) is prophesied to be the false prophet, who will provide support for the Antichrist, leading people to believe his words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>.
*   **Pandemics and Vaccines**: Current pandemics are seen as "training" for the population to become more submissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:58">[03:03:58]</a>. The speaker suggests a future "super vaccine" with a stamp containing "luciferase" (a substance with a curious name resembling "Lucifer") and nanorobots, linking it to the biblical "mark in your hand" for buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:41">[03:04:41]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Energy and Environments**: Places where significant suffering or death occurred, like hospitals with many deaths, retain a "negative charge" or "energy" that can be felt by sensitive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:49">[02:59:49]</a>. Cemeteries are considered "vortexes" of negative energy due to sadness and the presence of the dead, which "energy vampires" (demons) can feed from, causing exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:52">[03:04:52]</a>. Conversely, positive environments and "vortexes of energy" can be created through specific architectural designs (e.g., pyramids, sacred alignments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:12">[03:01:12]</a>.
*   **Adrenochrome and Child Sacrifice**: The theory that some sects (Brotherhood) use adrenochrome, a substance purportedly released when individuals die violently with fear, to slow aging is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:49">[02:05:49]</a>. This theory is linked to the high number of missing children and the practice of child sacrifice in rituals, which the speaker claims to have witnessed preparations for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:04">[02:09:04]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Lessons
Daniel Mastral shares his past involvement in Satanism and his subsequent conversion:
*   **Entry into Satanism**: He was "generated within a specific context" related to high magic and joined the "Brotherhood" not through choice, but by being "chosen" due to Kabbalistic, numerological, astrological traits, and bloodline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:59">[04:07:59]</a>. His doctrine taught that God was evil, citing Old Testament instances of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:42">[04:04:42]</a>.
*   **Failed Spells**: He recounts attempting to cast a killing spell on a pastor who was influencing a girl he was dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>. The spell failed, which was unprecedented and left him terrified of the pastor's spiritual power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>.
*   **Conversion and Peace**: During a confrontation with the pastor, he felt an unexplainable "peace" after being touched, leading to his conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:37">[01:59:37]</a>.
*   **Persecution and Divine Protection**: After converting, he faced threats and persecution from his former sect, who wanted to kill him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>. Through prayer and [[Role of faith in overcoming spiritual struggles | faith]], he experienced divine protection, including a visible manifestation of angels guarding his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. He later learned that two members of the sect who were actively bothering him died in a car accident, which he interpreted as God's judgment and a source of joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: He emphasizes that true [[Spiritual experiences and manifestations | demonic possession]] is rare and often misrepresented in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. He warns against "doctrine of demons" that misinterprets scripture to deceive people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. He also clarifies that "hereditary sin" is a misinterpretation; while genetic predispositions and imitation exist, each person is accountable for their own sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:47">[03:17:47]</a>.
*   **Pastor Luiz Augusto**: Daniel recounts the tragic story of the pastor who converted him, Luiz Augusto. This pastor was later mistreated and bullied by his church, left the ministry, fell into cocaine addiction and prostitution, but was eventually restored through [[Influence of spirituality and faith | prayer]] and his wife's perseverance, though he later died of an infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:42">[02:13:42]</a>. Daniel describes seeing a "very dark stain" around the pastor in photos, indicating an entity on his tail, suggesting that even after deliverance, one can still be a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:49">[02:16:49]</a>.

## The Eternal Nature of Jesus
Before his physical birth, Christ was already eternal God, never created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He is referred to as the Word (Logos), the very essence and action of God, through whom all things were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The Bible states that God the Father, God the Son (Christ), and God the Holy Spirit are three in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This concept of the Trinity is a mystery that cannot be fully understood but can be likened to water existing in solid, liquid, and gaseous states while remaining H2O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Jesus in the Old Testament
In the [[role_of_jesus_in_the_old_testament | Old Testament]], Jesus often appears as a messenger of Yahweh, sometimes translated as "angel of the Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Unlike created angels who refuse worship, this "angel of the Lord" accepts adoration, indicating his divine nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Examples include Moses before the burning bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> and Joshua before the battle of Jericho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. He is the exact manifestation of God's being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

### The Plan of Redemption
The incarnation and death of Jesus were not a reaction to humanity's sin but an eternal plan of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. Revelation 13:8 speaks of "the lamb that was slain since the foundation of the Cosmos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>, meaning Jesus's death was foreseen and decided in eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>. This foresight highlights God's unconditional love, choosing humanity despite knowing they would fall and require a Redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

## The Birth of Jesus
The birth of Jesus was a fulfillment of numerous prophecies from the [[historical_interpretations_of_biblical_events | Old Testament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### Prophetic Fulfillment
*   **Micah 5:2:** This prophecy foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem Ephratah, a small city among the thousands of Judah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:58">[02:37:58]</a>. This indicates that the one who would reign in Israel had origins "from ancient times, from the days of eternity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:37">[02:38:37]</a>.
*   **Isaiah 7:14:** This prophecy states that "the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (God with us) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. The virgin birth was crucial because sin is transmitted through the male line (Adam's disobedience), ensuring Jesus was without sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>.

### Historical Context
Caesar Augustus's decree for a census required Joseph and Mary to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, Joseph's hometown, fulfilling the prophecy of Jesus's birth in Bethlehem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>. This divine sovereignty ensured Jesus was born in the prophesied location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:19">[02:42:19]</a>.

### Satan's Opposition
Satan knew a Redeemer would be born and sought to kill him, as seen in Pharaoh's attempt to kill Hebrew boys when Moses was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:56">[02:33:56]</a>. Similarly, upon Jesus's birth, Herod, instigated by Satan, ordered the massacre of male children up to two years old in Bethlehem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:51">[02:46:51]</a>. However, God preserved Jesus by warning Joseph to flee to Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## The Crucifixion of Jesus
Jesus's death was not due to incompetence or weakness but a voluntary surrender to fulfill God's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

### Fulfillment of Prophecy and Symbolism
*   **Paschal Lamb:** Jesus died during the Passover festival, on the 14th day of the month, when the Paschal lamb was traditionally slain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. This symbolizes Jesus as the ultimate Paschal Lamb, whose blood provides salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.
*   **Sacrifice Timing:** At 9 AM, when Jesus was crucified, the morning sacrifice lamb was tied to the altar in the temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. At 3 PM, when Jesus died, the priest beheaded the sacrificial lamb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.
*   **Old Testament Foreshadowing:** The entire [[role_of_jesus_in_the_old_testament | Old Testament]] speaks of Christ through types and foreshadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:6:55">[02:6:55]</a>. The sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham, where God provided a ram, is a "type of Christ," showing that while Abraham did not have to sacrifice his son, God the Father did not spare His own Son for human salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was also a representation of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>.
*   **The Mark of Sin:** The mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant, sprinkled with blood once a year, covered the tablets of the law, the manna, and Aaron's rod, which symbolize humanity's sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This foreshadowed Jesus's blood, which not only covers but destroys sins, making believers "whiter than snow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

### Roman Mockery and Significance
Roman soldiers, bored and likely influenced by the *Saturnalia* festival (though it was not December), mocked Jesus by treating him as a condemned "king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. They put a scepter in his hand and a crown of thorns on his head, calling him "King of the Jews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. While Saturnalia involved a condemned slave temporarily posing as a king, in Jesus's case, it was "the King of the Universe, dying like a condemned slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.

### Voluntary Sacrifice
Jesus's death was a voluntary act; no one took his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. His purpose was to save humanity from sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>. When confronted by soldiers in Gethsemane, he identified himself by uttering "It's me" (Yahu, the name of God), causing them to fall to the ground, demonstrating his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. This highlights that his crucifixion was not the fault of the Jews or Romans, but a willing sacrifice for humanity's sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. His final words, "It is finished," translated as "tetelestai" in Greek, mean "it is paid," signifying the complete remission of sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

## Jesus's Ministry and Temptation
Before commencing his public ministry at age 30, a significant age for receiving authority in Jewish tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:59">[01:49:59]</a>, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a>. Despite fasting for 40 days and nights, Jesus resisted all temptations, demonstrating his sinless nature and qualifying him as the perfect sacrifice for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>. His teachings, delivered through the Sermon on the Mount, challenged the stereotypical laws of his time by emphasizing a change of heart and inner transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>. He showed unconditional love by touching and healing lepers, who were considered impure under the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

## The Promise of the Second Coming
The story of Jesus does not end with his death and resurrection, as he promised his [[first_and_second_comings_of_christ | second coming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>. Jesus spoke extensively about his return in the "Prophetic Sermon" (Matthew 24:2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a> and at the Last Supper (John 14), preparing his disciples for his departure and future return to take them with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. This return is portrayed as a wedding with the groom, a blessed hope, and an extraordinary period of peace called the Millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>.

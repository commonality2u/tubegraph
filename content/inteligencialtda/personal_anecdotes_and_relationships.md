She recently underwent nose surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Personal Background and Motherhood
Cris Paiva decided at 15 to have a daughter when she turned 18, and that daughter would be named Mariana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. This desire was documented in a letter she sent to her friend Mariana's mother, Aunt Tere, when she was 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Her primary motivation for choosing a teaching profession was to allow for part-time work, enabling her to be a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. She never truly wanted to be a teacher but pursued it to achieve her goal of early motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Her parents were also teachers, providing a reference, although her mother later became a school secretary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. Cris studied pedagogy at Unesp and taught for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

He later moved to São Paulo and joined the Pé na Rede group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They moved in together into Cris's house in Sorocaba, which was already furnished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Over seven years, they accumulated shared possessions like furniture and appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Cris managed the household finances, controlling the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

The breakup occurred unexpectedly around New Year's Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Her ex claimed his father was sick and needed to travel, leading Cris to believe he would spend New Year's quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. She later saw a photo of him at a New Year's Eve party with another woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. When she called him, he eventually responded via WhatsApp, and during the call, he stated he was "very happy" and "not married to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This sudden revelation led Cris to believe he had gone "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Two days later, he was posting photos with the new woman, indicating a swift change in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Rogério Vilela hosts an episode of "Limited Intelligence" featuring a guest who shares insights into their demanding career and life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The guest, a former military police officer, discusses his journey and various encounters throughout his service.

## Early Life and Entry into the Military Police
The speaker, born in Londrina, states he has no memories from there as his family moved to Maringá when he was a few months old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He grew up in Maringá, a city of over 400,000 inhabitants, playing outside "on the street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He recalls a "root childhood" involving playing in streams, mud fights, and "castor oil war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. He played cops and robbers, always choosing to be the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

At 16, he got into trouble for vandalizing a school wall with curse words and graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. One of his accomplices reported them, leading to his father being called to sign a document and requiring them to repaint the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He decided to move to São Paulo with his grandmother to escape the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In São Paulo, during the "economic miracle" of 1980, he easily found work, often in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. He also worked in a cattle slaughterhouse and at the Príncipe Hotel in Maringá, which his father managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

At 19, he joined the Military Police after passing an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. His desire to join stemmed from a childhood frustration when he couldn't get a ride in a police car, unlike other students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. His older brother, now a police colonel, explained the police entrance exam process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. He passed the Military Police competition in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Military Training and Character Formation
His training as a soldier was "rigid" and "tough," a process he is grateful for, as it provided structure and helped form his character and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. He describes the training as instilling a "without too much nutella" mindset, a "grotesque" approach that was normal at the time but might be seen as disrespectful today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. He highlights that he joined the police during the end of the dictatorship era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. He recalls a captain telling them to "fill this barracks with communists" during election season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

He expresses respect for the military regime, noting his family was never bothered, and he did not witness torture or deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. He admits to celebrating March 31st (the date of the military coup) and facing an ethics council complaint for it, though nothing came of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Career Progression and Retirement
His career began by entering through the "squares" door as a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. He was promoted through various ranks: corporal, sergeant (after a course in 1998-1999, which required him to shave his mustache), second sergeant by merit, and finally first sergeant, where he ended his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. He was mandated to retire on June 17th after 35 years of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Commanders would send officers home on their last day of service to avoid administrative problems if an accident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Retirement is also compulsory by age, which varies by rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. He reached the top of the pay scale for a first sergeant in Paraná due to his long service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

His last day of work was a normal shift, not a celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. His lieutenant joined his team for the final shift, and they conducted a major drug seizure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

## Highway Patrol Experiences
His last years of service were with the highway police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Their primary job was "catching bandits on the highways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Drug Smuggling
On his last day, he caught a young woman on a bus with 12 kg of marijuana hidden in a travel bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Her phone rang, leading to the capture of another woman, her girlfriend, at the bus station with an additional 10 kg of marijuana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They had intentionally traveled on different buses to avoid losing everything if one was caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. The younger girl, a minor, was accused of trafficking and corrupting minors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

He recounts an incident where a hidden compartment in an air compressor contained 7 kg of crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. This was only discovered after a Federal Revenue officer, attending a course in Foz do Iguaçu, saw an identical compressor model used for drug concealment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

He also details a cocaine seizure from a Monza's fuel tank, detected by a sniffer dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. The car was found to have a "compartmentalized" tank, with half for drugs and half for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

### Contraband
He specialized in catching contraband coming from Paraguay, which would then go to major Brazilian cities like São Paulo, Goiás, Brasília, and Minas Gerais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. Initially, individuals would bring goods within their quota (USD $300 at the time, now $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. Later, businessmen would hire 20 people to each carry a quota, accumulating large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

Common contraband items included:
*   Pirated games (CDs for Playstation, Xbox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>
*   Cell phone screens and spare parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>
*   Old Nokia phones and later iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>
*   Toys (electronic and general, often in bulky, colorful bags) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>
*   Dental supplies (pens for teeth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>
*   Vibrating microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>
*   Sex shop products, including vibrators and "little balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>
*   Fetish clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>
*   Hookah essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>
*   Electronic cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>
*   Video games (Playstation, Xbox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>
*   Counterfeit industrial bearings (NGK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>
*   Paraguayan blankets (7,000 in one truck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>
*   Toothbrushes (Brazilian brand, manufactured cheaper in Paraguay due to lower energy costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>

Trucks with cigarettes are often accompanied by a "beater," a scout car that drives ahead to check for police and warns the truck driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. This makes them difficult to catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. The "beaters" earn around R$ 5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.

### Weapon Smuggling
He also caught weapons, including airsoft guns, which he initially mistook for real firearms due to their realistic appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. These are often used for robberies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. The vast majority of real firearms come through smuggling, hidden within other loads like wheat or soybeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:53">[02:16:53]</a>. He recalls seizing 3,000 rifle ammunition rounds destined for Rio de Janeiro to "kill the police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>.

### Stolen Vehicles
He encountered many stolen vehicles, often with fake plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. He recounts catching two stolen Renegade jeeps driven by brothers, one of whom offered a R$ 5,000 bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. Another time, he stopped an S10 pickup truck whose plate matched a vehicle still in its owner's garage, revealing it was stolen from a supermarket parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. Stolen vehicles, like the Astra, are often modified to fit more cigarette boxes by stripping out the interior lining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.

### Human Trafficking
He has encountered cases of illegal entry into the country, including a bus full of Haitians entering Brazil via Paraguay without proper visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. He also describes catching an Arab family, including children, being brought into Brazil illegally from Paraguay due to bureaucratic hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

### Accidents and Fatalities
[[challenges_of_highway_patrol | Challenges of highway patrol]] include responding to accidents. The first priority in an accident is to signal the road to prevent further collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>. He advises against moving victims unless there's an imminent risk like fire, to avoid exacerbating injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>.

He recounts a horrific accident where a 15-year-old girl, recently arrived from the United States, was trapped and burned to death in a Pointer car that collided with a Corolla and caught fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. He notes the Corolla's passenger compartment remained intact, unlike the Pointer, highlighting car safety differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

He emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving, recounting incidents of drivers causing fatal accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. He describes how he would take keys from drunk drivers to prevent tragedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>. He witnessed a bus overturn near a river due to a driver attempting to overtake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>, where passengers were advised not to move due to the precarious situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>.

He also witnessed the aftermath of a motorcyclist being run over multiple times by cars on the highway, leaving his body dismembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. In another disturbing incident, a woman who had been missing and drinking was run over, and her head was detached by a car's rearview mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a>.

### Daily Routine and Challenges
He highlights that police work involves many "falls" or unsuccessful inspections, not just the visible seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. He stresses that finding drugs in hidden compartments like dashboards is often due to experience, not just tip-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. He believes people discredit police work out of ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.

He explains that he doesn't work on holidays and will sometimes go out to eat and then continue working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. He recalls an instance where his team stopped to eat pasta, but he decided to go out and "approach" a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>, which led to a seizure of 83 kg of crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

## Specific Incidents and Investigations
### Crack Seizure
In an incident near Dr. Camargo, while waiting for pasta, he inspected a Monza with a family inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. A small screw hole in the trunk floor revealed a false bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Despite the car having been approached by 8 army officers who found nothing, his team found 83 kg of crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. He states that this success was due to experience, not just information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

### Medicine Smuggling
He caught a car "stuffed" with various medications, hidden in the trunk and panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Brazilian law sometimes considers smuggling medicine more serious than drug trafficking, with sentences of 10-15 years compared to 5-15 years for drugs, because it is seen as "even more pernicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

Common smuggled medicines included:
*   **"Strong rheumatism" medications**: Prohibited by Anvisa (Brazilian health regulatory agency) because they are harmful to the stomach, but people use them because they are the only ones that allow them to get out of bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.
*   **Cytotec (abortifacient)**: Used for abortions, often leading to medical emergencies on the highway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.
*   **Viagra**: A lady in her 70s was caught with 200 cards of 10 pills each, hidden in a false bottom of her blouse, for sale in a senior condominium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.
*   **Sibutramine**: A weight-loss drug also prohibited by Anvisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a>.
*   **Anabolic steroids**: Including veterinary ones, smuggled for their high market value and small size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

### Robberies and Confrontations
He was involved in a confrontation where three armed men exited an Astra and shot at his police vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:26">[02:05:26]</a>. He returned fire from inside the car, breaking the windshield, which caused the suspects to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:51">[02:05:51]</a>. They found four long guns (12-gauge carbines), a vest with fake explosives (used to intimidate victims), and Miguelitos (iron spikes to puncture tires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>. This was one of the last and most dangerous occurrences of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:46">[02:07:46]</a>.

He recounts an incident where he entered a house alone, finding three men inside, who were surprised by his initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a>. Another time, he intervened to help a security guard whose revolver was being taken by a man with two fingers on the trigger; he managed to immobilize the assailant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:10:47]</a>.

He recalls an SW4 stolen vehicle chase where the suspects fired rifles at them, and his driver took a risky maneuver going the wrong way on a cloverleaf interchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:26">[02:13:26]</a>. The stolen vehicle collided with an F250, causing its engine to fly out and the car to roll five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:37">[02:14:37]</a>. A rifle bullet passed within 3 cm of his partner's kidney during the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>.

He states he has had to kill bandits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>. In one instance, after a series of robberies, a taxi driver tipped them off about bandits who had killed one of their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. His team surrounded the house, and four bandits were killed trying to escape through a back window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. He considers a dead bandit "a relief to society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:58">[02:22:58]</a>.

### High-Profile Criminal Cases
He recounts a case of a 10-year-old girl who was raped and killed in Maringá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>. The perpetrator was caught because the victim's younger sister saw her on the neighbor's bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:23:55]</a>.

He also details the case of Natanael Buffalo, a serial rapist and killer in the Maringá region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Buffalo, who worked in a circus, previously abused a 15-year-old girl with a revolver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:11">[02:25:11]</a>. After serving a sentence, he gained the trust of a church, then abducted, raped, and killed an 11-year-old girl from a church party, burning her body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>. Buffalo is now in prison, where inmates try to kill or lynch him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:24">[02:27:24]</a>.

He mentions the "Tower Maniac" from Maringá, who killed six or seven women, all prostitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:29">[02:30:29]</a>. The maniac was caught after a farmer saw his car hit a tree, leaving a paint chip that led police to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:06">[02:31:06]</a>. The maniac's mother was a prostitute, and he connected the towers of Campo Mourão with prostitution, leading him to kill sex workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:05">[02:33:05]</a>. One victim escaped by telling him about her two-year-old son, which touched his heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>. He recounts an earlier encounter with the Tower Maniac where he and another officer almost shot him after he attacked them with a pickaxe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>. He regrets not having shot him, believing it would have saved the victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:48">[02:35:48]</a>.

## Personal Reflections
He states that he suffered five heart attacks, three of which occurred inside military police vehicles while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:52">[02:36:52]</a>. One was triggered by the news of a friend being run over by a bus and dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:35">[02:37:35]</a>. Another occurred during a raid on a drug dealer's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:17">[02:38:17]</a>. His heart condition was diagnosed after 40 days of pain, leading to open-heart surgery with five bypasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:56">[02:41:56]</a>. He still experiences chest pain from physical exertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a>.

He differentiates between a productive life and drug use, stating, "not all pothead is a bum but all A bum is a pothead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>. He acknowledges knowing productive marijuana users but also many whose involvement led to harder drugs and crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:10">[02:56:10]</a>. He applies the same logic to alcohol, admitting he personally lost control, created administrative problems, and faced disciplinary actions due to drinking, leading him to abstain entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>.

## Transition to Politics
He states he was "pushed into politics" by people who saw his potential from interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:30">[02:44:30]</a>. He initially resisted, not seeing himself as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:51">[02:44:51]</a>. In 2014, he ran for federal deputy, gaining 50,608 votes, becoming the first substitute for his party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>. After mandatory retirement in 2017, he ran again in 2018, becoming the most voted federal deputy in Paraná with 314,963 votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>.

As a deputy, he aims to be the "voice" of the public, presenting projects "in favor of crime" and "in appreciation of Public Security operators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:52">[02:48:52]</a>. He believes valued public security operators (with decent wages, hours, and equipment) offer more to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:23">[02:49:23]</a>. He is working on a law that increases the number of rifles available to Paraná's Military Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:57">[02:11:57]</a>. He clarifies he is not a police unionist but a Deputy for Public Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>.

He supports a plebiscite on life imprisonment in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:06">[02:28:06]</a>. He is personally in favor of the death penalty for severe criminals like those involved in child murder, but acknowledges the difficulty of passing such legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:27">[02:28:27]</a>. He is working on a project to allow organs of criminals killed in confrontation to be compulsorily donated to transplant queues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:16">[02:53:16]</a>. He believes this is a way for criminals to "do something in return for society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He notes that the Chamber's board rejected this project as being "against human dignity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:37">[02:53:37]</a>.

He also advocates for a project typifying the "serial killer" in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>.

### Views on Censorship Bill
He is against the censorship bill ("PL da Censura"), primarily because it is reported by a "communist" deputy, Orlando Silva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:41">[02:57:41]</a>. He views the project as a "great lobby" by left-wing entities, television networks, and artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

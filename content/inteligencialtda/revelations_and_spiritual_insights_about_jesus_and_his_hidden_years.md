The popular narrative of Jesus's life, particularly the period between his childhood and public ministry, leaves a significant gap that is explored through various spiritual revelations and ancient texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. These insights offer alternative perspectives on his upbringing, travels, and the nature of his teachings.

## The Unaccounted Years (Ages 14-20)

The Bible provides no mention of Jesus's life between the ages of 14 and 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. During this period, it is speculated that he traveled to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Such information is considered a spiritual revelation, gathered from "annals of the spiritual age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. While not verifiable as absolute truth, these insights are viewed with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### The Missing Gospels and Canonical Selection
The selection of the Gospels we know today was a deliberate process by early Catholic priests. Approximately 4,000 Gospels existed in the 4th century available to Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. After Christianity became the Roman Empire's state religion under Constantine, these texts were sifted through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Constantine's mother, Helena, influenced his conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

Jerome, a polemicist from Alexandria, was hired by Damasus, the first Pope, to translate thousands of Aramaic and Greek manuscripts into Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. His task was to distinguish what would be officially accepted by the Catholic Church from what would be considered heresy or apocryphal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This process omitted all existing reports about Jesus's life before his public ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, including accounts of his travels to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### Childhood Curiosity and "Hackman"
The Bible mentions an incident when Jesus was approximately 9-11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. During a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Mary and Joseph realized Jesus was missing and found him three days later in the Sanhedrin, listening to doctors of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. When admonished by Mary, Jesus replied that he came to take care of his "father's interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Spiritual accounts suggest Jesus asked about a figure named "Hackman" mentioned in the Book of Wisdom of Solomon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:10]</a>. He questioned how Hackman could "fix some things that God had done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>, implying a knowledge beyond his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This "Hackman" later became the cosmic entity from whom Jesus's genome was borrowed for his artificial insemination in Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>, who was a virgin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

### Joseph of Arimathea and Jesus's Travels
Joseph, Jesus's father, was a carpenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a> whose main client was Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy Jewish-Roman citizen with tin mines and trade caravans spanning the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Joseph of Arimathea was also a scholar of mysteries beyond Jewish traditions, including Greco-Roman culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

After Joseph (Jesus's father) died, Joseph of Arimathea convinced Mary to let Jesus, then around 16-17 years old, manage his caravans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. This allowed Jesus to travel to various places like Persia, India, and Egypt until he was 24-25, seeking answers to the questions no one could answer in Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. He also visited ancient Gaul (today's France), as Mary's ancestors were descendants of the Benj Gala Tribe from that region, who had migrated to Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

## The Three Faces of Jesus

Beyond the Gospels selected by the Catholic Church, spiritual revelations present three distinct "faces" of Jesus:

1.  **Jesus the Galilean**: After Jesus's crucifixion, the apostles (excluding Judas Iscariot, who was from Judea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>) gathered in Jerusalem and intended Jesus's message to be passed only to Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This version of Jesus was the one they knew as the Galilean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Jesus the Christ (Marvel Superstar)**: Jesus, after his resurrection, appeared to Saul of Tarsus (who persecuted Christians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. Saul, becoming Paul, then began announcing Jesus to the rest of the world, contrary to the apostles' plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>. Paul created the figure of "Jesus the Christ," a term Jesus never used during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. Paul introduced concepts like salvation and justification by faith, which Jesus never spoke of, contrasting with Jesus's teaching that rewards were based on works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Jesus the Living One**: The resurrected Jesus also appeared to Mary Magdalene, who organized a group of about 100 disciples (more educated Jews who spoke Greek) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. Through her, Jesus began to give new revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. Mary Magdalene was a significant exponent of early Christianity, but the Catholic Church, in the 4th century, deliberately removed her influence and related texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

### Suppression of Mary Magdalene's Revelations and [[biblical_interpretations_and_gnostic_perspectives | Gnostic Perspectives]]
The teachings revealed through Mary Magdalene were suppressed because they contained "strange things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. For example, Jesus stated that those who seek and find the truth will be "stunned" and "balanced out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>, not joyful. This implies shocking truths about the Biblical God. The disciples with Mary Magdalene, who spoke Greek, adopted Plato's term "Demiurge" to refer to the God of the Jews, whom Jesus called "Abba" (Father) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. This marked the emergence of Gnosticism, which emphasizes "true knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. While Jesus never called Yahweh the devil, some Gnostics later did, leading to their hatred of Yahweh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.

In 325 CE, Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, aiming to transform Christianity into Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. Here, the myth of the Holy Trinity was created to de-emphasize the human aspect of Jesus, making him equal to God, and to distance the new religion from the God of the Jews (Yahweh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>. The concept of the Holy Spirit was also introduced, a figure Jesus never explicitly spoke of as himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>.

### The Lost Book of Enoch
The Catholic Church, under Pope Damasus and Jerome in the 4th century, removed the Book of Enoch from the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. This book was considered more important than others because it stated that Jesus was merely fulfilling an agenda Enoch received from Yahweh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. Enoch, a patriarch, had announced the future coming of the Messiah and explained the cosmogony of the time, holding greater weight than other prophets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. This removal served to diminish Jewish myths and consolidate Christian religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.

### Nag Hammadi Library
In 376 CE, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria decreed the destruction of all Gnostic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>. Monks at the Monastery of St. Pachomius in Egypt, who were translating Mary Magdalene's writings from Greek to Coptic, hid hundreds of these manuscripts in caves in the 6th century to prevent their burning by the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>. These texts, known today as the Nag Hammadi Library, were discovered in 1945, two years before the Dead Sea Scrolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. These findings contain the suppressed books of Mary Magdalene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>.

## The Transfiguration and Jesus's Mission
During his ministry, Jesus was pressured to use his "superpowers" to liberate Jews from the Roman Empire and establish a Jewish empire on Earth, forcing humanity to obey Yahweh's commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. However, Jesus maintained that his "kingdom is not of this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

The incident of Jesus's Transfiguration on Mount Tabor, described in Gospels, reveals a pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. Spiritual accounts clarify that angels and other beings, including "Hackman," held a reserved colloquium with Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. They urged him to use his powers as intended by Yahweh, warning that if he didn't, he would be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. Jesus refused to be a "violent Messiah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>, asserting his human nature wouldn't allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

At this point, Jesus transfigured, becoming like the angels, and spoke to them in a "Capela language" to assert the human self's dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. After this meeting, Jesus began to tell his apostles for the first time that he would die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>, and that he would resurrect three days later and return in his "glorious form" as Hackman, not with a human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

### The Descent into Hell
The Gnostic Gospel of Bartholomew describes Jesus's actions during his crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Bartholomew recounts seeing Jesus disappear from the cross and later reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. Jesus explained that he took "500 steps towards hell" to speak with Hades and Belial (Baal), the "owners of hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. His mission was to free the souls of humans imprisoned by these figures since the time of Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. From his sacrifice onward, disembodied human spirits could go to spirituality directly, rather than being stuck in lower levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Divinity and Evil

### The Problematic Nature of God
From a spiritual perspective, the God of the Bible, Yahweh, is viewed as a "crazy God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. The idea that God sent his "only son as a Lamb to pay with his blood the sins of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a> is deemed irrational, as a truly omnipotent and omniscient God would not need such sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. This challenges the Catholic dogma that emphasizes the Church's interpretation of God's word over individual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.

### Mythology's Explanation of Evil
Mythologies offer a different explanation for evil, asserting that it originates from the creator himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. This "fallen creator" (often paralleled with Yahweh or Brahma) made a mistake during creation, resulting in an imperfect universe and a being that is "reconstructed in the inner part of the universe that he created in the worst possible way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This "fall" was unintentional, a "mistake without malice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>, but it corrupted the original code, influencing human genome with defects and the drive to survive at any cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>.

Religions, by contrast, created a new myth: that God is perfect, and humans are "sinners" or the "disease of life" due to "original sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>. This narrative justifies practices like infant baptism, framing it as a necessity to cleanse babies of the sin inherited from Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.

### The Invention of the Devil and Angels
The figures of Lucifer and Satan are considered inventions of theology, though other beings exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:37">[01:50:37]</a>. The concept of an evil figure existed in ancient mythologies but was not personified as purely evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>. The more defined "devil" figure, specifically Baphomet, emerged from a political maneuver involving the Templars.

*   **Templars and Baphomet**: In the 11th-13th centuries, the Templars sought to separate the historical Jesus from Judaism, rescue ancient manuscripts (like those of Mary Magdalene), and create a unified Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. They also lent money to kings without interest, threatening the power of the Vatican and King Philip IV of France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. The Templars honored a "great head of wisdom," linked to the Kabbalah's "Chokmah," a personification of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This head was known as "Baphomet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. To discredit the Templars, the Church branded Baphomet as the devil, explaining why the devil is often depicted with horns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This manipulation led to the widespread belief in the Devil within Catholicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

*   **Angels as Robotic Clones**: According to mythological interpretations, angels are "robotic beings," "clones" of Yahweh, created from the scattered parts of his mind after his "fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>. They lack individuality and merely obey Yahweh, similar to worker bees obeying a queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. The term "angel" appeared in Babylonian culture and was assimilated into Jewish thought during their captivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>. There are no inherently "good" or "evil" angels; they are devoid of emotions, good humor, or a sense of fear, simply executing orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>.

## Human Existence, Reincarnation, and the Afterlife

Humans are described as "corrupt monstrosities" but also capable of great compassion and self-sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>. Unlike robotic angels, humans possess free will, allowing for the most monstrous or beautiful expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:38">[02:34:38]</a>.

### The Self and the Afterlife
When the physical body dies, the "self" (the accumulation of emotional stickers, memories, and feelings) continues to exist uninterruptedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>. This self is not the soul but is hosted within the spiritual body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>.

After death, a "movie" of all memories plays, and if unresolved attachments or negative files remain, the self can get stuck in a "mental loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26">[02:00:26]</a>. This explains the concept of "lost souls" or "backrests" who feed on the "effluvia" of humans engaged in vices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>. If a self has no unresolved issues, it enters a state of "enchantment," transported to a spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:29">[02:02:29]</a>.

### Reincarnation and Karma
Human beings are comprised of seven bodies: a physical body, three "phantasms" (etheric double, emotional/sentimental body, and mental body) forming the "lower quaternary," and three higher spiritual bodies (Atmic, Buddhic, Manasic) forming the "Immortal Triad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>.

Reincarnation occurs when the three lower bodies do not fully die upon physical death, carrying "dirty code" or negative files from previous lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. The Immortal Triad (spirit) then produces new bodies to resolve this corrupted code, leading to repeated incarnations until the issues are cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. Human existence is described as a "brutal mess" and a "selfish need" rather than an act of love, as spirits are compelled to create new human beings to resolve their karmic baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>.

Humans are born within an "incarnational program," limited by past life experiences, but possess free will within these predetermined boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>. The "agam" (or agm) is the way one faces these predetermined challenges, offering an opportunity to resolve karma within a single life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:08">[02:17:08]</a>.

## Prophecies and the Dystopian Present
Humanity is currently in a "dystopian time" because problems are accumulated across all areas of life, with the expectation that God will resolve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:33">[02:17:33]</a>. This belief in a "personal God" who caters to whims is seen as a "shame" and a "misuse" of the concept of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:30">[02:17:30]</a>. The speaker argues that human faith often relies on irrationality and external salvation rather than internal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

The world faces severe challenges:
*   **Environmental problems**: Nature does not forgive human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:10">[02:18:10]</a>.
*   **Financial collapse**: An impending "great reset" will worsen the global situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:17">[02:18:17]</a>.
*   **Wealth concentration**: 1% of humans control the planetary wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:31">[02:18:31]</a>.
*   **Corporate dominance**: The world is moving towards a "Blade Runner" scenario, controlled by mega-corporations and autonomous artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:43">[02:18:43]</a>.
*   **Nuclear threats**: New conservatives in the US advocate for nuclear war, believing they can destroy adversaries before being destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:31">[02:19:31]</a>.
*   **Biological threats**: Viruses like Toxoplasma gondii and COVID-19 are described as deliberately "imbecilizing" humans, akin to how Toxoplasma manipulates rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:10">[02:23:10]</a>. These viruses affect human brains and personality, and their ultimate purpose for humans remains unknown to scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a>. This biological warfare could be part of an ancient plan by beings from a neighboring universe to "dehumanize" or "dominate" Earth, as their own universe is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.

These issues signify that humanity has collected "the worst results," and there is "no way to have good results" without confronting humanity's "own mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>. Wisdom, it is suggested, will come through suffering and apprenticeship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>.

## Ancient Mysteries and [[the_relationship_between_religion_and_hidden_knowledge | Extraterrestrial Influence]]

Megalithic structures like the pyramids of Egypt and the Nazca drawings are presented as evidence of [[the_relationship_between_religion_and_hidden_knowledge | extraterrestrial influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. These constructions were built by non-human beings from other planets or universes.

### The Legend of the Seven Sages Builders
Around 14,000 years ago, after a great cataclysm that shifted the Earth's crust, descendants from a supercontinent called Hyperborea (or Thule) and Lemuria spread across the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:31">[02:40:31]</a>. These "Seven Sages Builders" undertook the mission to construct megalithic buildings worldwide to resist future cataclysms and leave messages for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

*   **Giza Pyramids and Orion's Belt**: Robert Bauval, an Egyptologist, noted that the misalignment of the three Giza pyramids precisely matches the misalignment of the three stars in Orion's belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:31">[02:42:31]</a>. Computer programs confirm that this alignment occurred approximately 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:04">[02:44:04]</a>.
*   **Sphinx and Leo Constellation**: The Sphinx in Egypt is similarly aligned with the constellation of Leo, corresponding to the same period 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Angkor Wat and Draco Constellation**: The 18-19 temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia align perfectly with the stars of the Draco constellation, also dating back to approximately 12,450 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:32">[02:44:32]</a>.

These precise astronomical alignments, matching distant past celestial configurations, suggest that the builders had advanced knowledge and explicitly encoded messages for humanity. However, much of what is written in ancient texts remains undeciphered, for example, over 1500 Jain manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>.

### The Dogons and Sirius
The Dogon people of Mali, Africa, possess knowledge of a three-star Sirius system (Sirius A, a white dwarf Sirius B, and a brown dwarf Sirius C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. They claim their ancestors came from a planet orbiting Sirius C and that the three pyramids of Egypt represent the mass and volume ratios of these three stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:37">[02:49:37]</a>. This knowledge predates modern astronomical discoveries of Sirius B (1990s) and C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>. This corroborates the idea that humanity was created or influenced by non-human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>.

Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense, explicitly stated that aliens exist and he knows of four species, underscoring the suppression of this truth from humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>.

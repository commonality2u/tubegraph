The program "Limited Intelligence" explores various [[prophetic_visions_and_endtimes_prophecy | apocalyptic]] themes, with guests Daniel Mastral and Daniel Lopes sharing their perspectives on [[interpretations_of_biblical_prophecy_and_the_end_times | biblical prophecy]] and current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Daniel Mastral is a writer and lecturer, having authored 25 books and teaching on platforms where he can speak freely on topics like the end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Daniel Lopes is a journalist with a YouTube channel focusing on international news and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Unsealing Prophecies for the End Times

Daniel Mastral believes that biblical prophecies, such as those in Daniel 12, which state that certain words would be sealed until the end of time, are now meant to be understood by the wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He emphasizes that while only God knows the exact timing, observing signs and fulfilled prophecies can provide insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

The concept of tribulation is explained as a 7-year period, divided into two halves: tribulation and great tribulation, each lasting three and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. There are different [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | interpretations of eschatology]], including pre-tribulationism, which suggests that the chosen will be raptured before this period begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Mastral, however, argues that the church needs to undergo a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Signs and Allegories from the Bible

Jesus provided several clues in Matthew 24, including the parable of the fig tree, which alludes to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. The cooling of love, increased mistreatment, a "second rebellion," earthquakes, health crises, and celestial tremors are all mentioned as signs of the "beginning of sorrows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Recent global earthquakes, including a significant one in New York, are cited as modern fulfillments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

A crucial clue is the statement, "This generation will not pass without these things happening," interpreted as a biblical generation of 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Israel was founded on May 14, 1948, completing 70 years on May 14, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

## Modern Events and Prophetic Connections

### The Number 9 and Donald Trump

The number 9 holds significance in high magic and cabalistic traditions, representing Lucifer's nine stones or crystals mentioned in Ezekiel 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. The 45th U.S. President, Donald Trump (4+5=9), is seen as a figure aligning with these numerical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Trump's decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem in 2018 is considered to have had a profound spiritual impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Trump is viewed as potentially representing the first Horseman of the Apocalypse, the White Horse, who brings false peace through diplomacy, possessing power but initially without arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

### Astrological and Celestial Signs

[[role_and_interpretation_of_biblical_prophecies | Biblical prophecies]] encourage observing the skies for signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The phenomenon of four Blood Moons in 2014-2015, coinciding with important Jewish festivals, is highlighted as a rare astrological event signaling the stage being set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

Recent events like NASA discussing UFOs and calling theologians to debate the phenomenon are interpreted as preparing the public for a "fake apocalypse" or alien abduction narrative to explain disappearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. The name of NASA's project to study the ionosphere during the recent eclipse, "Apep" (a nickname for Apophis, the Egyptian god of darkness and chaos), is seen as a significant symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. The visibility of the "devil's comet" during the eclipse is another astrological sign noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a>.

### Global Elite and the New World Order

The concept of a "New World Order" is discussed, influenced by groups like the Bilderberg Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. These groups aim to control the future, using media like movies to prepare the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

The year 2023 is noted as the hottest and most violent year since World War II, alongside widespread dengue and other climate anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:24">[02:06:24]</a>. The Pentagon's CONOP 8888, a contingency plan for a zombie apocalypse, is publicly available and points to thawed bacteria potentially lodging in the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence and the Mark of the Beast

The 2030 Agenda is connected to [[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | biblical prophecies]] about control and a "mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. It's suggested that a "biochip" or "mark" will be implemented, specifically on the forehead, preventing those without it from buying, selling, or transferring anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:20">[02:08:20]</a>. This aligns with biblical descriptions of the "mark of the beast" and its image speaking like artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:36">[01:43:36]</a>. Elon Musk's prediction of a billion robots by 2040, capable of war, is also highlighted as a worrying development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

### World Conflict and Spiritual War

The speaker asserts that a Third World War is inevitable, citing Trump's statement that he is the only one who can prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. The war will involve new, terrifying weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

The recent Israel-Hamas conflict is seen as a catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. The attack on Israel coincided with a "rave" on holy ground and was possibly predicted by The Economist magazine's 2012 cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. The desire to rebuild the Third Temple in Jerusalem is seen as a justification for conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. The ongoing month of Ramadan, ending on April 10th, and the subsequent "Ninah" year are identified as key periods for potential attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

A ritual performed on October 31, 2023, to open "dimensional portals" for "territorial spirits" is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. The release of demons from the Euphrates River and the rise of Abaddon (the Destroyer) and Apollyon are mentioned, connecting to a spiritual war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

The [[Interpretations of Revelation | Book of Revelation]] describes the "fourth Knight" on a pale (yellow) horse, representing death and plague diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>. The recent pandemic is seen as a "rehearsal" for worse plagues to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.

## Surviving the Times

The importance of spiritual preparation is emphasized, including seeking God, repenting, and practicing love and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. Practical advice is also given, such as storing food and choosing safe locations away from major cities, referencing the book "Strategic Relocation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Financial preparedness includes having physical money, as digital systems could fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:46">[02:06:46]</a>. The discussion highlights the dangers of relying solely on modern infrastructure and the need to be self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:19">[02:00:19]</a>.

## Miscellaneous Prophetic Mentions

*   **The 144,000**: Described as 144,000 Jews who did not receive the mark of the beast, receiving spiritual protection and a role in preaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:16">[02:42:16]</a>. The number is also seen as 12x12 (12 tribes of Israel x 12 apostles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **666**: Interpreted as a desecration of the Trinity, representing humanity's attempt to deify itself, fulfilling the serpent's promise to Eve to "be like God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:14">[02:47:14]</a>. This is linked to transhumanism and the idea of humans mixing with machines to become "immortals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>.
*   **The "Last Pope" Prophecy**: The current Pope Francis is considered the seventh, with the next likely being the "eighth king" who will support the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>. This is tied to a Jesuit priest, Malachi Martin, who wrote about satanic rituals in the Vatican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.

From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

A historic podcast brings together a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Pastor to explore commonalities and differences across their respective faiths, aiming to expand knowledge and bridge understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The dialogue seeks to identify shared aspects of their religions while acknowledging unique traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Initial Introductions and Shared Experiences

The hosts express excitement for the "historic night" bringing together a Rabbi, Priest, and Pastor, promising "unlimited intelligence" from their guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The atmosphere is one of camaraderie and mutual respect, with jokes about "useless gifts" and shared academic experiences, such as having the same master's supervisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### The Virgin Mary and Theological Nuances

A significant point of [[comparative_religion_christianity_judaism_and_catholicism | comparative religion]] arises in the discussion of the Virgin Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The priest notes a book given to a pastor about a Jewish Mary, highlighting the shared lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A historical anecdote recalls a Marist Professor discussing Mary's virginity:
*   The First Level: Generally accepted virginity of Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   The Third Level: Mary remained a virgin after childbirth (not discussed in depth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   The Second Level: Mary remained a virgin *during* childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This doctrine is defended by Adventists, who interpret the Bible literally, believing Mary, being without sin, would not have experienced childbirth pains like Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This surprising defense of a Catholic dogma by a Protestant pastor highlights unexpected points of agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Dialogue vs. Ecumenism

The participants clarify the difference between inter-religious dialogue and ecumenism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While ecumenism involves official church unification, their discussion represents dialogueâ€”a space for shared understanding without aiming for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The goal is not for the pastor to become Catholic or the priest to become Jewish, but to find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## The Concept of God

All three guests agree that they share the same God, the Creator of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This shared belief fosters a sense of brotherhood among all human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

> [!quote] The God of Abraham
> The faith God gave to Abraham was so vast that "the God of Abraham could not be alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The God of Israel is not solely for Israel, as God promised Abraham that "all peoples of the earth" would be blessed through him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

The Jewish perspective emphasizes God as the omnipotent, infinite light, often beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. True faith involves experiencing God even when one doesn't fully understand His ways, trusting in a greater force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

The Christian perspective, as articulated by the priest, emphasizes God's loving presence: "I am with you," "I am in the midst of you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This divine presence is seen in creation, in miraculous signs, and supremely in the incarnation of the Word becoming flesh (Jesus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. The concept of the Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) illustrates God as a communion, a multiplicity within unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

## Faith, Intelligence, and Autonomy

[[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | Influence of Spirituality and Faith]] is crucial. The Latin root of "intelligence," *intus legere*, means "to read inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This suggests that faith is not the opposite of intelligence, but rather a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. An intelligent faith stands in contrast to fundamentalism, which hides in the "basement" and refuses to engage with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

There are two types of faith discussed:
*   **Doctrinal Faith (Fides Quae):** Belief in specific dogmas or doctrines (e.g., fasting on Yom Kippur, the Eucharist, keeping the Sabbath) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. These are the "codes of truth" that define a belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.
*   **Relational Faith (Fides Qua):** A personal relationship with the Creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>. Doctrinal faith only holds meaning if it is rooted in this personal relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>.

> [!info] Personal Conviction and Respect
> The speaker emphasizes the importance of having one's own conviction, not practicing a religion merely "by custom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:42">[03:36:42]</a>. One should be able to explain *why* they are Adventist and not a Jehovah's Witness, or Jewish and not Muslim, or a priest and not a pastor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>. This conviction should never deny one's own beliefs but always respect the sacredness of another's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

The ability to dialog intelligently finds confluence, creating unity and communion even amidst doctrinal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28">[02:17:28]</a>. The podcast itself serves as an example of finding common ground in "confluence fields" even when "dots" for technical discussion remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.

## Respect and Understanding in Practice

Examples of mutual respect were shared:
*   A Catholic seminary accommodated the Adventist pastor's dietary restrictions, removing pork bacon from beans when he was visiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:36">[03:37:36]</a>.
*   An Adventist school allowed a student to skip Sunday activities for church programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:19">[03:38:19]</a>.
*   [[cultural_and_spiritual_perspectives_on_the_jewish_identity | A Rabbi]] recounted how a priest told a Jewish student to "continue being Jewish" rather than converting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:52">[03:51:52]</a>.

These instances demonstrate that despite [[challenges_and_controversies_in_modern_religious_practice | challenges and controversies]], respect for one's faith can foster positive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:18">[03:38:18]</a>.

## Prophecy, Eschatology, and the End Times

The concept of end times is a significant point of discussion within [[religious_and_philosophical_discussions_on_current_global_issues | religious and philosophical discussions]].
*   **Jewish View:** Judaism awaits the coming of the Messiah (Mashiah) who will rebuild the Third Temple, gather Jews to Israel, and bring world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>. The Messiah will be an extremely wise descendant of King David, announced by Prophet Elijah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:41">[03:12:41]</a>.
*   **Christian (Adventist) View:** Adventists believe in two comings of the Messiah: the first as a humble donkey (Jesus of Nazareth) and the second, awaited return, in glory and majesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:53">[03:01:53]</a>. This "parousia" (second coming of Christ) is a core Christian faith, shared by Catholics as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>.
*   **Common Ground:** The shared "longing for Paradise" or "hunger for happiness" is a profound commonality across the faiths, representing an innate desire to return to an original state of perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:29">[03:33:29]</a>.

## Archaeology and Biblical Proofs

The discussion touches on archaeological discoveries that support biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>. The Adventist pastor manages a museum with over 2,000 original pieces, including a brick from Babylon inscribed by Nebuchadnezzar, dating back to the time of Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. This artifact, personally read by Daniel during the Babylonian captivity, now serves as a testament to the biblical story in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>. Other evidence includes Egyptian papyri reporting plagues similar to those in Exodus, such as the Nile turning to blood and widespread darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a>. These discoveries illustrate how science can explore the "infinite wisdom of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Misconceptions in Faith Practice

[[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_faith_practice | Challenges and misconceptions in faith practice]] are acknowledged. Proselytism, in its negative sense of coercing conversion, is rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:39">[03:03:39]</a>. Instead, the concept of "witnessing" is preferred: enthusiastically sharing one's belief without judging the sincerity of others based on agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:25">[03:06:25]</a>.

> [!warning] Avoiding Generalizations
> The speakers stress the importance of not generalizing negative experiences to entire religious groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:59">[03:23:59]</a>. Individual imperfections should not define a whole faith; there are "bad Jews," "bad Catholics," and "bad Adventists," but their existence does not invalidate the faith itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.

## The Importance of Education and Connection

Religious education, beyond just teaching codes of belief, should foster "religious sensitivity" and "reconnection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:17">[03:21:17]</a>. This means reconnecting with heaven, with God, with others, and with the Earth, combating individualism and separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:31">[03:21:31]</a>.

> [!tip] The Hunger for Happiness
> A recurring theme is the human "hunger for happiness," described as a "longing for Paradise" or an "unconscious memory" of a perfect place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. True happiness is an internal state, not dependent on external achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. The secret to sustained happiness is not getting used to the good things, but continually appreciating the "smallest details" and daily miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>.

The dialogue concludes with a reaffirmation of unity and shared values, despite doctrinal differences, emphasizing the importance of peace, respect, and mutual understanding for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

Whindersson Nunes reflects on his unique path into comedy, detailing his childhood influences, the evolution of his career, personal challenges, and future projects.

## Early Life and Creative Beginnings

Growing up, Whindersson Nunes was drawn to creative pursuits, often finding ways to play with broken toys or asking "why" about the world around him, including how actors on television spoke different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:48">[10:32:48]</a>. His childhood home in Santa Luz, Piauí, a very remote area without running water, electricity, or paved roads, limited his access to modern entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:55">[11:53:55]</a>. Instead, he read books on geography, chemistry, and math left by his uncle, and three *Turma da Mônica* comic books, which he knew by heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:07">[12:42:07]</a>.

Music played a significant role, as his grandmother's radio, powered by batteries, would play hits from artists like Felipe Dylon, Michael Jackson, and Pepe Moreno <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:11">[13:11:11]</a>. With limited information, Whindersson even imagined these artists were in a fierce competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:26">[14:25:26]</a>. He also enjoyed drawing, encouraged by his father who bought him notebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:03">[16:03:03]</a>.

He also shares his experience with an evangelical church, which he began attending with a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. He appreciated the music, atmosphere, and the community's good intentions, noting how they would collectively help build houses for those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:14">[17:13:14]</a>.

## Entry into Comedy and YouTube

Whindersson's entry into comedy was organic, with friends often inviting him to make videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. His first stand-up show in São Paulo was for only 14 people at a bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Initially, he wasn't nervous on stage, but subsequent performances made him shake, forcing him to remove his cell phone to hide his trembling hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. He later found his rhythm, comparing it to playing the guitar after a long break, feeling even more proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:05">[05:42:05]</a>.

His initial contact with televised stand-up performances came after his father got a job, allowing them to afford a TV package. He first saw performances by Paulo Vieira, Patrick Maia, Danilo Gentili, and Rafinha Bastos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>. He also followed local comedians from Piauí like Dirceu Andrade and Amauri Jucá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>.

Whindersson's YouTube channel began in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>, but was hacked and deleted. He restarted it, quickly regaining his 35,000 to 40,000 subscribers with help from campaigns by other YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>. He initially didn't monetize his videos, only realizing its potential later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. His first earnings were R$600, which jumped to R$8,000, signaling to him that hard work would lead to more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>.

## Career Evolution and Challenges

In his early career, Whindersson moved to Teresina, staying at a friend's house for six months, initially planning for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>. He bought his first camera, a Nikon P510, by working other jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>. He recognized YouTube as a real opportunity when he saw others earning money from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:25:00">[47:25:00]</a>.

His comedic style evolved from caricatures to storytelling, where he found himself naturally incorporating personal narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>. He found it easier to construct jokes by following a timeline of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>.

Whindersson has performed internationally, noting that shows outside Brazil are often a "lottery" regarding audience turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. He performed for 2,500 people in New York but only 250 in another city where 1,400 were expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. He has performed in at least 20 countries since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. When performing in smaller venues, the close proximity to the audience makes him more nervous, as every reaction is highly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

He acknowledges that fame changes how people perceive him, transitioning from a regular person to an "artist" when recognized in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:47:00">[52:47:00]</a>.

## Personal Life and Reflections

Whindersson shared the joyous news of his fiancée, Maria, being pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. Maria surprised him with the news, hiding the pregnancy test until he returned from training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. He expressed deep emotion, crying upon learning he would be a father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. He believes a woman becomes a mother the moment she discovers her pregnancy, while a man truly becomes a father when the child is born and he holds them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.

He reflected on childhood near-death experiences, including almost drowning and getting an electric shock from exposed wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>. He stated that watching news about children in danger now makes him paranoid as a future father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>.

Whindersson openly discussed his struggles with mental health, noting that 2020 was a "heavy" year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. He experienced a period of deep sadness and difficulty leaving bed, which he suspects might have been depression, though he never sought a diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>. He stresses the importance of seeking professional help for mental health, comparing it to treating an open wound that needs to be closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:03">[02:12:03]</a>. He eventually sought therapy when he realized he didn't want to continue feeling unwell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>.

## Future Projects and Philosophy

Whindersson Nunes has several film projects in the works, including a horror film about a doll named Euclides and a horror-comedy akin to *Ted* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. He is also developing an animated series called "My Owner is Famous," which will follow the life of a street dog adopted by a Brazilian celebrity, offering a dog's perspective on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>.

He is working on a historical project, possibly a film, about the Battle of Jenipapo, a lesser-known battle in Piauí that significantly impacted Brazil's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. The story will follow three artists who sought to avoid the war, with the historical events playing out in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of telling untold stories and challenges the traditional education system for focusing on certain historical narratives while ignoring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

Whindersson believes that life is about finding solutions and being creative, defining "art" as any makeshift solution to a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He believes people often suppress their creativity, pushing them towards conventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. He views his life as a series of connected dots, where past experiences, even seemingly random ones, contribute to his present path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Regarding life after death, he believes there is "something else" and expresses hope for a continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:31">[02:28:31]</a>. He also shares a philosophy about money, seeing it as merely "paper" that people assign value to, leading to societal complexities and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.

## Reflections on Career and Fame

Whindersson considers his Miami show to be the "show of his life" due to the audience's overwhelming eagerness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>. He likens the experience to feeling "like Kevin Hart" in the United States, who once performed for 53,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>. He enjoys playing with the "wave" of laughter that spreads through a large crowd, creating a contagious atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>.

He acknowledges that his rapid rise to fame has been a significant challenge, forcing him to adapt quickly to public life and constant scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:15">[02:24:15]</a>. He finds it difficult to ignore negative comments, but strives to focus on the positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>.

Whindersson encourages aspiring artists not to be afraid of facing problems or criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:08">[02:15:08]</a>. He emphasizes that if one has a passion and is good at something, they should pursue it despite external negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:32">[02:15:32]</a>.

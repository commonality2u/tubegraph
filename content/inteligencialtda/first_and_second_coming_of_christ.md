The concept of the coming of Christ, encompassing both his historical incarnation and his promised future return, is central to Christian theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. This discussion delves into the nature of Christ before his birth, the significance of his first coming, and the prophesied events surrounding his second coming.

## The Pre-Incarnate Christ: Eternal God and Creator

Before his birth, Christ was already eternal God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. He is referred to as the Word, or the Logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **The Word as God** In the first chapter of John, it states: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The Greek word "Logos" signifies the very essence and action of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **Role in Creation** All things were made through Christ, and without him, nothing that was made came into being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. God the Father is depicted as the architect, conceiving creation, which then occurred through the Word (Jesus), with the Holy Spirit supervising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. The plural "Elohim" (Gods) in Genesis 1:1, and the phrase "Let us make man in our image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, indicate the Trinity's joint action in creation (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Distinction from Created Beings** Christ was never created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Unlike angels, who were created beings, the "angel of the Lord" mentioned in the Old Testament is not a created entity and accepts worship, unlike created angels who refuse it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Examples include the burning bush encounter with Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a> and Joshua's apparition before Jericho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:29]</a>.

## The Eternal Plan: God's Unconditional Love

Christ's incarnation was decided in eternity, not as a reaction to humanity's fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. God, being eternal and omniscient, knew man would fall and would need a Redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

*   **The Lamb Slain Before Time** Revelation 13:8 speaks of "the lamb that was slain since the foundation of the Cosmos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. This means Jesus' death was already planned in eternity, even before his physical birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
*   **Unconditional Love** This pre-ordained sacrifice demonstrates God's incomprehensible, unconditional love, sending His Son to die for sinners even while they were still in their sinful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. God's nature *is* love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.
*   **Old Testament Foreshadowing** The entire Old Testament, through types, characters, and sacrificial animals, pointed to Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Isaac and Abraham:** Isaac's near-sacrifice by Abraham is considered a "type" of Christ, where God asked Abraham to give his only son, but ultimately provided a ram instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. This foreshadowed God's sacrifice of His own Son, Jesus, who would not be spared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>.
    *   **First Prophecy of the Messiah:** Genesis 3:15 contains the first prophecy of the Messiah, stating that the "descendant of the woman" (the Messiah) would crush the serpent's head, while the serpent would bite his heel (alluding to Christ's death on the cross and victory over evil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>.

## The First Coming: Incarnation, Ministry, and Sacrifice

Jesus came in the "fullness of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>, when the world was prepared for his arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.

### Historical Context and Prophecy Fulfillment
*   **Language and Roads:** The Hellenization of the world by Alexander the Great established Greek as a universal language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>, allowing the New Testament to be written and understood widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>. The Pax Romana ensured safe roads, facilitating the spread of the gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.
*   **Birth in Bethlehem:** The prophecy of Micah 5:2 foretold that the ruler of Israel would come from Bethlehem, a small city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Caesar Augustus's decree for a worldwide census required Joseph and Mary to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, fulfilling this prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.
*   **Virgin Birth:** Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that "the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (God with us) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. This was essential as sin is transmitted through the male line (Adam's disobedience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>, so Jesus, born of a virgin and without a human father, could be without sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>.

### Jesus' Ministry and Challenges
*   **Vanguard Leader:** Jesus was a man of the vanguard, challenging the strict legalism of his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>. He touched lepers, going against the law, demonstrating love and healing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.
*   **Sermon on the Mount:** On a mountain, reminiscent of Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai, Jesus established the "laws of the kingdom," promoting peace, humility, and love over traditional conquest and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>.
*   **Satan's Attempts:** Satan continuously tried to prevent Christ from fulfilling his purpose. From instigating Herod to kill infant boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:08">[03:51:08]</a>, to tempting Jesus in the desert for 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:08">[03:51:08]</a>, Satan sought to make him fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. However, Jesus resisted temptation and remained sinless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### The Sacrifice and Its Purpose
*   **Necessity of Death:** Jesus' death was not a failure or a political weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>; it was prophesied and necessary for salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>. He willingly gave his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   **Fulfillment of Passover:** Jesus died at Easter (Passover), at the time of the morning sacrifice, fulfilling the role of the Paschal Lamb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. Just as the lamb was examined for four days before sacrifice, Jesus was examined by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   **Atonement for Sin:** The Old Testament sacrifices, like the sprinkling of blood on the mercy seat, *covered* sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. Jesus' blood, however, not only covers but *destroys* sins, making believers "whiter than snow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. His death was a "once and for all" sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

## The Second Coming: Prophecy and Future Events

Jesus promised his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, and this is a significant aspect of [[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | biblical prophecy]].

### Signs of the Times
*   **Observation, Not Prediction:** While no one knows the exact "day or hour" of his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>, Jesus instructed believers to observe the "times and seasons" and the signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.
*   **Global Catastrophes:** The present era sees an unprecedented convergence of signs, including natural disasters like fires, earthquakes, and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>.
*   **Revival of Israel:** Ezekiel 36-37 prophesied the return of the Jewish people to their land from all nations, a prophecy fulfilled in 1948 with the establishment of modern Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>. The vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel 37) is seen as a representation of the Holocaust and Israel's subsequent rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **The Dead Sea:** Ezekiel's prophecy also states that the Dead Sea would become fresh again in its northern part, supporting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:54">[01:36:54]</a>. This is observed today with the appearance of freshwater craters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Shifts:** Ezekiel 38-39 speaks of nations like Russia (Magog) and Iran (Persia) turning against Israel, a future event despite current alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.
*   **Technological Control:** The rapid advancement of technology, such as brain chips and global "super apps," points towards a future of centralized control, potentially paving the way for the mark of the beast mentioned in Revelation (e.g., the 666 being interpreted as 'www' in Hebrew) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:33">[01:50:33]</a>.

### Sequence of Events
*   **The Rapture:** This is the next major event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>, where believers, both resurrected dead and living, will meet the Lord "in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. This is an invisible event, distinct from the second coming.
*   **The Great Tribulation:** A 7-year period following the rapture, marked by intense global suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
    *   **The [[interpretations_of_the_antichrist | Antichrist]]**: A political leader who will gain global power during the tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:50">[01:56:50]</a>. Some prominent figures in tech and politics are sometimes considered as potential "apostles" of the antichrist, preparing the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:25">[01:56:25]</a>.
    *   **The False Prophet:** A powerful religious leader, likened to a lamb with two horns, who will direct global worship towards the [[interpretations_of_the_antichrist | Antichrist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32">[01:57:32]</a>.
    *   **The Satanic Trinity:** Comprised of Satan (the Anti-God), the [[interpretations_of_the_antichrist | Antichrist]], and the False Prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:35">[01:49:35]</a>.
*   **The Second Coming (Visible Return):** At the end of the 7-year tribulation, Jesus will return visibly to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>, ending the reign of the [[interpretations_of_the_antichrist | Antichrist]] and destroying his armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. He comes as a judge, the "lion of the tribe of Judah," in contrast to his first coming as the sacrificial "Lamb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[02:03:38]</a>.
*   **The Millennium:** A 1,000-year period of peace and prosperity where Christ will rule the earth with justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>. Satan will be imprisoned, and sin will be greatly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:26">[02:17:26]</a>. At the end of this period, Satan will be released for a final test, leading to a final battle and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>.
*   **Eternal State:** After the final judgment, those who accepted God will enter eternal joy in His presence, while those who did not will be eternally separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The "Lake of Fire" (Gehenna) is the definitive eternal hell, distinct from Hades/Sheol, which are temporary holding places for the dead awaiting final judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.

## Conclusion: Living with Hope and Love

The message of Christ's comings emphasizes His central role in the gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>. He is not merely a historical figure or an admirable person, but the origin, destiny, Lord, and Savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:14">[02:32:14]</a>. Believers are encouraged to love and embrace the second coming, viewing it as a blessed hope, a wedding of the bride (the church) with the groom (Christ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. Faith, hope, and love are presented as the eternal powers that guide believers in this temporary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:34">[03:35:34]</a>.

Serjão embarked on a significant [[Weight Loss Journey]] prompted by personal health issues and a desire to influence his children positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This journey has involved a radical overhaul of his [[nutrition_and_dieting | diet]] and a commitment to [[bodybuilding_and_fitness | physical training]].

## Initial Motivation and Challenges
Serjão's motivation for losing weight stemmed from a severe knee problem, caused by being overweight, which made walking and moving difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. A doctor advised that knee surgery would be ineffective without significant weight loss, as the operation would fail if he remained overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Previous attempts at weight loss were hampered by negative experiences at gyms, where he faced mockery and stares, leading to demotivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He noted that many gyms seem to cater to those already in good shape, making it intimidating for overweight individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

A significant turning point came when he and his wife became concerned about their children's sedentary lifestyle, spending too much time on video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Realizing that leading by example was the only way, Serjão agreed to join a fitness project with Júlio and Cariane, but only if his children could participate as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This allowed him to address two major concerns simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## The Fitness Project
The project began when Cariane approached Serjão during a live stream, and he immediately agreed to participate if his children could join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. They train at a specialized "training center," distinct from a typical gym, where professional athletes like Zancanelli and Ramon Dino also train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Serjão initially feared his teenagers wouldn't enjoy training alongside such dedicated athletes, but they embraced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This positive engagement led to their school friends also becoming more active, creating a beneficial chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. He expresses daily gratitude to Júlio and Cariane, viewing them as "angels" who helped his family escape a sedentary path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The project is set to continue until the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Serjão currently trains three times a week but aims to intensify his routine to at least five times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Dietary Changes and [[Habit formation and deconstruction in dietary practices | Habit Formation]]
Serjão identified two major dietary challenges: a severe addiction to sugary soda (not even zero-sugar, but traditional full-sugar soda) and sweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. He described himself as a "crackhead" for soda, even going out late at night to buy it if the fridge was empty, and fighting with his wife if she didn't order soda with pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. His sweet addiction involved eating sweets multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

He radically cut out both, stating he is at a "radical level" where his meals consist primarily of salad and grilled chicken or fish fillet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. He avoids rice, French fries, and red meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. He replaced sugary soda with diet soda and is gradually decreasing his consumption of that too, focusing on drinking more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. He also practices eating slowly, which helps the brain register satiety and leads to eating less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. He uses protein-rich cereal bars as snacks to manage hunger and cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

## Progress and Results
Serjão's approach is to go "all in" with a radical mindset, leaving no room for excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. After one month, he lost 18 kg, dropping from 185 kg to 167 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. He notes the importance of understanding that while the scale might not always show drastic drops (due to muscle gain replacing fat), other results, like improved mood and disposition, are highly motivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. His long-term goal, set by Júlio, is to reach 100 kg within one year of starting the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

One of the most significant and immediate improvements has been the complete absence of knee pain, which was previously at its "maximum level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. His breathing and overall disposition have also significantly improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

## Adapting Routine and Future Outlook
Integrating intense training into a busy schedule required Serjão to [[navigating_personal_and_professional_challenges | reorganize his routine]] to avoid wasting time on "nonsense" and become more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. His typical day starts at 6 AM, including school drop-offs and work, with training sessions fitted in during the day with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. While he is still working on regulating his sleep, he emphasizes the importance of a supportive environment in achieving fitness goals, noting that his training center provides the necessary motivation from others with similar objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

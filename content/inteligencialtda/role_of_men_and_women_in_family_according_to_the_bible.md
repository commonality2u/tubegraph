## Importance and Attack on the Family

The family is considered the most attacked institution in modern times, with a global movement threatening [[the_role_and_influence_of_religion_in_family_life | Jewish Christian values]] and traditional family structures [01:58:28]. The state's desire to care for children and make decisions in place of parents is part of this threat [02:19:50]. There is an ideological push, seen in literature, performing arts, and entertainment, that aims to dilute the family unit, which traditionally upholds Christian morals and Jewish values [01:59:38]. This includes attempts to redefine sex, claiming it is an orientation rather than biology [02:00:29]. To protect the family, men are encouraged to fulfill their biblical roles and defend this institution from extinction [02:01:22].

## Role of Men

The main component of the family is the male figure, and men have faced a "gigantic discharge" to effeminate them and diminish their active voice in society [02:01:03]. To protect the family, men must fulfill four biblical functions, often referred to as the "Four P's": Prophet, Priest, Provider, and Protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:35">[02:01:35]</a>.

### Priest
As a priest, the man represents his family before God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:19">[02:02:19]</a>. He acts as an intercessor, bending his knees to pray for his wife and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>. He is responsible for spiritually guiding his home in the fear of the Lord, going to God during crises or when family members are suffering [02:02:32].

### Prophet
The man, as a prophet, goes to God, studies the scriptures, and communicates God's word to his wife and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. He is their teacher and is responsible for developing their salvation, teaching the Bible, and clarifying doubts biblically [02:03:17].

### Provider
The provider is responsible for supplying the family's basic needs, including housing, clothing, food, education, and medicine, to ensure a dignified life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:41">[02:03:41]</a>. The burden of provision rests on the man's back, as ordained by God after the Fall [02:04:21]. While women can work and complement the family income, the primary financial responsibility falls on the man [02:04:27]. This role emphasizes the need for men to study, work, and perfect their skills to provide adequately, especially as women increasingly dominate the job market [02:04:37].

### Protector
The protector stands between his family and danger, whether natural or spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:09">[02:05:09]</a>. This includes physical protection, such as being the first to take a bullet if there's a shooting, and being willing to sacrifice for his family, even going without food or sleep [02:06:01]. Spiritually, he garrisons his family in prayer, resisting demonic influences by declaring God's presence [02:07:27]. Men are encouraged to engage in physical training like martial arts to intimidate potential enemies and fulfill this protective role [02:06:34].

## Role of Women

The [[gender_roles_in_biblical_times | role of women]] is outlined in Genesis, where God created woman as a "helper suitable" for man, because man was perfect but incomplete on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:38">[02:07:38]</a>. The government of the home is placed in the man's head, and the woman's role is to help him in his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. She is a cooperator, assisting in raising and disciplining children, and in maintaining the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>.

## Love and Submission in Marriage

The principal duty of the husband is to love his wife, while the main duty of the woman is to obey and honor her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>. This framework suggests that women need love, and men need submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>. Marriage functions with hierarchies, similar to a studio with a boss and leaders, where someone gives orders and others obey for a common purpose [02:09:01]. The husband is the "pilot" leading the home, consulting his wife as the "co-pilot" who assists in making decisions and provides valuable input [02:09:42].

Submission from the wife is understood as a response to a husband who is willing to give his life for her, loves her unconditionally, and makes sacrifices for her happiness [02:10:42]. This love is likened to Christ's love for the church, which was unconditional, sacrificial, and to the point of giving his life [02:11:08]. A husband's love should not be based on his wife's merits or conditions, such as physical appearance or abilities [02:11:31]. It involves making sacrifices for her well-being and treating her as if he would be willing to die for her at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:52">[02:13:52]</a>. Forgiveness is a central component, as a person who has received immense forgiveness from God should be able to forgive others, regardless of the offense's level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:40">[02:52:40]</a>.

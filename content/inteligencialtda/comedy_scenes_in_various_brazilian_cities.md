Brazil boasts a vibrant and evolving [[standup_comedy_in_brazil | stand-up comedy scene]], with various cities developing their unique comedic cultures and venues.

## São Paulo
São Paulo serves as a major hub for [[standup_comedy_in_brazil | stand-up comedy]] in Brazil. Many comedians, including Afonso Padilha, Thiago, and Nando, lived together in São Paulo, fostering a communal environment for comedy development. This arrangement, starting around 2014, also saw other comedians like Renato, Rodrigo Marques, Victor Ahmar, Luca Mendes, and Gui Preto residing in the same building or nearby, contributing to a vibrant collective of artists [00:05:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, [00:05:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>). Bruno Romano also relocated to Vila Leopoldina in São Paulo [00:06:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>).

The city's comedy scene is characterized by numerous shows, with comedians often performing multiple sessions per day, sometimes up to 20 shows a week [00:08:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>). The "Comedians Club" is noted as a key venue in São Paulo, with Bruno Romano living nearby [00:06:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>). The city's scene facilitated continuous work and development for comedians, allowing them to refine their material and adapt to different audiences [00:08:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, [00:08:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>).

## Curitiba
Curitiba holds significant importance as Afonso Padilha's hometown and the place where he began his [[standup_comedy_in_brazil | stand-up comedy]] journey [00:33:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>). He started performing stand-up in 2009 after being inspired by videos of comedians like Rafinha and Danilo, and podcasts [00:41:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>, [00:41:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>). Early shows in Curitiba featured comedians such as João Cotta, Fábio Lins, Léo Lins, Danilo G., Oscar Filho, and Marco Zenni, who created opportunities for new talent [00:42:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, [00:49:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>).

The "Santa Comedia" venue was a crucial spot for open mics and performances in Curitiba, where Afonso had some of his earliest shows [00:53:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>). Even after moving, Afonso maintained strong roots in Curitiba, consistently performing two sessions a month at the Teatro Positivo, which can hold 2,500 people, often featuring other comedians like Aldiclebio [02:54:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>, [02:55:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:07">[02:55:07]</a>).

*   **Porto Alegre**: This city has its own "Porto Alegre Comedy Club" [02:58:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>).

The historical relationship between Edom and Israel is rooted in biblical accounts, beginning with the twin brothers Esau and Jacob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:48">[02:38:48]</a>. This relationship is crucial for understanding later conflicts and eschatological perspectives.

## Origins of Edom and Israel

According to biblical narratives, Esau, the elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, is identified as the father of Edom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:01">[02:41:01]</a>. Jacob, Esau's younger brother, is the progenitor of the Israelites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:37">[02:45:37]</a>. Despite being brothers, a deep-seated animosity developed between their descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:58">[02:42:58]</a>. The Bible records that God "hated Esau" (Edom) while loving Jacob, a prophecy made even before their birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:46">[02:39:46]</a>. This "hatred" is understood as God's opposition to the practices of Esau's descendants, not a pre-birth condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>.

### The Influence of Hittite Culture on Edom
Esau married Hittite women, which caused "bitterness of spirit" to his parents, Isaac and Rebekah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:23">[02:46:23]</a>. The Hittites were known for their religion of "a thousand gods" and allegedly engaged in Luciferian worship, including child sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:57">[02:46:57]</a>. These practices were believed to have been adopted by Esau's descendants, linking the Edomites to a lineage of occult practices and a "contempt for God's law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:05">[02:47:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:54">[02:55:54]</a>.

## Historical Conflicts and Enmity
The historical animosity between Edom and Israel manifested in several conflicts:
*   **Refusal of Passage**: During the Exodus, the Edomites refused to allow Moses and the Israelites passage through their territory, forcing a long detour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:54">[02:44:54]</a>.
*   **Battles with Kings**: Edom engaged in battles with early Israelite kings such as Saul and David, indicating ongoing hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:11">[02:46:11]</a>.
*   **Alliance with Babylon**: A significant demonstration of Edom's hatred for Israel occurred when the Babylonians invaded Judea; the Edomites sided with the Babylonians and helped them capture Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:38">[02:48:38]</a>.

## Transformation and Infiltration

Later in history, the Edomites (also known as Idumeans in the Roman Empire) underwent a forced conversion to Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:19">[02:49:19]</a>. According to historian Flavius Josephus, John Hyrcanus, a Jewish high priest, converted the Idumeans to Judaism around 100-130 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:24">[02:49:24]</a>. This forced conversion is central to a theory that suggests the Edomites then began to infiltrate positions of influence within Israel.

Key figures and groups influenced by this Edomite lineage include:
*   **King Herod**: An Idumean by descent, King Herod ordered the killing of male children under two years old at the time of Jesus's birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:24">[02:50:24]</a>.
*   **Pharisees**: Some interpretations, citing Flavius Josephus, suggest that the Pharisees who opposed Jesus were descendants of these converted Edomites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

This infiltration theory posits that the Edomites, camouflaged as Jews, aimed to gain positions of power and influence within Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>.

## Edom and Conspiracy Theories

This historical trajectory ties into various conspiracy theories, particularly concerning the Illuminati and the New World Order.

### From Sabbatism to the Illuminati
The theory links the Illuminati to historical movements such as Sabbatism and Frankism.
*   **Sabbatism**: Founded by Sabatai Zevi in 1626, this Kabbalist rabbi claimed to be the Messiah and advocated for a reversal of biblical values, where "Lucifer is good, God is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>. His teachings promoted the idea that biblical commandments were no longer mandatory and that "biblical sins were now permitted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.
*   **Frankism**: A century later, Jacob Frank founded an underground sect that publicly followed Jewish law but secretly rejected it, engaging in forbidden sexual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:16">[02:56:16]</a>.

Six years after Frankism's birth, Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:47">[02:56:47]</a>. Adherents of Sabbatism and Frankism then began following the Illuminati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. This theory suggests that the Illuminati believe Sabatai Zevi's soul transmigrated into the dynasty of 13 families who control global systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:11">[02:57:11]</a>.

### The Rothschild Connection
One prominent family mentioned in this context is the Rothschilds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:26">[02:58:26]</a>. Mayer Amschel Rothschild, originally Mayer Amschel Bauer, is credited with creating the modern banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:27">[02:58:27]</a>. His family adopted the name Rothschild ("red shield" in German) from the red, six-pointed shield displayed on his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>. This symbol is linked to Satanism (hexagram) and the color red to Edom (Esau was red, his land was red sandstone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:49">[02:45:49]</a>.

This theory suggests that these purported Edomite descendants control global finance, media, information, and education, thereby shaping world thinking and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:37">[02:59:37]</a>. They are described as being "behind the curtains," orchestrating events, and are seen as a "synagogue of Satan" who claim to be Jews but are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:18">[03:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a>.

## Eschatological Significance
From an [[historical_and_biblical_perspectives | eschatological perspective]], prophecies in books like Obadiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah foretell judgment against Edom in the "end of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:26">[02:51:26]</a>. This ongoing conflict between the descendants of Esau and Jacob is interpreted as a "spiritual war" and a key element leading to the [[the_role_of_israel_and_the_middle_east_in_endtime_scenarios | end-time scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a>. The current [[conflict_in_israel_and_palestine | conflict in Israel and Palestine]] is viewed by some as a contemporary manifestation of this ancient animosity, with extremist groups refusing peace and seeking the "extermination of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

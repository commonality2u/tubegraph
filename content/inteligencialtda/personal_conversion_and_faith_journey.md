This article details the [[personal_anecdotes_and_experiences | personal conversion]] and [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | faith journey]] of Pastor Sara Shiva, as well as her teachings on [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spirituality]], relationships, and the nature of music.

## Early Life and Influences

Born to Brazilian music icons Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes, Sara Shiva grew up in an environment of significant artistic freedom and lacked repression regarding her choices [00:16:41]. Her parents were part of the "Novos Baianos" movement, a musical and community movement that felt oppressed by the political climate of the 1980s [00:14:11]. This upbringing instilled in her a personality with great freedom, leading her to have no resistance to God's "no" later in life, unlike many who project repressive father figures onto God [00:17:41]. She always heard that she would "choose her destiny" and "go after her dream" [00:17:03].

Before her [[conversion_and_spiritual_journey_of_pastor_antnio_jnior | conversion]], Sara Shiva lived a "crazy life" [00:53:23], was a samba school dancer [00:53:43], and described herself as "extremely promiscuous" [00:53:48]. She never drank alcohol or used drugs, stating she "didn't need to" [00:53:30]. At the time, she identified with a mystical, esoteric, and humanist perspective, having been a Kardecist for six years, and did not believe in the existence of the devil [01:05:50].

## The Turning Point: Encounter with Evil

In October 1997, at 24 years old, an incident profoundly challenged her beliefs. While leaving a rehearsal for her mother's band at 3 AM, a person from the team, seemingly possessed, attacked her [01:05:31]. During this attack, Sara Shiva's "spiritual vision opened" for the first time, allowing her to see the person as transparent and a "monster," a demon, behind them [01:06:28]. This experience shattered her previous belief that "the devil does not exist" and that it was merely a "thing of the human mind" [01:07:32].

A Christian friend, Ludi, who had been praying for her for 10 years, confirmed what Sara had seen, stating, "it wasn't the person, it was the enemy" [01:08:28]. This confirmation led Sara to accept Jesus Christ [01:09:43].

## The Conversion Experience

After accepting Jesus, Sara began a deeply personal journey of prayer. Without knowing biblical instruction, she intuitively entered her room, closed the door, and began talking to God [01:09:56]. For about 15 days, she would come home from work, lock herself in her room, and speak to God, saying, "I know you exist and now I know that the devil exists... I want to know the rest of this story" [01:10:45].

One day, while writing a letter to God, she felt a "subtle" and "anesthetizing" presence in the room [01:12:11]. She heard a voice that seemed like her own thoughts but was actually God speaking to her [01:12:28]. This voice answered all her questions, confirming that Jesus was God, that He died and resurrected, and that the Bible was true [01:15:26]. The voice then pronounced her name, "Sara," and she felt it resonate through "all her cells" [01:14:30]. She collapsed to the floor in a "consuming love" [01:15:56] and experienced a profound cry of brokenness, realizing her unworthiness in the face of God's holiness [01:16:05].

> [!NOTE] A profound and transformative encounter.
> "He said like this now I'm going to stop talking to you but I'll stay here but I'll need to stop talking and said this word here Oh because your little heart spoke to him diminutive your little heart is not holding on but I will leave my holy spirit here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>

The experience left her overwhelmed, feeling a pleasure "better than life" [01:18:03], an understanding that "His love is better than life" [01:18:03], which she describes as a "glimpse of a little piece of eternity" [01:18:28].

The morning after this encounter, Sara immediately called her mother to share the news, but her mother thought she was "crazy" and hung up [01:19:27]. Two years later, her mother also had a similar supernatural experience with God within a church setting [01:19:58], leading to the [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | conversion]] of her family.

## Impact on Career and Ministry

After her conversion, Sara initially continued her secular music career as a backing vocalist in her mother's band and with her own band, SNZ [01:05:31]. She maintained her faith while working, viewing it as her profession [01:17:15]. However, two years after her initial conversion, she was baptized with the Holy Spirit, which led to her receiving spiritual gifts like discernment of spirits and visions [01:22:09]. She began to receive songs directly from heaven, not needing to seek inspiration [01:22:40].

A pivotal moment occurred during a show with her sisters where she saw demons dancing with transparent people in the crowd [01:23:51]. This vision prompted her to question her profession, and she felt God telling her, "It was for me your show" [01:25:11]. This led to a profound internal struggle, as her work supported her daughter and home [01:24:51].

Later, while listening to a CD by Cirilo AntÃ´nio Cirilo, she read a phrase: "God did not create music to give pleasure to the human being" [01:26:25]. This triggered a powerful vision where she saw a "gigantic orchestra" in heaven, then the devil falling to earth, claiming, "I will steal your worship, I will steal your Worshippers, I will steal your music, I will steal your Arts" [01:27:38]. The vision continued, showing radios playing secular music and, finally, a large festival where a 20-foot tall demon in a black cape stood behind the band, claiming the worship for himself [01:29:43].

> "every show is a cult in disguise who is there? being worshipped in your cult there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>

This vision made her realize the spiritual implications of secular music [01:29:17]. When her band was later dismissed due to changes in the music industry, she felt immense relief and glorified God for being "freed" from that environment [01:32:07]. She then made a covenant with God to "never sing again a song from the world, to never dance again a world song" [01:33:17].

## Key Teachings

Sara Shiva's [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | teachings]] are often direct and rooted in her personal experiences and biblical interpretations.

### The Theology of Sound
She emphasizes that "all music comes inspired or from heaven to hell, there is no music neutral" [02:48:00]. She believes music is one of Satan's greatest weapons but also one of God's greatest [01:12:12]. Citing Isaiah, she explains that the devil was the "chief of the music of heaven" [02:27:00] before his fall, having a "power to make music" that God did not take away [02:08:00]. This means that even seemingly "neutral" music can carry spiritual influence, potentially releasing "spirit of adultery, spirit of divorce, spirit of family destruction" [02:43:47].

### Humanity's Spiritual State
She teaches that humans were created as "spirit, soul, and body" [01:11:00], initially connected. After Adam and Eve sinned, God "cut the link that connected us to our spirit with our soul" [01:12:00], leaving humanity with a "dead spirit" [01:13:00]. Being "born again" is the spiritual reconnection of the spirit with the soul and body, allowing a person to experience God's presence [01:14:00].

### The Importance of Holiness and Boundaries
Sara believes that holiness is essential for spiritual protection, as "the devil is not afraid of anyone being used, otherwise he would not enter the church" [02:26:48]. He is afraid of "holiness in your private life" [02:26:57]. She identifies five "entry doors" through which desires are awakened: vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste [01:16:00]. To maintain holiness, one must be "radical with what you consume," including films and music [01:51:53].

> [!NOTE] The two pillars of invocation.
> The two main pillars for spiritual invocation on Earth are identified as "sex and arts" [01:33:57]. She argues that sexuality must be consecrated to God within marriage, and the arts must also be for God, not profane [01:34:30]. This is why these areas are often targeted by the devil [01:34:53].

### [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_faith_practice | Challenges in Faith Practice]]
Sara acknowledges that living a life of [[role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_struggles | faith]] and [[the_role_of_faith_and_grace_in_overcoming_personal_challenges | holiness]] is difficult [00:52:49]. She openly shares her own struggles, including being celibate for over 22 years as an unmarried believer [00:54:39]. She highlights the hypocrisy often found in the Christian community, where some condemn external sins like drug use or drinking but overlook internal sins like gluttony [02:00:00]. She also discusses the spiritual attacks she faces, including fake news campaigns and direct demonic encounters, as a result of her ministry [02:22:22].

## Relationships and Marriage

Sara places great emphasis on marriage as a sacred covenant and the most important aspect of Christian life after accepting Jesus [00:40:24]. She states that God uses marriage to teach fidelity [00:40:14].

### Three Steps to Marriage
She outlines three steps for a couple to be married "before God and before the law of Men":
1.  **Legalization before human law:** This involves civil marriage [01:40:16].
2.  **Priestly Blessing:** A priest or pastor who believes in God's word administers a blessing over the couple. This doesn't require an expensive party; it can be done simply [01:40:46].
3.  **Consummation (Honeymoon):** The marriage is consummated through "carnal conjunction" or sexual intercourse [01:41:56].
She criticizes those who skip steps, especially engaging in sexual relations before civil or priestly blessings [01:42:10].

### Dating and Boundaries
Sara advises against kissing during the initial dating phase, especially for those with a past of sexual activity [01:54:07]. She believes that kissing before marriage "instigates a desire that is not time still" [01:53:06]. The dating period, she argues, is for getting to know the person's character, arguing, and seeing their "bad side" [01:53:12]. She proposes a "hand test" on a first date, where if the person takes their hand away politely, their reaction reveals if they are abusive or not [02:08:35]. She stresses the importance of choosing a partner based on friendship and character, not just physical attraction [00:58:56].

> [!INFO] The danger of sexual transfer.
> Sara refers to a "transfer of spirits through sexual intercourse" [02:58:12], stating that "neutral sex" does not exist; it is always an "exchange" [02:58:17]. Therefore, intimate relations outside of a consecrated marriage risk demonic influence [02:58:35].

## Conclusion

Sara Shiva's [[spirituality_and_personal_growth | personal journey]] is marked by a deep commitment to God's will, even when it involves significant personal sacrifice. She encourages others to embrace holiness, understanding that true happiness and fulfillment come from God, not from worldly pleasures or relationships [01:46:01]. Her ministry aims to awaken people to abandon sin and live a life fully consecrated to God [02:57:28].

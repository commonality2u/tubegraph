### Introduction to Occultism and Its Perception
The term "occultism," which means "hidden" (from the Greek root "tayxos" for esoteric), refers to knowledge or practices that are not openly displayed but are reserved for those initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:50">[07:22:50]</a>. This contrasts with exoteric knowledge, which is for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:30">[07:29:30]</a>. Historically, occultism is not inherently dark or evil, but rather encompasses a more esoteric, hidden story of spirituality and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. The perception of [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | occultism]] as dark is largely a later misinterpretation, often fueled by various institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

### Occultism in Pop Culture and its True Meaning
Many figures in pop culture, especially comic book writers like Alan Moore, have been deeply involved with [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | occultism]] and incorporated its concepts into their works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Alan Moore, initiated in a school of [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | occultism]] and a Thelemite, consciously infuses his comics like *V for Vendetta* and *Watchmen* with references to Thelema and [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | occultism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. *V for Vendetta*, for example, elaborates on Chaos Theory, which Moore sees as essential for transformation in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Other artists, including those influenced by the Golden Dawn [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | occultism]] (a prominent 19th-century English order influenced by Aleister Crowley), embed subtle or overt occult references in their music and visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:38">[02:18:38]</a>. The Beatles (e.g., *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>, Led Zeppelin (with Jimmy Page's interest in Crowley and acquisition of Boleskine House) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>, The Rolling Stones, Madonna, Katy Perry, and Jay-Z are cited as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Many of these artists are Thelemites, incorporating symbols and archetypes related to the "New Aeon" or "Age of Aquarius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Historical Separation of Science and Spirituality
Historically, science and spirituality were deeply intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. Figures like Paracelsus, considered a father of modern medicine, was also an alchemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. The symbol of medicine, the caduceus, is rooted in the staff of Hermes Trismegistus and Eastern yoga's Ida and Pingala currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>. Great scientists and politicians like Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, and Thomas Edison were initiates in various esoteric traditions, including Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. They drew inspiration and inventions from kabbalistic and hermetic references, accessing what Plato called the "plane of ideas" or "astral plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

The separation of science and spirituality, and the subsequent labeling of certain practices as "occult," largely began with the rise of the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. Practices that were once open and normal became repressed and hidden, leading to the term "occult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

### The Origin of "Satan" and "Devil" in the Bible
The Catholic Church, originating from the Roman Flavian dynasty (Vespasian family, Flavia Domitila, Constantine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, forged many narratives, incorporating and reinterpreting existing archetypes and [[mythology_and_spirituality | mythology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. For instance, the papal miter is linked to the Philistine god Dagon, a deity of agriculture and fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

In the earliest Hebrew biblical texts, the concept of a single, evil entity named "Satan" or "devil" does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **"Elohim"**: The first name for God in Genesis 1:1, "Elohim," is a plural term, meaning "God of Gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This indicates that ancient Hebrews recognized a supreme energy while also acknowledging other forces of nature as archetypal deities, a paganistic understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **"Satan"**: The word "Satan" first appears in the Bible in Numbers 22:22 and 1 Samuel 29:7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. In original Hebrew, "Satan" (or "lessat√£") means "opponent" or "adversary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
    *   In Numbers, God places an angel in Balaam's path as an "opponent" (Satan) to prevent heresy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
    *   In 1 Samuel, David is referred to as an "adversary" (Satan) by the Philistines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, in these early texts, "Satan" is an adjective or epithet, not an evil entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

The idea of Satan as a singular, evil entity separated from God emerged after the Babylonian exile (586 BCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. During their captivity, Jews had contact with Zoroastrianism, a dualistic doctrine featuring a good God (Ahura Mazda) and an evil God (Ahriman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. When they returned to Israel, this dualistic influence led to the development of Satan as an entity in later biblical books like Zechariah and Job, though still subordinate to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:40:07]</a>. The shift to Satan as an "enemy of God" appears in First Chronicles 21:1, a later book, contrasting with the older Second Samuel 24:1, which describes the same event as the "Wrath of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This indicates a migration of the concept of an arch-enemy into the Jewish narrative, influenced by Babylonian contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Thus, the "devil" or "demon" as a personified evil entity is a later invention or misinterpretation, not present in the earliest biblical texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### The Origin of "Lucifer"
The name "Lucifer" is found only once in the Old Testament, in Isaiah 14:12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This passage refers to the fall of the King of Babylon, comparing him to the "Morning Star, son of Aurora" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This "Morning Star" is Venus, which appears before sunrise and disappears shortly after, leading ancient Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Romans to associate its disappearance from the sky with a fall due to pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

In Greco-Roman [[mythology_and_spirituality | mythology]], "Lucifer" (Latin for "light-bearer") or "Phosphorus" (Greek) was a deity representing the Morning Star, the son of Aurora, associated with beauty and light, not evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Ancient Greek wedding songs, called epithalames, would evoke the forces of Lucifer to bless couples with passion, a custom later Christianized by the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

The confusion arises from Saint Jerome's 4th-century Vulgate translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin, where he translated the "Morning Star" in Isaiah 14:12 as "Lucifer," mistakenly turning an epithet into a proper name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. Luciferians, rooted in Kabbalistic and alchemical traditions, do not associate with the biblical depiction of Lucifer as an evil entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

### The Origin of "Demon"
The word "demon" derives from the Greek "Daimon," referring to good spirits of nature, geniuses, or intelligences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Socrates, for example, spoke of having a "Daemon" inspiring him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. "Caco Daimon" referred to negative spirits, but these were not viewed as absolutely evil; they were forces like depression or war, which, while unpleasant, have an evolutionary factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. For the Greeks, all nature had an intelligence, with spirits existing in fire, water, earth, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

The Catholic Church later demonized figures from Greek culture, taking deities like Pan, the faun, and the satyr, adding horns and tails, and labeling them as "the devil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. They also took the name "Daimon" and turned it into "demon," a term associated with evil, to maintain control over populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

### Solomon and His Connection to Magic and Demons
Solomon, renowned for building the First Temple in Jerusalem, was also deeply associated with [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | magic]] and the control of "daimons" (geniuses or spirits of nature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. According to the Quran (Surah 27, 28, 37) and the Talmud, Solomon possessed incredible abilities, including speaking to animals and transporting objects through magic, giving rise to myths of flying carpets and genies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:30">[02:08:30]</a>.

The First Temple, built around the "stone of creation" on Mount Moriah, was a repository of ancient wisdom, including books of Jewish Babylonian and Kabbalistic magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. These "grimoires" or books of magic, such as the *Goetia* and *Clavicula Salomonis* (pseudo-epigraphic, meaning not necessarily written by Solomon himself), are believed to contain rituals for invoking these daimons for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

The Talmud describes Solomon invoking "models" (demons with wisdom in mathematics and language) and receiving a "Samir" (a magic worm) to cut large stone blocks silently and quickly for the Temple's construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This highlights that in ancient times, invoking spirits was not seen as contrary to belief in God but as a means to achieve tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Templars, Freemasonry, and Occult Discoveries
After the destruction of Solomon's First Temple by the Babylonians and the Second Temple by the Romans, the site remained significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. During the Crusades, the Catholic Church sent pilgrims to Jerusalem, and King Baldwin II, with the Patriarch of Jerusalem, allowed nine Knights (led by Hugo de Payns) to establish their headquarters on the site of Solomon's Temple in 1118 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. These knights later became known as the Knights Templar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Historians do not fully understand why the Church granted the Templars such authority over the site, which was believed to contain vast treasures and ancient texts, including books of high magic and possibly the Ark of the Covenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It is speculated that the Templars discovered profound secrets beneath the Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. After 10 years, they met with Abbot Bernard, a close associate of the Pope, and were suddenly granted immense power and freedom by the Catholic Church, including the ability to lend money and operate the first banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The Templars were later accused of practicing "strange cults" and worshipping entities like Baphomet (an alchemical symbol, not the devil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. In 1307, King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V betrayed and annihilated the Templars, arresting and martyring their last Grand Master, Jacques DeMolay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Before his death, DeMolay allegedly cursed them, and both the King and Pope died tragically within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

A last Templar ship is believed to have sailed from La Rochelle, France, to Scotland, carrying the Grail, the Ark, or other significant knowledge, where it influenced the origins of Freemasonry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. [[magical_and_occult_practices_in_high_magic | Freemasonry]] itself is heavily based on Solomon's Temple and the Torah, and does not involve the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### The Evolution of Religious Thought and the New Aeon
Religious concepts and human understanding of divinity have evolved through different "Aeons" or astrological ages:
1.  **Aeon of Isis (Paleolithic/Matriarchal)**: Divinity was seen as feminine, embodied by Mother Earth and goddesses like Isis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Women were religious leaders, and sacrifices were made to nature for abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Aeon of Osiris (Patriarchal)**: Marked by the settlement of humanity, the concept of private property, and the rise of patriarchal societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Divinity became male, symbolized by the sun's daily "death" and "rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This era emphasized sacrifice and rebirth, with male gods being worshipped, like Osiris and Mithras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This period was characterized by religious conservatism and taboos, including monogamy for hereditary lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Aeon of Horus (Age of Aquarius)**: This current era, starting roughly 100-200 years ago, is characterized by the union of spirituality and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. It promotes individual spiritual inquiry, freedom from traditional models, and the breaking down of taboos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The focus shifts from external authority to finding God within oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### The Bible and Its Interpretation
The Bible, particularly the New Testament, is noted to contain deeply kabbalistic and metaphorical language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Many passages should not be interpreted literally. For example, Jesus walking on water symbolizes his mastery over his emotions, not a physical act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The number 666 is also a kabbalistic number related to Tiphareth (the solar element) and the hexagram (Star of David), symbolizing balance and harmony, not evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

The New Testament, written after the apostles, underwent significant changes through various councils, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. During this council, books were selected or excluded, and narratives were crafted to suit the Roman Empire's desire to control rebellious Jewish populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This led to a "docile Christ" figure, contrasting with the more revolutionary historical Jesus described in apocryphal texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The Role of Imagination, Unconscious, and Ritual in Magic
Magic, particularly Chaos Magic, is understood as the creation of one's own magic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. It involves impregnating things with one's own energy through spiritual appearance and active imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Sigils, symbols created by the magician from their unconscious or subconscious, are a key part of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Carl Jung's work on archetypes populating the unconscious is referenced in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Rituals are a way to organize messages for the unconscious, which operates symbolically rather than logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. By manipulating symbols and energies in a ritual (e.g., circle of salt, candles, chalice), one can reorganize the unconscious and emanate potent energy to transform reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This aligns with the "Law of Attraction" but emphasizes the need for internalizing desires into the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

The Abrahamelin ritual, for example, is described as an acceleration of life's karmic processes, confronting one's inner and outer "demons" or shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Aleister Crowley's attempt at this ritual in Boleskine House is cited as an example of opening powerful forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Conclusion: Reframing "Evil" and Embracing Balance
The speaker emphasizes that "evil" as an absolute entity does not exist in the Bible or in deeper spiritual understandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. There are only negative energies or situations that are part of an evolutionary process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The concept of a "devil" or "Satan" as an arch-enemy is a later construction, often used to control people and explain away personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. True spirituality involves seeking inner balance and understanding the interconnectedness of all things, embracing both light and "darkness" (shadows, challenges) as necessary for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

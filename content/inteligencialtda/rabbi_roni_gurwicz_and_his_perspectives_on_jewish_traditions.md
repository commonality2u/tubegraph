Rabbi Roni Gurwicz, featured in an interview from Jerusalem, discusses various aspects of Jewish tradition, faith, and daily life, sharing insights from his extensive knowledge and the largest Jewish channel globally [00:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">00:00:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>).

## Kashrut and Biblical Precepts
Kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws, requires careful adherence to [[cultural_and_spiritual_perspectives_on_the_jewish_identity | biblical precepts]]. Rabbi Gurwicz explains that this goes beyond obvious prohibitions like pork [00:01:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">00:01:36</a>). Modern food engineering means seemingly innocuous products, like sliced bread with 90 ingredients, might contain non-kosher elements such as lard [00:01:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">00:01:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">00:02:05</a>). In Israel, most products have a Kosher certification, indicated by a "thigh" sign [00:01:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">00:02:17</a>). Hotels in Jewish parts of Israel must have Kosher food, with supervisors present 24/7 [00:02:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">00:02:29</a>). Strict rules include two separate kitchens for meat and milk, meaning a McDonald's in Israel won't serve a cheeseburger [00:02:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">00:02:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">00:02:43</a>).

## The Temples in Jerusalem
Rabbi Gurwicz discusses the history and significance of the Jewish Temples in Jerusalem, which were built on the same sacred site [00:05:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">00:05:41</a>).
*   **First Temple:** Built by King Solomon, son of King David, after David laid the foundations [00:04:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">00:04:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">00:04:40</a>). It was renowned for its immense wealth and gold, reflecting the peak of Israel's empire [00:05:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">00:05:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">00:05:29</a>). This temple was destroyed by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, leading to 70 years of exile [00:08:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">00:08:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">00:08:50</a>).
*   **Second Temple:** Rebuilt after the Babylonian exile under the spiritual leadership of Ezra and later expanded by King Herod, who sought redemption for past sins [00:07:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">00:07:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">00:07:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">00:07:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">00:08:19</a>). This temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE [00:09:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">00:09:00</a>). Unlike the Greeks who aimed to Hellenize, the Romans sought total destruction [00:09:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">00:09:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">00:09:43</a>).
*   **Purpose of the Temple:** The Temple was built as a "Tabernacle" for God to "live inside you together with you," symbolizing God's presence among humanity [00:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">00:06:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">00:06:12</a>). Jerusalem was chosen as the permanent site [00:06:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">00:06:30</a>).
*   **Third Temple:** There is an ancient project and biblical prophecies (Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah) for a Third Temple, envisioned as "a house for all nations" where everyone can approach God [00:10:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">00:10:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">00:10:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">00:10:29</a>). Current efforts focus on rebuilding its utensils in preparation for a divine order [00:10:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">00:10:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">00:10:52</a>).
*   **Controversy:** The proposed site for the Third Temple is currently home to the Dome of the Rock, a sacred place for Muslims due to the tradition of Muhammad's ascent to heaven from there [00:11:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">00:11:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">00:11:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">00:12:10</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">00:13:22</a>). Both the State of Israel and leading rabbis officially oppose touching this site to avoid a major conflict, emphasizing maintaining the status quo unless God provides a clear sign [00:13:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">00:13:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">00:14:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">00:14:25</a>).

## The Ark of the Covenant
The Ark of the Covenant, containing the tablets of the law, is considered the most sacred object in the world, located in the Holy of Holies within the Temple [00:13:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">00:13:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">00:16:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">00:17:01</a>). It is said to have immense spiritual power, with biblical accounts describing plagues in areas where it was stolen [00:17:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">00:17:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">00:17:35</a>). Unlike other Temple artifacts which can be replicated, the Ark cannot [00:16:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">00:16:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">00:16:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">00:16:28</a>). Theories suggest it was hidden in the Temple Mount's underground or taken by the Romans, dismissing rumors of its presence in Ethiopia [00:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">00:15:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">00:16:33</a>). Notably, despite Judaism's stance against idolatry, the Ark features two carved cherubs (angels), representing the loving relationship between God and the people of Israel [00:18:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">00:18:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">00:19:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">00:19:52</a>).

## King Solomon and Demons
King Solomon, known for his extraordinary wisdom, was a central figure who built the First Temple and authored biblical texts like Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and Proverbs [00:23:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">00:23:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">00:23:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">00:23:29</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">00:23:42</a>). Stories from [[oral_traditions_and_their_importance_in_judaism | oral tradition]] and the Talmud (specifically the Gittin tractate about divorces) describe Solomon's encounter with demons [00:32:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">00:32:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">00:32:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">00:32:54</a>). He reportedly imprisoned the "chief of the demons," named Madai, to extract knowledge about a mythical animal called Samir [00:33:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">00:33:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">00:33:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">00:34:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">00:34:11</a>). Samir possessed the unique ability to carve stone without metal, which was crucial for constructing the Temple's sacrificial altar according to biblical law [00:33:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">00:33:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">00:34:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">00:37:30</a>). This interaction was for a sacred objective, not a forbidden act [00:34:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">00:34:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">00:37:17</a>). Rabbi Gurwicz explains that the story where Solomon supposedly committed idolatry is a misunderstanding, as he was actually defeating and pretending to be the demon Madai as part of a spiritual battle to fulfill God's will [00:38:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">00:38:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">00:38:10</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">00:38:28</a>).

## [[Kabbalah and its misconceptions | Kabbalah and its Misconceptions]]
Rabbi Gurwicz clarifies that the word "Kabbalah" (קבלה) means "receiving" in Hebrew [00:39:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">00:39:38</a>). It refers to a body of mystical teachings within Judaism that explains the spiritual dimensions of the Bible and creation, initially transmitted as an [[oral_traditions_and_their_importance_in_judaism | oral tradition]] [00:40:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">00:40:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">00:40:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">00:40:47</a>). It delves into concepts like the soul's parts (Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah) and God's infinite nature as the creator of time and space, being "more than infinite" [00:40:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">00:40:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">00:41:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">00:41:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">00:41:53</a>).

He stresses that true Kabbalah is not magic, black magic, or a self-help course [01:02:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">01:02:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">01:02:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">01:02:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">01:02:44</a>). Misconceptions arise from commercialized interpretations, often found in self-help books or external traditions like hermetic Kabbalah, which are "completely different" from authentic Jewish Kabbalah [00:42:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">00:42:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">00:42:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">00:42:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">00:42:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">00:43:03</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">00:45:37</a>).

## [[Oral traditions and their importance in Judaism | Oral Tradition]]
Rabbi Gurwicz emphasizes that the written Bible (Torah Shebichtav) is incomplete without [[oral_traditions_and_their_importance_in_judaism | oral tradition]] (Torah Sheb'al Peh) [00:28:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">00:28:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">00:31:04</a>). This oral law, given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai with explanations and rules, was passed down through generations of wise men and the people [00:28:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">00:28:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">00:28:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">00:28:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">00:30:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">00:31:12</a>).
*   **Examples:** The Bible mentions circumcision but not *how* to perform it [00:26:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">00:26:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">00:26:41</a>). Similarly, the commandment to wear "fringes" (tzitzit) and keep the Sabbath requires oral explanation for practical application, especially with modern technology [00:26:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">00:26:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">00:27:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">00:29:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">00:30:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">00:30:22</a>). The prohibition against lighting a fire on Sabbath is part of 39 "creative activities" derived from oral tradition, not just "work" as commonly understood [00:31:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">00:31:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">00:32:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">00:32:13</a>).
*   **Compilation:** Fearing loss of knowledge, the oral tradition was eventually written down in works like the Mishnah and Talmud [00:29:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">00:29:10</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">00:29:14</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">00:29:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">00:29:27</a>).

## Biblical Translations and Codes
Rabbi Gurwicz highlights common mistranslations in the Bible, such as "Red Sea" (originally "Sea of Reeds," referring to vegetation) and the fourth plague being "flies" instead of "a mixture of ferocious animals" [00:47:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">00:47:24</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">00:47:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">00:47:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">00:48:04</a>).

He also discusses the phenomenon of biblical codes, where names, dates, and events are hidden within the Hebrew text, particularly the Pentateuch and the Book of Esther [01:11:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">01:11:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">01:12:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">01:12:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">01:12:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">01:15:44</a>). These codes can reveal past and possibly future events, like the assassination of Israel's Prime Minister [01:12:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">01:12:29</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">01:12:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">01:12:47</a>). A notable example is a code in the Book of Esther that seemingly predicted the hanging of 10 Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials in 1946, correlating with Esther's request to hang Haman's ten sons [01:17:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">01:17:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">01:17:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">01:19:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">01:19:15</a>).

## [[Historical and biblical perspectives | Jewish Eschatology]] and the Messiah
From a Jewish perspective, the concept of the Apocalypse as a catastrophic destruction is not accepted [01:21:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">01:21:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">01:22:02</a>). The goal of creation is ultimate kindness and human perfection [01:22:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">01:22:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">01:22:37</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">01:23:09</a>). The Messiah, a human being, will lead humanity to its perfection, teaching people to understand that there is only one God and ending idolatry and death [01:24:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">01:24:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">01:24:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">01:25:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">01:25:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">01:25:39</a>). This vision is one where God's presence will be so strongly revealed that free will, as we know it, will end, because knowing God's presence eliminates the choice to do evil [01:27:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">01:27:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">01:27:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">01:27:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">01:27:44</a>).

## Free Will and Divine Knowledge
A recurring theme is the paradox of free will in the face of God's omniscience. Rabbi Gurwicz explains that God, as the creator of concepts like feelings, time, and space, is not subject to them [01:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">01:00:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">01:00:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">01:00:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">01:00:53</a>). Thus, divine "anger" or "surprise" are metaphors to help humans understand God's interaction within their limited vocabulary [00:58:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">00:58:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">00:58:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">01:01:12</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">01:01:36</a>).

He asserts that humans undeniably have free will, citing biblical passages that link reward to good actions and punishment to evil ones [01:03:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">01:03:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">01:03:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">01:04:45</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">01:04:48</a>). Prophecies, like Abraham's descendants suffering in a foreign land, do not negate free will because they don't specify *who* will cause the suffering, allowing individuals to choose their actions [01:04:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">01:04:10</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">01:04:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">01:04:43</a>). Even Pharaoh initially hardened his own heart before God did so, illustrating how repeated negative choices can condition a person's free will [01:05:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">01:05:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">01:06:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">01:07:49</a>).

## [[Modern societal challenges and religious perspectives | Humanity's Progress and Divine Intervention]]
Rabbi Gurwicz believes that humanity is improving, citing the evolution of societal ethics regarding slavery, racism, and social rights [01:28:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">01:28:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:32">01:28:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">01:28:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">01:29:11</a>). While evil persists, practices once considered normal are now seen as barbaric and are punished [01:29:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">01:29:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">01:29:26</a>).

God still intervenes in the world, though often in subtle, hidden ways, unlike the overt miracles of the Old Testament [01:30:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">01:30:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">01:30:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">01:30:41</a>). He points to Israel's defense against missile attacks, where thousands of missiles fail to cause significant damage, as an example of divine intervention [01:30:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">01:30:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">01:31:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">01:31:12</a>). He quotes a terrorist who, when asked why their missiles failed, attributed it to God being with Israel [01:31:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">01:31:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">01:31:54</a>).

## The Red Heifer
The red heifer (Parah Adumah) is a biblical concept essential for purification in Judaism [01:33:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">01:33:13</a>). It's the only means for a person who has come into contact with a dead body (which is not a sin, but causes ritual impurity) to become pure again [01:33:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">01:33:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">01:33:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:47">01:33:47</a>). The ritual involves sacrificing a completely red cow (without two hairs of any other color) on the Mount of Olives and using its ashes for purification [01:33:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">01:33:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">01:33:56</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:12">01:34:12</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">01:34:18</a>). Only nine such cows have been found throughout history [01:33:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">01:33:58</a>).

## Personal Reflections and Mission
Rabbi Gurwicz views his life as a continuous journey of growth. He describes leaving Brazil and an attractive job offer at 21-22 to pursue a deeper, more meaningful life in Israel as his most challenging, yet ultimately rewarding, decision [01:37:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">01:37:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">01:37:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">01:37:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">01:37:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">01:38:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">01:39:35</a>). He emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's potential and mission with joy, constantly asking himself if he is doing everything he can to help others and "enlighten" them [01:41:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">01:41:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">01:41:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">01:41:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">01:41:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">01:41:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">01:41:46</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:47">01:46:47</a>). His mission is to be "a light to the nations" by explaining Judaism and its teachings, not to convert [01:35:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">01:35:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">01:35:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">01:35:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">01:35:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">01:54:33</a>). He maintains an online channel and the "Moses Academy" to teach biblical Hebrew and provide in-depth, well-founded knowledge [00:47:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">00:47:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">01:19:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">01:38:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:06">01:39:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:43">01:39:43</a>).

He acknowledges the power of words and intention in shaping reality, stating that positive words with positive intent can clarify the heart and expand it, while negative ones can have the opposite effect [01:10:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">01:10:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">01:10:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">01:10:49</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">01:11:14</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">01:11:20</a>).

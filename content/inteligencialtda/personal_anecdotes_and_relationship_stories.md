She also shares [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | personal challenges]] and [[comedy_careers_and_personal_stories | personal stories]] related to her life as a woman and a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Relationship with the "Deceased"

Cris Paiva's previous relationship, which she describes as her "deceased" relationship, lasted nearly seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. She often jokes that she was "the man of the relationship" because she managed their finances and was the primary decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The relationship ended abruptly around New Year's Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### The Breakup Story
Leading up to the breakup, her ex-partner claimed his father was sick as a reason to travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Cris later discovered he was traveling to be with another woman, as evidenced by a photo posted on New Year's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When she called him, he refused to talk, claiming low phone battery, and then messaged her on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He eventually called her back ten minutes later and confirmed he was with someone else, stating he was "very happy" and "not married to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Cris's initial reaction was disbelief, thinking it was a prank or an encrypted message due to him being kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. He later deleted her from social media and was seen publicly with his new partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This sudden end to their relationship, without a clear discussion or fight, caused her to feel betrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. She later learned he had met the new partner the day he traveled for a show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

### Shared Life and Its Dissolution
During their relationship, they combined their lives, swapping out old furniture for new items and managing shared expenses, although Cris initially handled most of the bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. After the breakup, he returned to the house while Cris was away and removed all his belongings, including furniture, appliances, and even pillowcases, leaving the house completely empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. He also took their dogs and refused to let Cris or her daughter see them, advising her daughter to "look for a lawyer" when she asked about the dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>.

## Personal Growth from Adversity

Despite the painful breakup, Cris found the experience to be a "liberator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. She lost 9kg due to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a> and discovered a new sense of emotional freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:11">[03:13:11]</a>. She attributes her ability to quickly recover to her inherent optimism and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:33">[02:13:33]</a>. She considers the experience a "gift" that allowed her to regain control of her time and focus on herself and her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:16">[03:29:16]</a>.

## Comedy and Personal Life

Cris has incorporated her separation into her comedy, creating a stand-up routine about it. It took her time to find the right tone for the jokes so that the audience would laugh *with* her, rather than feel pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:05">[03:25:05]</a>. She states that her "separation text" is one of her most anticipated pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:57">[03:39:57]</a>.

### Impact on Career
Before the breakup, Cris often felt guilty about her professional successes because of her ex-partner's ego. She would try to fit him into her shows or decline invitations to avoid his negative reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:52">[03:17:52]</a>. After the separation, she felt free to pursue her career fully, resulting in more opportunities, including a new radio program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:27">[02:14:27]</a>.

## Motherhood and Early Life

Cris always wanted to be a mother. At 15, she decided she would have a daughter named Mariana when she turned 18, a goal she documented in a letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:36">[03:37:36]</a>. She chose a teaching career primarily because it offered part-time work, allowing her to balance work and motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. While she excelled as a teacher and had good relationships with students, she never felt a true "gift" for the profession, describing it as a means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:56">[03:41:56]</a>. Her parents were also teachers, though her father became a bank auditor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Future Plans

Cris is set to co-host a new podcast with Yasmin Yassine, an extension of the "Flow Podcast" universe, focusing on broader topics beyond traditional "feminine" discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:48">[02:27:48]</a>. The podcast aims to present a different perspective on general subjects, not exclusively for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.

## Personal Preferences and Opinions

Cris openly discusses her preferences and strong opinions on various topics:

*   **Relationships:** She now prefers partners who have their own space and desires a relationship where they see each other "when you feel like it," due to her established routines and habits from living alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. She also prefers men who are "chubby" and have beards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:02">[05:12:02]</a>, and finds men who are "too muscular" or "skinny" unattractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:50">[05:18:50]</a>.
*   **Social Interactions:** She has a low tolerance for people who create drama or attack others online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>. She believes in intellectual honesty and strong arguments over personal attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. She has set her social media (Twitter) to prevent direct replies to avoid unnecessary conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>.
*   **Political Views:** Cris describes herself as a liberal who leans to the right on some issues, like gun control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. She criticizes the polarization of political discourse and the "cult" of political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:54">[02:03:54]</a>. She believes both sides of the political spectrum can exhibit hypocrisy and damaging behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:25">[02:05:25]</a>.
*   **Plastic Surgery:** Cris recently underwent nose surgery and had procedures on her eyelids and a double chin reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:29">[03:00:29]</a>. She chose a specific surgeon, Dr. Laerte, based on his reputation, not price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:27">[03:05:27]</a>. Her nose, originally wide and rounded, was reshaped to appear thinner and longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>. The healing process for her nose is expected to take four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.
*   **Movie Preferences:** She enjoys films that evoke strong emotions, even if they are sad. She cites "How I Was Before You" as a movie that made her "sob" in the cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>.
*   **Misophonia:** Cris experiences misophonia, particularly sensitive to sounds of people chewing gum or animals licking themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>.
*   **Professional Name:** Her professional name "Cris Paiva" with two "S"s comes from her early blogging days when another "Cris" existed. To differentiate herself, she added an extra "S" to her first name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:35">[03:03:35]</a>.

## Introduction to Frei Gilson's Ministry

Frei Gilson Vilera, a Carmelite Friar and priest, shared his [[personal_transformation_and_faith | personal journey of faith]] and insights on [[spirituality_and_personal_beliefs | Catholic doctrine]] on the *Inteligência Limitada* podcast. He described his joy at the invitation to the podcast, which he received through a bishop, viewing it as a "voice of God" and a mission [00:03:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He respected the host, Rogério Vilela, for his respect towards interviewees [00:03:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Personal Journey of Faith

### Early Life and Lack of Religious Influence

Frei Gilson revealed that he did not have a Catholic upbringing [02:00:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>. His parents were separated, with his father's side being more focused on spiritualism and his mother's side being Catholic in name but not practicing [02:00:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. He grew up largely without a strong religious reference [02:01:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:16">[02:01:16]</a>. He lived in Pinheiros and Paraisópolis during his childhood, enjoying street football and typical childhood games [02:01:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>. As a child, his main aspiration was to be a football player [02:02:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>.

### Mother's Conversion and Frei Gilson's Awakening

His [[personal_transformation_and_conversion_experience | spiritual journey]] began around age 9 when his mother converted to Catholicism and started enrolling him in catechism for his first communion [02:02:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. He initially attended catechism and mass out of obligation rather than desire, "pushed by his mom" [02:03:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a>.

His true [[personal_transformation_and_redemption_journey | awakening to faith]] occurred when he was around 11 years old, living in Paraisópolis [02:03:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:20">[02:03:20]</a>. His mother, living her conversion, opened a prayer group. At first, it was just 10 elderly ladies [02:03:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>. His stepfather, whom his mother married after her first marriage was annulled by the Church [02:04:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>, taught him to play the guitar to win him over [02:04:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>. He started playing for the prayer group, which then grew significantly [02:05:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>.

Initially shy, he eventually had to take on singing and speaking roles in the group due to the lead singer's absence [02:05:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>. This responsibility became a turning point for his [[personal_transformation_and_redemption_journey | conversion]]. He realized he "couldn't sing what [he] didn't live" or "preach what [he] didn't live" [02:05:37]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a>. At 13 or 14, he gained an awareness of needing to change his life [02:06:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>. He began participating in Canção Nova, listening to sermons from priests like Father Jonas Abib and Father Leo, which impacted him deeply [02:07:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He realized that the life presented by Jesus was "better than this life that I'm in" [02:07:07]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

Despite a seemingly normal childhood, he felt "empty" because he lacked intimacy with God and knowledge of the Church's teachings [02:07:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>. His mother observed his positive changes, and he attributes his [[personal_transformation_and_redemption_journey | conversion]] greatly to his mother's prayers, citing Saint Monica's prayer for Saint Augustine [02:09:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>.

### Journey to Priesthood and Religious Life

At 18, Frei Gilson entered the convent as an aspirant [02:30:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. He progressed through stages, from postulant (receiving a mini-habit) to novitiate (receiving the full religious habit) [02:30:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>. During his novitiate year, he lived a reclusive life, learning about Christ, the Church, and his Carmelite charism [02:31:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>. After this, he professed temporary vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, which could be renewed for up to 9 years [02:32:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>. Three years ago, he made the decision to take perpetual vows, committing to this life permanently [02:32:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:19">[02:32:19]</a>.

As part of his formation, he studied philosophy for 2 years and theology for 4 years [02:33:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:36">[02:33:36]</a>. He was ordained a priest and has served for 10 years [02:33:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:41">[02:33:41]</a>. His first assignment was at the Parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Grajaú, São Paulo, where he served for 9 years [02:33:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>. His daily duties included celebrating mass, hearing confessions, visiting the sick, giving catechism, and leading retreats [02:34:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:14">[02:34:14]</a>. He highlighted that unlike other professions, a priest is a priest "at all times" [02:35:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:22">[02:35:22]</a>.

He addressed the common doubt regarding commitment, explaining that he dated a girl he had liked since age 11 before committing to religious life [02:36:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>. He made it clear to her that he was discerning a priestly vocation, seeking an honest experience to confirm his path [02:37:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>. After three months, he realized that it "wasn't his way" and that despite feeling full in the relationship, he also felt "empty," which confirmed his calling to be a religious [02:38:05]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>.

## Core Teachings and Beliefs

### The Primacy of the Bible

Frei Gilson emphasized the paramount importance of the Bible, asserting that it is the "main rule" [03:13:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>. He highlighted that God Himself began writing the Bible on stone tablets for Moses [03:18:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>, and its purpose is for humanity to "never forget" God's word [03:28:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:10">[03:28:10]</a>. He stressed that the Bible's words are "not a man's word, this one is a word of God" [03:45:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:47">[03:45:47]</a>.

### God's Plan and Free Will

Addressing the question of God's plan, predestination, and free will, Frei Gilson asserted that God created humanity in His image and likeness [03:42:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:27">[03:42:27]</a>. He cited Jeremiah 1:5, stating that God knew and consecrated individuals "before you were born" [03:44:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:24">[03:44:24]</a>. Ephesians 1:4 further clarifies that God "chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless" [03:46:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:19">[03:46:19]</a>. Thus, the ultimate purpose for everyone is holiness and happiness [03:47:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

He strongly affirmed free will, explaining that God created humans in freedom, otherwise, they would be "robots" [03:51:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>. God knows all things but does not determine choices [03:56:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:21">[03:56:21]</a>. The "tree of knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis symbolizes this freedom; choosing to eat from it meant humanity wanted to determine good and evil for themselves, denying God's authority [03:53:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:38">[03:53:38]</a>.

### Sin, Salvation, and Holiness

Frei Gilson defined sin as a "fault against reason, truth, and right conscience," a "lack of true love for God and for neighbor" [04:11:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:52">[04:11:52]</a>. It is an "affront to God" and the main obstacle to salvation [04:14:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:01">[04:14:01]</a>. He cited Galatians 5:19-21 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, listing practices like fornication, idolatry, drunkenness, and greed, and stating that those who practice them "will not inherit the kingdom of God" [04:17:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. He emphasized that these are warnings, not condemnations, and that through sincere repentance, anyone can be "washed, sanctified, and justified" [04:22:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:52">[04:22:52]</a>.

The only unforgivable sin is "sin against the Holy Spirit," which is the deliberate refusal of God's grace and forgiveness, a definitive closing off to God's will [04:23:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:55">[04:23:55]</a>.

Holiness, the ultimate purpose, means "being another Christ" and imitating Jesus [04:47:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:55">[04:47:55]</a>. It involves renouncing the "old man" (sinful tendencies) and adhering to Christ's virtues [04:49:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:15">[04:49:15]</a>. He guaranteed that "in sin no one is happy"; true, lasting happiness is found only in Christ [04:59:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:04">[04:59:04]</a>.

### Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory

Frei Gilson described hell, citing Matthew 13:41-42, as a "fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth," a place of "total absence of God" and suffering, not a "cool place" as depicted by some [05:12:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:04">[05:12:04]</a>. Heaven, described in Revelation 21:4, is a place where "God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there will be no more death, nor mourning, nor crying, nor pain" [05:14:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:39">[05:14:39]</a>. Purgatory, in Catholic teaching, is a temporary place of purification for those already saved, as "no one can reach God with the least sin" [05:25:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:45">[05:25:45]</a>.

## [[Personal and supernatural experiences related to faith | Personal Practices and Miracles]]

### The 4 AM Rosary

Frei Gilson shared a significant [[personal_anecdotes_and_challenges | personal practice]]: praying the Rosary at 4 AM daily. He initiated this during a Lent, wanting to give God something more costly than just abstaining from sweets [04:40:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:45">[04:40:45]</a>. He chose his sleep as an offering, setting his alarm for 4 AM to pray the Rosary before the Blessed Sacrament for 40 days [04:41:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:03">[04:41:03]</a>.

He decided to livestream these sessions, initially hoping to help those with insomnia [04:42:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:35">[04:42:35]</a>. To his astonishment, thousands of people joined, with numbers growing from 20,000-60,000 in the first week to over 317,000 live viewers on his social media during later Lents [04:43:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:31">[04:43:31]</a>. He later realized this practice mirrors Jesus, who often woke up at dawn to pray [04:44:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:41">[04:44:41]</a>. He describes dawn as a "time of great power," free from distractions [04:44:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:57">[04:44:57]</a>.

### Testimonies of Healing and Divine Intervention

Frei Gilson shared a testimony of a woman who experienced a miraculous healing of her deviated septum while praying the Rosary with him at 4 AM [04:54:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:39">[04:54:39]</a>. This story, among "thousands of testimonies," underscores his belief that "miracles happen when you pray" and are a result of individuals making their part in faith [04:56:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:04">[04:56:04]</a>. He emphasized that God is not "magic"; one must "renounce sin" and "put yourself in prayer" for blessings [04:56:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:35">[04:56:35]</a>.

## Role of the Church and Evangelization

### Hierarchy and Authority

Frei Gilson clarified the hierarchy in the Catholic Church: deacon, priest, and bishop [01:48:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. The Pope is the Bishop of Rome and the successor of Peter [01:53:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:36">[01:53:36]</a>, while bishops are successors of the Apostles [01:53:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:18">[01:53:18]</a>. He explained that religious (like himself) follow a rule of life inspired by a saint and live in community, taking vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, unlike secular priests who manage parishes [01:31:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>.

### Evangelization and Truth

He stated that every Christian is called to be a missionary [01:47:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>, highlighting the Church's global evangelization efforts [01:47:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:59">[01:47:59]</a>. He stressed that the Church's primary role is to defend the "truth," which he identifies as Jesus Christ himself [01:48:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. He illustrated this with the example of defending life in the womb, stating that it is a "scientific, real, factual truth" that there is a child there, regardless of other reasons or ideologies [01:33:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. He warned against calling "evil good and good evil," which he sees as a "portrait of current society" that is morally and spiritually decadent [01:28:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

### Addressing Controversial Topics and Societal Influence

Frei Gilson acknowledged concerns about societal interference within churches and the suppression of certain speech on social media [01:49:17]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. He asserted that "telling the truth for someone became an offense" in today's world [01:50:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>. He emphasized the importance of freedom of expression for evangelization [01:50:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:43">[01:50:43]</a>.

Regarding homosexuality, he cited the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2357), which states that homosexual acts are "intrinsically disorderly" and contrary to natural law because they "close the sexual act to the gift of life" [01:56:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. However, he clarified that the Church calls for homosexual persons to be accepted with "respect, compassion, and delicacy," avoiding "every sign of unfair discrimination" [01:57:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>. The Church condemns the sin but not the sinner, asking individuals with homosexual tendencies to live chastely [01:59:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>. He stressed that this is not his opinion or the Pope's, but the unchanging "truth of the scriptures" [01:57:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Idolatry and Images

Frei Gilson defined idolatry as anything placed "in the place of God" [02:22:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>, including money or social media [02:23:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. He stated that the Catholic Church condemns worshiping images, but uses them as "memories" and reminders of saints' virtues [02:23:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:23:55]</a>. He explained that the Eucharist, where the bread and wine become the "material body of Jesus Christ," is the sole object of worship [02:27:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:12">[02:27:12]</a>.

## Reflections and Doubts

His "worst moment" in life was when he "lived a life away from God" [03:04:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:53">[03:04:53]</a>, viewing subsequent difficulties as opportunities for growth [03:04:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:59">[03:04:59]</a>. His greatest doubt remains how, despite God's immense love and sacrifice, some individuals freely choose to reject Him [03:07:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:54">[03:07:54]</a>.

Addressing the feeling of not hearing God's answer in prayer, he explained that God's answer can be varied: "yes," "no," "wait," or even "silence" [02:47:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:48">[02:47:48]</a>. He assured that God's silence is often a form of communication, a test of faith, or a preparation for hearing something deeper, often found in the "desert" of quietude [02:48:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:31">[02:48:31]</a>.

## Final Message

Frei Gilson concluded by reiterating that every individual is "chosen by God" before the foundation of the world, for a purpose of "holiness" and "happiness" [03:10:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:20">[03:10:20]</a>. He urged listeners not to believe that life ends in this world, emphasizing the reality of an afterlife (heaven or hell) and God's relentless desire for everyone's salvation [03:11:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:35">[03:11:35]</a>. His advice was to "open your heart" to Christ, who is the "way, the truth, and the life" [03:12:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:31">[03:12:31]</a>.

He sang a song summarizing his message: "You are the center of my life, the reason for my joy. I don't want to take my eyes off you. I want you to be the center, Lord, of my life" [03:18:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:06">[03:18:06]</a>. He added that the world with its desires "passes away," but "he who fulfills the will of God remains forever" [03:14:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:36">[03:14:36]</a>.

He reminded listeners that "Jesus has to be the most important" thing in their lives, more than work, family, or personal philosophies, because "he is God" [03:15:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:21">[03:15:21]</a>.

[[Theological Significance of Salvation and Grace | Historical Christianity]] is defined by core beliefs: one triune God, revealed through the Old and New Testaments; Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who died for humanity's sins, rose on the third day, and will return a second time [0:47:00]. This aligns with the Apostles' Creed [0:47:27].

## The Problem of Sin and the Need for Redemption

Humanity is inherently "flawed" [0:01:39]. The account of the fall of man in Genesis Chapter 3 explains why humans are inherently "bad" or born with "original sin" [0:11:35, 0:11:57]. At a certain point, the first humans decided to disobey God, disconnecting themselves from the "Source of All Good" [0:12:46, 0:12:56]. This separation from God is the basic problem of the human race [0:13:00, 0:13:03].

This inherent flaw means that "no individual... is not marked in some way by inconsistency, by failure... to achieve some ideal he has in heart" [0:12:18, 0:12:25]. Humans are born with this flaw and cannot achieve perfection on their own [0:12:31]. Even humanity's "best works" are "stained for reasons selfish" [0:40:49, 0:40:52, 0:40:54], and are "never good enough" to meet God's standard [0:40:18, 0:40:46].

Sin requires a payment; God, being righteous, "cannot forgive for free" [0:32:40, 0:33:03]. Someone must pay for the sin, and the "wages of sin is death" [0:33:06, 0:38:48].

## Jesus Christ: The Path to Forgiveness

The ultimate solution to the problem of sin is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus is both "100% God and 100% man" [1:01:57, 1:01:58], uniquely capable of mediating between God and humanity. He was created "without sin but with the possibility of disobeying" [1:02:25, 1:02:29]. However, he "never committed sin" [0:32:02, 0:32:05, 0:39:40, 0:39:42].

The core of [[Christianity and redemption | Christian redemption]] lies in Christ's death on the cross [0:33:18]. He "was delivered by the determined design of God" [2:04:00] and "took upon ourselves our sins" [2:55:55, 3:19:07]. On the cross, "every burden of sin was laid upon him" [3:12:12, 3:16:00], and "he received the punishment that it was for me" [3:18:00, 3:20:00]. This act is central because "no one else could have taken the sin of millions of people" [0:39:18].

Christ's death is what makes [[Christianity and redemption | Christianity]] distinct from all other religions [0:33:29, 0:33:33]. The founders of other religions "did not die in place of their followers" [0:33:37, 0:33:40]; they provided teachings, but only Christ offered himself as the sacrifice [0:37:25, 0:37:32].

The resurrection of Christ is equally vital [0:42:47, 0:42:50, 0:43:11, 0:43:15]. If Christ had died and not risen, he would have been "any man who had died" [0:42:53, 0:42:55]. His resurrection proves his divine nature and the efficacy of his sacrifice [0:43:21].

## The Process of Salvation and Reconnection

[[Nature of Sin and Salvation | Salvation]] for humans is a "reconnection" to God [0:13:06]. No one is born an atheist; humanity is born with an "awareness that there is someone or something above" [0:14:11, 0:14:14]. This innate sense comes from a "gap within us" [0:13:32], a "longing for the time in Paradise" [0:13:35]. Every religion seeks to present "a system that reconnects the person to God" [0:13:13].

In [[Christianity and redemption | Christianity]], [[Religious and Spiritual Beliefs About the Afterlife and Divine Grace | God's grace]] is the favor extended to humanity [0:46:44, 0:46:46]. Forgiveness and [[Nature of Sin and Salvation | salvation]] are received through [[Personal Transformation and Faith | faith]] in Christ and repentance of sins [2:22:56, 2:23:03, 2:23:06]. This is "an act of God" [1:51:08], where God "declares it fair" [1:51:11]. It's not earned through works, but accepted freely [0:40:01, 0:40:03, 1:50:16, 1:50:19].

Once a person has repented and believed in Jesus, they are justified [2:22:56, 2:23:03]. This personal decision means they "don't need to be afraid of going to hell" [1:20:32], as their "guilt has already been paid" [0:32:37, 0:32:39].

Baptism is an "expression" of this decision and an "initiatory rite in the community of Christians" [2:23:10, 2:23:12, 2:23:16, 2:23:18]. It is not what saves, but a public demonstration of one's [[Personal Transformation and Faith | transformation]] and identification as a Christian [2:23:19, 2:24:19, 2:24:28, 2:24:31].

## The Nature of God and Human Free Will

God is described as "absolutely sovereign" [2:25:56] and "totally another" [2:07:07], possessing qualities beyond human comprehension such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence [2:57:27, 2:57:30]. He is holy, just, good, and true [2:29:31, 2:29:32].

The relationship between God's sovereignty and human free will is an "antinomy" â€“ "two truths for which there is no explanation logical for us" [2:57:39, 2:57:42, 2:57:46]. God knows what will happen, and yet humans make free decisions [2:16:09, 2:21:09, 2:21:17]. For example, Jesus's death was "according to God's plan" (God's sovereignty) [2:40:00, 2:41:00], but also caused by human actions ("you killed him") (human responsibility) [2:40:00, 2:40:04].

God's plan "foresaw the fall" [2:09:09], and even the bad things humans choose are part of His will [2:19:41, 2:19:44]. However, God is "not seen in the Bible as the author of evil" [2:22:20]. Evil is attributed to angels or humans [2:26:26, 2:26:28]. God sometimes allows "bad things to happen" or "calamities" not because he delights in it, but to "wake me up" and "get my attention" [3:38:00, 3:38:00, 3:39:00, 3:42:00, 3:44:00].

God's plan culminates in a "New Paradise where sin is no longer possible" [2:21:16, 2:22:19]. This future state will differ from the original Paradise because "the problem of sin was resolved" [2:03:00, 2:04:00].# Christianity: Forgiveness and Salvation

Donald Trump's actions and potential future role are discussed in the context of geopolitical events and biblical prophecies, particularly concerning the Middle East.

## Trump's Presidency and Influence
During his presidency, Donald Trump made significant decisions impacting the Middle East. He was the American President at the time when he transferred the American Embassy to Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This act, according to the speaker, had a "very big outcome in the spiritual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Trump himself stated that he was "inspired by biblical prophecies" to make this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. He received a menorah from Israel, which had "prince of peace" engraved on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

## Critiques of Biden's Middle East Policy
The speaker critiques the actions of the Biden administration, noting that after Trump left the scene, Biden "strategically" entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Biden released 6 billion dollars to Iran in exchange for prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Trump claimed that this money was used to finance [[Islamic extremism and Middle Eastern conflicts | extremist groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a> and specifically for the offensive on October 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.

## Trump's Prophetic Role
The speaker views Trump as a significant figure in end-times prophecies.
He is identified as the "white horse" and the "first Horseman of the Apocalypse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>, who will bring a "false peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. This "false peace" will be achieved through diplomacy rather than military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

There is a strong belief that Trump "will return" to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. Israel reportedly favors him and sees him as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Trump himself has asserted that he is the only one who can prevent a Third World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. He has also stated that if Israel is in danger, he would demand early American elections to "put order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.

Some compare Trump to King Cyrus, a non-Jewish Messiah figure, with a coin even minted in his honor alongside King Cyrus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. This perspective highlights a perceived messianic role for Trump in [[geopolitics_and_religion_relationship | geopolitical and religious contexts]] by certain groups.

## The Global Elite and World Order
The discussion touches on the concept of a "New World Order" and the "Global Elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. These groups, including the Bilderberg Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, are seen as orchestrating global events and conflicts, suggesting that nothing is truly random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. They plan and execute agendas, sometimes even using films to "prepare the staff to react as they want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the current state of [[Global political tensions | global political tensions]] and accelerating events, including wars and rumors of wars, are signs aligning with biblical prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. The rapid pace of events, both technologically and [[global_political_and_economic_dynamics | geopolitically]], is noted as an acceleration of divine timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

The idea of a "great reset" by the World Economic Forum is mentioned as a plan to control agricultural production, aiming for people to stop eating beef, among other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. The intention is to remove paper money and introduce digital currency, like Drex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This control extends to a future where a "universal minimum wage" would require a "score" or a "mark" to be received, ensuring compliance with the "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

## Conclusion on the End Times
The speaker concludes that the current period is the "beginning of the Sorrows" rather than the tribulation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. The full tribulation is expected to begin with a peace agreement, which Trump is anticipated to bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. Events like the eclipse and the reactivation of the particle accelerator are seen as part of a larger, deliberate unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>, with the intention to open portals and release "territorial spirits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. The elite is seen as preparing bunkers to shelter themselves during the coming chaos, believing they will "clear the land" afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:56">[01:58:56]</a>.

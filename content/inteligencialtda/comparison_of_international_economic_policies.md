This article explores contrasting views on international economic policies, drawing from a debate between Elias Jabbour and Renata Barreto. The discussion delves into the role of the state, different economic systems like capitalism and socialism, trade policies, and the impact of state intervention on national economies and global relations.

## The Role of the State in Economic Development

A central point of contention is the role of the state in economic systems.

### State as Creator and Regulator

Elias Jabbour argues that capitalism itself is a "state creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, citing historical examples such as the Puritan Revolution, Industrial Revolution, and the formation of the Bank of England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. He asserts that "the main countries in the world, the main instrument... of induction, nobody... technology government commitment" exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Jabbour states that the more a country scales in technology and reaches the "frontier of knowledge," the greater the presence of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. He highlights that all highly industrialized capitalisms use government purchases to foster their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>. Furthermore, he views the modern military-industrial complex and vaccine development as state-driven, not purely market phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a>.

Renata Barreto counters that capitalism was born out of "necessity" and the "natural evolution of commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>, tracing commercial relations back to the Stone Age with bartering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. She clarifies that liberalism acknowledges a "crucial role" for the state at specific points like education, safety, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. However, she advocates for the state to be "as small as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>, arguing that excessive state interference, regulations, and high taxation hinder entrepreneurship and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### State Capitalism vs. Free Market Capitalism

Renata Barreto characterizes Brazil as having "state capitalism," where private initiative is "heavily regulated by the Brazilian state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. She also applies this term to [[China]], describing it as a "state capitalism" or "private initiative heavily regulated by the State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. She contends that a "free market capitalism" where there is no state interference has "never happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. She emphasizes that countries with greater [[economic_systems_and_state_intervention | economic freedom]] tend to have higher prosperity, citing examples like Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Estonia, and Canada, all of which she considers to have "tiny states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>.

Elias Jabbour views the notion of "free market competition" as not reflecting the "historical dominant way" of capitalism today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. He stresses that the current global economic landscape is characterized by "capital blocks" where large states protect their own capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

## Trade Policies and Protectionism

The discussion highlights different approaches to trade and the concept of protectionism.

### Protectionism and National Industry

Renata Barreto mentions that politicians like Ciro Gomes advocate for a "protectionist" head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>, similar to the "mercantilism" thinking of the English in the 15th-16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>, who believed the economy was a "zero-sum game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. She contrasts this with smaller countries in Eastern Europe that had to create favorable business environments for foreign companies due to lacking resources for protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.

Elias Jabbour refers to a report on manufacturing that "openly preaches protectionism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a> and argues that historically, successful industrial countries (Germany, South Korea, US) have used strong state protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. He challenges the idea of a country achieving "economic complexity without a large state protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

## Economic Systems and Ideologies

The debate touches upon the definitions and practical applications of different economic ideologies.

### Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism

Renata Barreto asks Elias Jabbour how he reconciles his Marxist view with what happens in [[China]], arguing that [[China]] is "state capitalism" rather than communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. She states that "communism was never applied" in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a>, noting that Marx never fully explained the transition to communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>. She criticizes the subjectivity in defining socialism, stating that economic systems should be "simple things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>. She claims that the prosperity brought by capitalism led to "revisionism" within socialist thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.

Elias Jabbour responds that for Marx, the transition from capitalism to socialism would be a "long transition" with "coexistence between them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. He defines socialism as "something that the real movement will show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>, dependent on the "history of the tropical country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>. He rejects "idealized notions of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:44">[03:44:44]</a>. Jabbour also differentiates between Nazism/Fascism and socialism, emphasizing philosophical differences, particularly the rejection of classical German philosophy by the Nazis, while it was taught in Soviet schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Specific Country and Regional Analyses

The debate features detailed comparisons and analyses of several countries.

### China's Economic Model

Elias Jabbour views [[China]]'s model as a "mixed" one, with a strong state presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a>. He highlights [[China]]'s high investment rate (45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>, its role as a "great industrial country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>, and its massive infrastructure development like high-speed rail (40,000 km in 20-40 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. He claims [[China]] invests more in green technologies than Europe and the US combined and plants more trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. He argues that the Chinese Communist Party fulfills "historical tasks that the bourgeoisie" has not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:02">[02:47:02]</a>.

Renata Barreto describes [[China]]'s system as [[economic_systems_and_state_intervention | state capitalism]], arguing that the state's total planning makes it "less efficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. She points to the real estate sector in [[China]] with empty houses as a potential "gigantic bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. She criticizes [[China]]'s human rights record, mentioning ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a> and the "one-child policy" which led to an aging society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:36">[03:36:36]</a>. She also notes [[China]]'s non-participation in agreements like the Paris Agreement, allowing it to pollute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.

### United States Economic Policies

Renata Barreto states that the US constitution was "created to stop the government in relation to the citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a> and that the US is prosperous because it was "free" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:56">[03:56:56]</a>. However, she notes that the US has "fallen considerably in terms of economic freedom" due to increased state interference, particularly after the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. She asserts that the banking crisis of 2008 in the US was a "product of years and years and years of intervention" by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:24">[02:58:24]</a>.

Elias Jabbour contests the US's "moral rule," citing 17 military interventions between 1945-1990 and 47 between 1991-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. He argues that the US is an "aggressive imperialist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>. He refers to the "military industrial complex" in the US as state-led innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a>.

### Brazilian Economic Policies

Renata Barreto characterizes [[brazils_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Brazil's economic strategies and challenges]] as "state capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>, marked by excessive bureaucracy, difficult labor legislation, and high tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. She argues that this hinders small businesses and promotes oligopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. She states that [[brazilian_government_policies_related_to_economics_and_infrastructure | Brazilian government policies related to economics and infrastructure]] lead to high public spending compared to GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.

Elias Jabbour claims the Brazilian state is "much less swollen than any American commander, the German one" when comparing public spending to GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:19">[04:19:19]</a>. He argues that [[brazils_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Brazil]] is undergoing an "absurd deindustrialization" process, with the share of wages in GDP drastically falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:05">[04:05:05]</a>. He highlights the role of state-owned companies like Embrapa in [[brazilian_government_policies_related_to_economics_and_infrastructure | Brazilian agribusiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>.

## Inflation and Monetary Policy

The topic of inflation and its causes is also discussed.

### Causes of Inflation

Renata Barreto posits that "most of the inflation is sold are monetary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>, quoting Roberto Campos that money, like any merchandise, loses value if there is "too much merchandise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47">[03:47:47]</a>. She notes that 43% of US dollars in circulation were issued in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:22">[05:22:22]</a>. She attributes current inflation to "supply shocks caused by the State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:33">[05:33:33]</a>, citing lockdowns and energy crises driven by state policies that closed nuclear plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:50">[05:50:50]</a>.

Elias Jabbour disputes a direct relationship between money issuance and inflation in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, citing authors like Milton Friedman who show a direct relationship only in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. He argues that current inflation is due to the "breakdown of global value chain with the pandemic and with the war in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>, not merely money printing. He mentions that "American orthodox authors" agree that currency may not be neutral in the short term, implying state intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. This directly relates to [[the_potential_impact_of_economic_theories_on_inflation]].

## Global Dynamics and Power Structures

The conversation extends to broader global power dynamics.

### Global Elite and Influence

Renata Barreto states that countries with higher [[Public Policy and Economic Growth Strategies | economic freedom]] have "tiny states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. She describes a current trend where nations with less economic freedom are closer to dictatorial regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>.

Elias Jabbour talks about "capital blocks" competing for market share globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, implying a structured and often state-backed competition rather than a purely free market. He suggests that the US's "global military dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a> influences global relations. This relates to the broader discussion of the [[global_elite_and_its_influence]].

### Political Ideologies and Critiques

Renata Barreto discusses [[discussion_on_political_ideologies_and_critiques | political ideologies and critiques]], such as those of Ciro Gomes and the "protectionist" head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. She draws parallels between certain socialist and authoritarian regimes, suggesting common "illiberal" tendencies and state-centric approaches to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:29">[02:49:29]</a>. She critiques the notion of "socialism of the rich" in Brazil, referring to the "Socialism of the rich" or "Bondholder Socialism" where privileges are sustained for those close to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>.

Elias Jabbour offers a Marxist perspective, describing economic development as a "leap from one point of imbalance to another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. He views socialism as a "historical response to problems historically placed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:44">[03:44:44]</a>, rather than a fixed ideology. He argues that "every Liberal when he gets scared, fascist view" because they prioritize property rights above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>.

## Specific Cases and Policies

### Tarcsio de Freitas' Policies and Political Perspectives

While [[tarcsio_de_freitass_policies_and_political_perspectives | Tarcsio de Freitas' policies and political perspectives]] are not explicitly detailed, the broader discussion about [[brazilian_government_policies_related_to_economics_and_infrastructure | Brazilian government policies related to economics and infrastructure]] and the size of the state in Brazil (which could be seen as aligned with his views) is present.

### Bolsonaro's Government Evaluation

There is no direct [[bolsonaros_government_evaluation | Bolsonaro's government evaluation]] mentioned in this transcript, but the discussion on Brazilian economic policies, particularly regarding state intervention and economic freedom, would implicitly relate to any assessment of his administration.

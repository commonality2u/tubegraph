Frank, a former member of the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), shares his [[experiences_with_crime_and_law_enforcement | experiences with organized crime]], his personal journey, and his current mission to dissuade young people from entering a life of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. He operates a YouTube channel to report on criminal activities and expose the realities of organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.

## Frank's Background and Entry into Crime

Born in São Paulo, in the south zone of Jabara, and raised in Taiaém, Frank grew up in a financially difficult environment despite having hardworking parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. His father, a former taxi driver who became a bus driver after a violent robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, and his mother, a homemaker, instilled honest values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Frank attributes his entry into crime to a "lack of shame" and wanting an easy way out, rather than a lack of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He observed drug dealers making money effortlessly, which influenced his decision to take a "shortcut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

He began his involvement in crime at 15, engaging in robberies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. His initial arrest led him to FEBEM (a juvenile detention center), where he spent a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Surprisingly, he credits FEBEM with helping him discover the Bible and Jesus Christ, a contact he lacked at home due to his parents' differing religious views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. He describes FEBEM as a "piece of cake with sugar," providing five to six meals a day, 10 hours of sleep, and good treatment, refuting claims of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. However, he notes that this environment didn't deter most minors from re-offending; he himself returned to drug trafficking two months after his release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. His mother even urged the judge to keep him incarcerated due to his continued criminal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Frank joined the PCC in 2016 and remained a member until 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. His personal financial earnings from his involvement in organized crime, specifically as an intermediary in drug trafficking, ranged from R$40,000 to R$60,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Leaving the PCC and its Consequences

Frank decided to leave the PCC because he wanted to work honestly and spend more time with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Leaving the PCC is described as "impossible" by Frank, citing several ways, the primary one being "exclusion," which might allow one to leave alive depending on the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Once baptized, members are obligated to follow the PCC's commands, even if it means traveling to another state to kill rival gang members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Frank's own exclusion and being "decreed" (marked for death) stemmed from him speaking out about a mandatory drug purchase maneuver implemented by the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. He revealed that the PCC replaced the monthly membership fee with a mandatory purchase of 1 kg of cocaine for R$12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This revelation led to his decree, meaning any criminal in São Paulo could take his life without needing a "crime court" ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Since then, Frank has been on the run for nearly nine months, constantly moving from city to city and country to country within South America (Uruguay, Chile, Argentina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He rarely stays in one house for more than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. He receives daily threats, including videos of people being tortured and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Frank believes he is still alive due to divine intervention and his constant vigilance, using IP camouflage and VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. His YouTube earnings are often blocked, and he faces financial instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

His mother, aware of his involvement with the PCC, took out a protective order against him, severing contact to protect herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## PCC Structure and "Justice" System

Frank describes the PCC as highly structured, akin to a political party, with a clear hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Final Tuning (High Command)**: Figures like Marcola, Julinho Carambola, Barbará, Jackal, Forged, Tiriça, Andinho, and Abel make ultimate decisions, including alliances with other factions or political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. These are often incarcerated leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Street Tune**: Members like Onion, Forged Onion, and André do Rap operate on the street, following orders from those inside prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Summary (Resumo)**: Brothers who receive "yes or no" from the tune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Support of the Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **General of Inter**: Divided by regional DDDs (e.g., São Paulo, Campinas, Baixada Santista) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **General of the City** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Discipline**: The lowest position, responsible for drug dens (mouths of smoke) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This is the rank Frank held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The PCC maintains strict internal rules, codified in a "statute" (43 items and 17 primer points) that members must read and adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Key rules include:
*   PCC comes before family (e.g., if a family member errs, the PCC member must "charge" them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   Prohibition of "talaricagem" (stealing another member's wife) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, "rati" (stealing within the community or from drug dens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, "snitching" (reporting crime, which led to Frank's decree) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, and "opportunism" (waiting for a moment to exploit another's mistake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   No running from police; fight is always against the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   Support for the PCC in every way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

The PCC operates a "crime court" or "board" to judge infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The "discipline" members act as judges, while others investigate. The "tune" gives the final approval for punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Punishments can range from beatings (only from the neck down, sometimes with wood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> to losing one's life. If the accused is found innocent after death, those responsible for the "bad driving" (misconduct of the trial) may face consequences, including death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Frank witnessed instances of extreme cruelty, including:
*   A man whose joints were broken for cheating on his wife with a transvestite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   Forced "suicides" in prison using "Gatorade" (cocaine mixed with water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   People forced to dig their own graves before being killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Torture and mutilation (cutting fingers, ears, nose) for rival faction members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## PCC's Influence and Social Impact

The PCC portrays itself as a benefactor to communities, providing basic food baskets, organizing parties, and donating medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This masks their oppressive control, where they dictate everything from behavior in favelas to prohibiting "rearing up" (motorcycle stunts) not out of concern for safety, but to avoid police attention that would disrupt drug sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:22:00]</a>. They exploit the state's absence in these areas, acting as de facto authorities in resolving disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

Frank vehemently criticizes the romanticization of crime in media, especially shows like "Sintonia," which he says falsely depict criminals as victims or heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He states that such portrayals are entirely fictitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Political and Financial Infiltration

Frank claims the PCC has infiltrated various sectors of Brazilian society, including:
*   **Politics**: Influencing elections (e.g., urging members to vote for Lula and against Bolsonaro in the recent presidential election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, and having connections with politicians at mayoral and councilor levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Public Transport**: Bus companies in São Paulo are linked to the PCC, forcing owners to sell their businesses to the gang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Involvement in health schemes and hospitals in Baixada Santista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Cleaning Companies**: Contracts with city halls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: A dedicated "real estate sector" responsible for buying and selling faction properties, including "Minha Casa Minha Vida" homes sold by residents fleeing crime-ridden areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Legal System**: The "tie sector" is responsible for hiring lawyers and facilitating the release of arrested members, often through bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Frank states he was released from jail after 23 days for armed robbery by paying R$25 bail, emphasizing the corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Entertainment**: Sponsoring artists and influencers for money laundering and promoting criminal messages through music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Organized Fan Groups**: The PCC controls fights in stadiums, as seen with the Mancha Verde and Gaviões da Fiel factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Frank asserts that Brazil is "in the hands of organized crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Comparison with Comando Vermelho (CV)

Frank highlights key differences between the PCC and Comando Vermelho:
*   **Ideology/Approach**: PCC seeks political influence and alliances, aiming for a more structured, almost "political party" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. CV is more focused on direct warfare and guerrilla tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Recruitment**: PCC does not baptize minors, only accepting members 18 or older in São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. However, in Northeastern states, PCC baptizes from 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. CV baptizes individuals as young as 11 or 12 if they can "squeeze a trigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Support for Members**: PCC offers a "name" and benefits like credit for drugs or borrowed cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. CV invests financially in its soldiers, providing weapons and drugs to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Family Rule**: PCC does not target family members for a member's mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. CV will "take out the whole family" if a member makes a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Drug Use**: PCC prohibits its members from using crack, excluding or even killing those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, viewing crack users as unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Yet, PCC controls "Cracolândia" (Crackland), a moving drug den that is registered and managed by the PCC's FM sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Warfare**: While the PCC was founded on the motto "peace, justice, and freedom," Frank states they live in constant war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The PCC and CV became rivals after a dispute over the death of "Rafat" at the border, who was seen as the "King of the border" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This conflict has led to increased violence, particularly among minors in other Brazilian states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Frank's Message and Motivation

Frank believes that to combat organized crime, society must ridicule criminals and stop romanticizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He advocates for "leather and work" (hard punishment and forced labor) for prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, ending privileged treatment like intimate visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, and making prison a place of suffering, not privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. He emphasizes the need for state intervention in favelas, facilitating police access, and building proper housing instead of shacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Despite the constant threats and lack of official support, Frank continues to speak out. He sees himself as a "dead man walking" in the eyes of criminals, but he does so to "redeem his soul" and open the eyes of young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He has compiled evidence (spreadsheets, videos of politicians, lawyers, and influencers, and crime court proceedings) on a pendrive, hoping to find a trustworthy person to release it if he dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

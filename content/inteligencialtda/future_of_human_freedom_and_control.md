The world is moving towards a new form of dispute: control over the mind and heart of people, rather than territorial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This shift involves technologies like DNA manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, chips, and electronic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Yuval Noah Harari's Perspective
Yuval Noah Harari, an Israeli historian and author of "Sapiens" and "Homo Deus," presents a vision of the future human being as "improved" through the introduction of chips and electronic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. These enhancements would enable humans to compete with [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

Harari argues that 20th-century worldviews, primarily the communist and capitalist (liberal) visions, are now outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He challenges the concept of [[Concept of Free Will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, asserting that human beings never truly possessed it, or will not in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. According to Harari, human actions are results of electrochemical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, and individuals committing violent acts are not inherently "bad" but rather experience disorders or pathologies in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that if devices could be introduced to control such impulses, society would benefit from greater control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## [[Technological Advancements and Global Control | Technological Control]]

The era of control is already upon us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Social Networks and Streaming** We are increasingly controlled by social networks and streaming services like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. These platforms create "bubbles" for users by suggesting content based on past preferences, limiting exposure to contradictory ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This contrasts with past media consumption where one could simply change the channel if they disliked content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:08]</a>.
*   **Data Collection and AI** Our lives are mapped out through data from logins, device usage, video preferences, and location tracking via apps like Waze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. [[Artificial intelligence and its impact on society | Artificial intelligence]] analyzes this data to suggest purchases or content, demonstrating a gradual loss of [[Concept of Free Will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Devices** The concern is the future introduction of devices *inside* the human body, providing an excuse for more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. While such devices offer benefits like treating depression with electromagnetic sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>, the danger lies in who controls them and their potential to influence choices and read thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Philosophical and Spiritual Views on Control and Freedom

### Nietzsche and the Death of God
Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of "God is dead" implies that Western society "killed" God, leading to a breakdown of moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>. Without a moral God above all, there is no one to stop individuals from doing as they please, potentially leading to destructive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>. Nietzsche's "Ubermensch" (Superman) is depicted as a being without moral or ethical restrictions, driven by envy, which he considered the "best feeling" for empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>. This philosophy is linked to figures like Hitler, who, influenced by Nietzsche, acted without fault or ethics to achieve his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>.

### Theological Perspective on Spiritual Warfare and Free Will
From a biblical perspective, [[Concept of Free Will | free will]] exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Intrusive thoughts, depression, and anxiety can have spiritual origins, mirroring in the physiological world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:02]</a>.
*   **Demonic Influence:** Demons can influence thoughts and actions by exploiting "gaps" opened in a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to possess individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.# Future of Human Freedom and Control

### Theological Perspective on Spiritual Warfare and Free Will
From a biblical perspective, [[Concept of Free Will | free will]] exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Intrusive thoughts, depression, and anxiety can have spiritual origins, mirroring in the physiological world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:02]</a>.
*   **Demonic Influence:** Demons can influence thoughts and actions by exploiting "gaps" opened in a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to possess individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Hierarchy:** The Bible describes a hierarchy of evil spirits: principalities (responsible for nations), powers (acting in specific areas like sexuality or violence), dominators (acting over time, bringing trends), and the general rabble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:55">[02:08:55]</a>. Angels, such as Archangel Michael, fight against these forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance:** Resistance against these influences comes through worshiping God, glorifying Him, and rebuking evil, aligning with the biblical teaching that "our fight is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers of the celestial regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:21">[02:37:21]</a>. Spiritual coldness and doubt are generated by evil spirits of the New Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:26">[02:38:26]</a>.
*   **Apostasy:** The Bible predicts "apostasy," a divorce from the truth and a break with Jesus, happening before the coming of the man of lawlessness (Antichrist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>. This involves churches reinterpreting or discarding biblical truths, leading to a message of "Jesus is love, everything is fine, sin does not exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of technology and modern society on human behavior | Impact on Society and Politics]]

The belief in absolute truth is declining in the postmodern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Now, society is evolving to a point where individuals may lose the right to their own bodies, with authorities determining control for societal safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This vision is linked to the "mark of the beast" and the system of the Antichrist, which is seen as preparing now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

### Global Agendas
Organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN 2030 Agenda are pushing for global transformations, including environmental modifications, clean energy, and combating prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:33">[02:41:33]</a>. Nationalist leaders like Donald Trump and Bolsonaro are seen as resistant to this globalist vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:15">[02:51:15]</a>. Many believe the UN 2030 agenda could be led by the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:30">[02:53:30]</a>.

### Brazil's Political Climate
The recent election results in Brazil have caused sadness and fear of civil war, as the nation is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The church is called to be peacemakers and demonstrate love, rather than engaging in partisan hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. Despite political outcomes, God remains sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## [[Technological Advancements and Global Control | Technological Advancements]] and Future Implications

Humanity is in the "fourth revolution," characterized by biotechnology and [[Artificial intelligence and its impact on society | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This revolution will interfere with people's lives and biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.
*   **Epigenetics:** This field suggests that thoughts and emotions can influence genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. For example, deep depression can change one's genes, and these changes can be passed down from parent to child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Telomeres and Immortality:** Scientists are researching telomeres, structures at the tip of chromosomes that control cell multiplication and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. The discovery of telomerase, a substance that prevents cell aging, could lead to an "elixir of eternal life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
*   **Eugenics:** Concerns exist about a future of eugenics, where genetic modifications lead to a "superior race," potentially excluding those without financial means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. The film "Gattaca" is cited as a criticism of this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **AI and Human Augmentation:** Elon Musk's Neuralink is developing chips for the human brain to enhance human capacity to compete with machines, as he believes humans will otherwise become insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Consciousness and Cloning:** [[Modern technology and the apocalypse | Modern technology]] is exploring how to copy a person's entire brain and memories onto disks to achieve eternal life through clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. The film "The Matrix" is presented as a propaganda instrument showing a virtual world as a criticism of Christian society's "castrative" status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.

## The Church's Role and Hope

The future holds continued challenges, including the global rise of the Spirit of Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. While the church is on Earth, it will resist this spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. However, this resistance is not through force but through love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>, just as the early church conquered the Roman Empire through the power of the Spirit and testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:35">[02:42:35]</a>. The church's mission is to preach the love of Christ, especially in times of division and hopelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:11">[02:50:11]</a>.

Despite societal challenges and anxieties, faith means trusting in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. God never forces anyone to act, respecting [[Concept of Free Will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:13">[02:46:13]</a>. The personal decision to surrender one's life to Christ brings transformation, peace, and love, regardless of past sins or external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:08">[02:47:08]</a>. The message is one of hope and the power of Jesus to break chains of fear, hatred, and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:24">[02:54:24]</a>.

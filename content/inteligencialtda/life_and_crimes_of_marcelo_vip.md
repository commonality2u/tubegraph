Marcelo, famously known as Marcelo VIP, is an individual whose life has been marked by a series of audacious deceptions and adventures, leading him through high society events, the criminal underworld, and prolonged periods of incarceration. His story gained significant public attention through documentaries and films detailing his elaborate scams.

## Early Life and Aspirations

Marcelo was born in Maringá, Paraná, and grew up in Curitiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. From a young age, his dream was to become a pilot, a goal he achieved by making friends at an aeroclub situated in front of where he lived, and taking instruction flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. His mother worked at the Ministry of Aeronautics at an air base, which provided him with access to the aviation world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. His father was a Federal Public Servant of the INSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

Marcelo's life of "adventures" began around age 16 or 17, following the early death of his father when he was 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. He started traveling across Brazil, running away from home without a specific destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Early Deceptions

Marcelo's initial scams leveraged the lack of technology at the time.
*   **Free Bus Travel**: He would claim to be the nephew of a bus company owner, allowing him to travel for free and stay in company accommodations across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
*   **Motorcycle Sales Fraud**: While in the army, he sold motorcycles he didn't own through an internal auction, collecting payment upfront and then fleeing to Porto Seguro before anyone could pick them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **Impersonating Musicians**: He once impersonated the drummer of "Nenhum de Nós" to gain entry to a beach party in Santa Catarina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. Another time, in Balneário Camboriú, he pretended to be the guitarist from Engenheiros do Hawaii to secure free accommodation at a hotel and proceeded to "sell" a penthouse to three different people without owning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

## Cartel Pilot and Contraband Flights

Marcelo's involvement as a pilot for a cartel began around 2000 or 2001 in Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Already a fugitive from the army, he met people in bars and became involved in flying contraband across the border into Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. He quickly became "indispensable" by diversifying runways and flight schedules, eventually leading operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

He performed dangerous "Kamikaze flights" to Colombia, which involved flying for many hours over the jungle with just enough fuel to reach remote, unmarked runways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. These flights relied on coordination with a person known as "Uncle Iridium" who would use a satellite phone to inform him of a short window when U.S. radar planes were refueling, allowing him to cross the border undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. Landing was guided by oil barrels lit on the side of makeshift runways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. Marcelo admitted to losing friends on such flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. He reportedly operated as a pilot for 5-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.

## The "Son of Gol" Incident [[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations]]

One of Marcelo's most famous scams involved impersonating the son of Henrique Constantino, the owner of Gol Airlines, at the Recifolia party in Recife around 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. The party featured an exclusive VIP area for guests, making it difficult to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>.

He called the production team, claiming to be "Juliano," an advisor to the CEO of Gol, Henrique Constantino, and requested VIP access for him and two security guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. The hotel staff, eager to accommodate the "CEO's son," provided security and entry to the VIP area. Once inside, he saw Amaury Júnior, a famous celebrity interviewer at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>. Marcelo approached him, and Amaury's producer, upon hearing he was the "president of Gol," arranged an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.

The scam escalated when businessmen at the party offered him their helicopter and private jet, believing him to be the CEO's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. He used these perks to transport himself and celebrities like Amaury Júnior and Marinara Costa's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:00">[39:11:00]</a>.

The deception came to an end at an airport in Rio de Janeiro, where federal police, alerted by his public appearances, recognized him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. Marcelo attempted to dispose of his fake IDs in the bathroom but was caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>. Marcos Frota, a celebrity present at the scene, initially defended Marcelo, but the police confirmed his true identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>.

## Arrests and Escapes [[escape_and_prison_stories_of_marcelo]]

Marcelo served 11 years and nine months in prison, during which he escaped nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. His first arrest was in Balneário Camboriú for ideological falsehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.

### Prison Life and Escapes
Marcelo utilized his observation skills to identify weaknesses in prison routines, enabling him to plan escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>. He gained respect among prisoners due to his "fame" and connections with "main heads of the story" through his past flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>. He noted that in prison, there are unwritten rules of respect and actions that are not accepted, such as harming those who owe alimony or rapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>. His ability to instigate rebellions and escapes made him "highly dangerous" in the eyes of the system, which fears these two actions the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[46:22:00]</a>. One notable escape involved approximately 800 people from Bangu prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>.

### The "Million Bangu" Rebellion
Marcelo was chosen as the spokesperson for a rebellion in Bangu prison, representing two factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. The press, however, attributed leadership of a specific faction to him, which he denies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

## Other Notable Deceptions

*   **Escaping Hotel Arrest**: Once, while hiding in a hotel in Curitiba, Marcelo learned the police were looking for him. He happened to have a Brazilian national football team uniform he had bought for cheering. Upon seeing a local football team (Cascavel) in the hotel's entertainment area, he approached them, claiming to be a "technical observer" for the national team and requested to travel with them, successfully leaving the hotel unnoticed by the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:34:00">[48:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mariana Caltabiano Book Deal**: When Mariana Caltabiano approached him to write a book and make a documentary, Marcelo leveraged a fictional better offer from another producer to negotiate a higher percentage for himself, essentially "scamming" his own biographer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>.
*   **Impersonating a Federal Delegate**: To free a friend arrested for buying marijuana, Marcelo used an old card from the Ministry of Aeronautics (due to his mother's work) to impersonate an "operational delegate for the summer operation." He confronted the local delegate, demanded his friend's release, and also freed the person who had snitched on his friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

## Current Life and Transformation [[rehabilitation_and_current_pursuits_of_marcelo]]

Marcelo's perspective on life changed significantly after he had children. He states he "learned to be afraid" after his first child, Enzo (22 years old), and his daughter, Vitória (22 years old), who has a 6-year-old son, Davi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:28:00">[54:28:00]</a>. This shift led him to decide to "pay his sentence" and live a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

He is currently married to Ellen, who supported him throughout his five years of incarceration, despite him having deceived her about his true identity and profession when they first met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Their relationship began in Cuiabá, and she found out about his arrest through the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

Today, Marcelo uses his intelligence for lawful purposes. He works with lectures and consulting, particularly in combating fraud for banks, applying his past knowledge to prevent scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. He also has a channel, "Marcelo VIPS official," where he shares tips on how to avoid falling victim to scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a>. He acknowledges that while technology has made things easier for him in the past, it has also made it easier for scammers today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:18:00">[55:18:00]</a>.

Marcelo openly discusses his past with his children, ensuring they are aware of what happened and the consequences of choosing the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. His advice to avoid scams is simple: "When the alms are too much, you are my woman," meaning if something seems too good to be true, it probably is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

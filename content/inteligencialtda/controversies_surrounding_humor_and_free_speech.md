Brazilian comedian Danilo Gentili has been involved in some of the "most persecuted cases" in Brazil, with individuals attempting to impede his career trajectory through various "processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He attributes much of this to his comedic style and the reactions it provokes.

## Political Satire and Persecution
Gentili's experiences highlight the contentious nature of [[political_satire_and_its_repercussions | political satire]] in Brazil. He notes that making fun of certain political figures can lead to "retaliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Early Career and Political Scrutiny
During his time as a reporter for CQC (Custe o Que Custar), Gentili recounted being the only member with a temporary contract, constantly fearing his termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. His "inexperienced reporter" persona often led to awkward, yet humorous, interactions, which he leveraged into a comedic "gag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:02">[04:12:02]</a>.

He recalled being expelled from the House of Councilors in São Paulo during his first attempt at being an "inexperienced reporter" while with Agnaldo Timóteo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:02">[04:56:02]</a>. He was also kicked out of Congress for asking a question about a "cash register two" scheme to Arlindo Quinália, then leader of the Workers' Party (PT) in the Chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:02">[05:37:02]</a>. Gentili noted that this incident, occurring around 2008, showed how the PT was "spoiled by the press" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. He felt politicians were placed "on a pedestal that you don't… You can ask anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Humor and Censorship
A significant turning point occurred around 2010 when Gentili was prohibited from making political jokes during an election period, prompting him to move his satire to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>. He performed a "politically incorrect" stand-up show at the National Theater in Brasilia, which was streamed live by UOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>. This show, which included "heavy jokes" about Lula and Dilma, as well as other politicians, led to him being targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. He believes the media began to "decontextualize" his humor, accusing him of sexism and trying to find "the time he slips for us to catch him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.

Gentili observed a shift where humor started to be interpreted as "offense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:28">[01:49:28]</a>. The question of "what is the limit of humor" emerged around this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>, leading to a "gradual division" that persists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. He feels there's an attempt to "censor the comedians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, turning comedy into "militancy" rather than just a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>.

## Impact of Political Correctness and Cancel Culture
Gentili’s experiences connect directly to the broader [[impact_of_political_correctness_and_cancel_culture_on_comedy | impact of political correctness and cancel culture on comedy]]. He highlighted Wilson Simonal as "the first cancelled in Brazil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, noting this occurred "for real" before the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Gentili sees parallels between Simonal's experience and his own, stating that the same tactics used against Simonal were employed against him "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### The "Milk Donor" Case
One of the most notable [[controversies_and_issues_around_dark_humor | controversies and issues around dark humor]] involved a joke about a woman aiming to enter the Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest milk donor. Gentili explained that the joke, written by a screenwriter, was based on a public news story from a "bizarre world" website and used "comic distortion" and "exaggeration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. The joke simply stated that the woman lost her place because "Kid Bengala has already entered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, referring to another public figure.

However, weeks later, news outlets, primarily influenced by the PT press office, published headlines claiming, "Danilo Gentili calls for milk donor...cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. Gentili asserts he never used the word "cow" in the joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:54">[02:15:54]</a>. The woman subsequently claimed her "milk dried up" and that people on the street were calling her a "cow" because of Gentili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>. Gentili views this as a "narrative" created to portray him as a "white male...oppressor who saw a northeastern woman poor man feeding children and said cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. Despite presenting evidence to the court that he did not use the term, he lost the lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>. He believes this demonstrates how a "lie over and over until it turns true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:35">[02:21:35]</a>.

### Legal Challenges and "Fake News"
Gentili has faced numerous lawsuits and accusations throughout his career. He recounts being criminally indicted by Manuela d'Ávila for a tweet from 2018, which he describes as a "loophole" used to pursue legal action against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">[02:03:02]</a>. He also states that political figures like Maria do Rosário "sue with my money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>, using public funds to pursue legal cases against him, while simultaneously being able to call him "sexist" and a "Nazi" on their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>.

In another instance, he lost a sponsorship because activists and progressive bloggers, linked to Dilma Rousseff, circulated a ten-year-old tweet about Big Brother, misrepresenting it as an endorsement of a contemporary rape case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:54">[02:04:54]</a>. They "erased the date" of his post to create a false narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. He calls this a "fake news machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a>, where "hate cabinet[s]" operate to spread misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:28">[02:07:28]</a>. He notes a "two measures" approach, where "bolsomínions" (Bolsonaro supporters) attack on Twitter, while "Progressive attacks in the newsroom of newspaper" with bigger "megaphones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.

Gentili sees a "blacklist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a> of journalists and comedians, where those who criticize the government are targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>. He believes many in comedy who were previously "quiet" now "attack this one and everything world applauding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:18">[02:23:18]</a>, demonstrating a shift in allegiance based on political convenience. Despite these challenges, Gentili maintains that comedians should have the "freedom to make fun of the president" and continue joking regardless of the political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

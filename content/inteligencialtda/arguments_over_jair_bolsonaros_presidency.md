The debate between Marcelo Brigadier and Paulo Kogos frequently touched upon [[political debate on Brazilian politics | political]] stances and the presidency of [[political journey and presidency of Brazil | Jair Bolsonaro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The discussion stemmed from a Twitter exchange where Brigadier criticized those who cast null votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Bolsonaro's Character and Allegations

### Claims of Honesty vs. Corruption
Paulo Kogos asserted that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Jair Bolsonaro]] is "honest and innocent," dismissing accusations against him as "frivolous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He argued that if [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] were not honest, more severe actions would have been taken against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Kogos also stated that police reports are not sufficient proof for accusations; only the judiciary can provide conviction, which he claims doesn't exist for [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] or his children regarding *rachadinha* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Marcelo Brigadier countered that these arguments about lack of conviction were similar to those used by PT supporters for Lula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. He pointed to indications of *rachadinha* (embezzlement scheme) involving Fabricio Queiroz, who was sought by police and found in a lawyer's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Brigadier considered Queiroz a criminal who operated a scheme of public money diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. He highlighted the "lack of sense of proportion" in comparing a minor crime (hypothetically implied for Bolsonaro) with a proven serious crime (Lula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Brigadier also noted that the Public Ministry and Federal Police found several indications of *rachadinha* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

> "Bolsonaro is honest and innocent, and I don't need Lula, give his credentials here because you, you won't disagree with me either. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[0:12:15]</a>" – Paulo Kogos

> "You're comparing, it's neither a minor crime nor a serious crime, you're comparing the hypothesis of a minor crime with a serious crime proven. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[0:12:25]</a>" – Marcelo Brigadier

### "Myth" Status and Public Image
Kogos used the term "Myth" for [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]], explaining it was "funny" and referred to his culturally mythological phrases in a society contaminated by political correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. He cited Bolsonaro's remark about Pedrinhas Prison as an example of a mythological statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. However, Brigadier noted that such statements lose value if [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] "hides a bandit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## Policies and Political Actions

### Economic Freedom and Armament
Kogos argued that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] "did a lot for freedom," citing economic freedom packages and pro-armament stances as examples of his [[Policies and controversies during Bolsonaros term | policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. He conceded that Bolsonaro was "very to the right" of him but still positioned him as a "center right" against the "antichrist of the far left" (Lula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Brigadier countered that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro's]] actions on armament were "fucking crazy" and insufficient, being easily overturned by decrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. He stated that the promises made by politicians, including [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]], are "never fulfilled" once they gain power, ruling only for self-benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

### Abortion and "Unborn Children"
Kogos emphasized the importance of defending "unborn children," stating he would vote for anyone who does not advocate for child abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:53">[03:31:53]</a>. He said [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] would "never pass a skin" in favor of abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:08">[03:32:08]</a>. Kogos also mentioned that the National Secretary for Family under the Bolsonaro government, Angela Gandra, tried to articulate a PEC (Proposed Constitutional Amendment) to change abortion legislation, but it lacked support in the Chamber of Deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:04">[03:36:04]</a>.

Brigadier accused [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] of only using the abortion agenda as "political currency" without genuine interest in protecting the unborn child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:11">[03:32:11]</a>. He highlighted that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] sanctioned a law that would force people to vaccinate, even compulsorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

### Judiciary and "Health Dictatorship"
Kogos claimed that during [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro's]] term, the judiciary was already in charge, making him rule "from exile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>. He cited an instance where the STF (Supreme Federal Court) did not allow [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] to name a superintendent of the Federal Police, calling it "proof that there is activism judiciary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:26">[02:15:26]</a>. Kogos attributed the "health dictatorship" of the pandemic to the government and its supporters, stating that they labeled essential workers as "not essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:15">[02:32:15]</a>.

Brigadier argued that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro's]] actions, including appointing "bad guys" to the Supreme Federal Court, led to Lula's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>. He also stated that Bolsonaro "did nothing" against the "health dictatorship" and that his administration even "sanctioned this law" regarding compulsory vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

## Alliances and Political Maneuvering

### Alliances with the PT and "Centrão"
Brigadier accused [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] of allied with the PT to combat him and that Bolsonaro "did everything for PT to return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. He explicitly stated that [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] allied with the "worst there is of politics, that is the centrão" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>.

Kogos denied allying with the PT, stating his opposition to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. He maintained his criticism of all politicians he views as corrupt, including [[political_journey_and_presidency_of_Brazil | Bolsonaro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.

### Electoral Fund and Funding
Kogos defended taking money from the electoral fund, viewing it as "trolling" the system and using the "enemy's sword against the enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>. He argued that the electoral fund is "immoral" because it takes money from workers to "perpetuate" those already in office and hinders new blood from entering politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. He stated that if people who want to end the fund don't take it, it becomes a "monopoly of the people who are in favor of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

Brigadier condemned the use of the electoral fund, describing it as a "criminal scheme" involving ghost employees and public money diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. He accused Kogos of "being highly Machiavellian" by using a device he considers immoral to gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

## Influence and Responsibility

### Null Votes and Omission
Brigadier vehemently criticized Kogos for encouraging null votes, labeling it an "inconsequence" that "made the PT return to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. He likened it to abandoning a ship's captain when pirates attack, emphasizing a "moral obligation" to choose the "lesser evil" in an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. He argued that public suffering due to government policies is "above your opinions" or personal principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

Kogos defended his stance of not voting for "bums," believing that true change comes from "individual development" and not from politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. He insisted that voting null was "the greatest representation" of dissatisfaction with political options and the "most ancap" (anarcho-capitalist) way to express it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

### Responsibility of Influencers
Brigadier highlighted Kogos's significant influence and responsibility, noting that he is "no longer Paulo Kogos that people keep taking s," but a figure with a "legion of young people who look up to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He urged Kogos to abandon his "hateful position" towards those who disagree, stating it "disserves" the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:8:50">[01:8:50]</a>.

Kogos acknowledged his awareness of this responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. He asserted that his public actions, including taking electoral funds and being "purposefully aggressive" on Twitter, are meant to expose the "shitty" nature of the current system and encourage people to focus on personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The debate concluded with both parties reaffirming their positions, highlighting the deep divisions within the Brazilian right-wing spectrum. Brigadier expressed a desire for a new political composition that fights against authoritarianism and defends core values, while Kogos maintained that Bolsonaro's actions led to the return of the PT, invalidating any perceived positive aspects of his presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>. He maintained that [[Bolsonaros government evaluation | Bolsonaro's]] poor performance and perceived betrayals were the main reasons for the current political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>.

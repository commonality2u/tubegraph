## The Cosmological Crisis (Hubble Tension)

A significant problem in [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | cosmology]] involves measuring the expansion rate of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>. Edwin Hubble, known for the telescope bearing his name, discovered that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and the further a galaxy is, the faster it recedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. This led to "Hubble's Law," which allows for the calculation of the Hubble parameter (h0), representing the universe's expansion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

### Conflicting Measurements
*   **Near Universe Measurement**: When h0 is measured using nearby galaxies (even if far away, considered "close" in cosmic terms), it yields a value of 74 km per second per megaparsec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:47">[02:22:47]</a>. A megaparsec is approximately three million light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Cosmic Background Radiation Measurement**: If the universe's expansion is measured using [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | cosmic background radiation]], which is radiation emitted during the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang]] and permeates the entire universe, the value obtained is significantly lower, around 63 km per second per megaparsec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a>.

This discrepancy, where two different methods yield different expansion rates, is known as the "cosmological crisis" or "Hubble tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:15">[02:24:15]</a>. This suggests that current understandings or models of the universe might be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:54">[02:24:54]</a>.

## The Cosmic Void Theory

One recent theory proposed to explain the Hubble tension is the "cosmic void theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This theory challenges the assumption that the universe is perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, meaning the distribution of matter and galaxies is the same no matter which direction you look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:08">[02:25:08]</a>.

### Our Location in the Universe
The cosmic void theory suggests that our own location in the universe might be within a "cosmic void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:39">[02:25:39]</a>. This implies we are in a region of relatively lower matter concentration compared to other parts of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:48">[02:25:48]</a>.

This non-homogeneous distribution of matter could impact the measurement of the Hubble constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>. If our measurements are taken from within such a "hole," they might yield different values compared to measurements assuming a uniform distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. Correcting for our position within this void could potentially reconcile the conflicting Hubble constant values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:11">[02:26:11]</a>.

Evidence for being in a void comes from measuring our distance to certain galaxy clusters, which, when mapped, indicate we are in a region with fewer of these structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>. While the universe is homogeneous on a very large scale, localized voids can still affect measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:20">[02:27:20]</a>. This theory is an active area of research and discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>.

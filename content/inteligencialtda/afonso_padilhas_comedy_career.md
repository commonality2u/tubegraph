He views comedy as an essential part of his life and continually works to evolve his craft and support new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Padilha's childhood interests included drawing, watching movies and cartoons, and listening to pagode music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. He began working at a young age, starting in telemarketing and at a stationery store between 14 and 15 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:18">[02:26:18]</a>. He also worked as a mechanic trainee, sold phone cards and chips, and briefly worked at Banco Real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:57">[03:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:57">[03:09:57]</a>.

At around 18 or 19, he took a cooking course at SENAC, developing a love for cooking as a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Despite enjoying cooking, he found working in a professional kitchen to be "pauleira" (very hard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:57">[03:33:57]</a>. He never enjoyed formal work, feeling it was "bad to have to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:33">[03:34:33]</a>.

His discovery of writing came from an early age, though he didn't realize its significance until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:50">[03:21:50]</a>. He wrote chronicles and observed daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:20">[03:24:20]</a>. A turning point was discovering Luis Fernando Verissimo's writings, which opened his mind and inspired his own style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:04">[04:40:04]</a>. He started a blog called "Henrique Padilha no Padilha" in late 2008 or 2009, where he wrote regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:37">[03:36:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>.

The comedian Márcio introduced Padilha to stand-up comedy videos by Rafinha and Danilo Gentili around 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Márcio also introduced him to podcasts, leading them to create their own subject-based podcast in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:35">[04:41:35]</a>.

## Early Stand-up Career

Padilha's initial exposure to live [[standup_comedy_in_Brazil | standup comedy]] was at the Risorama festival in 2009, purely as an audience member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:58">[04:00:58]</a>. He met comedian Jefferson, who provided opportunities for new acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. His first stand-up performances were at Bartec and Batman's, where he presented material from his blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

His first shows were around 6-7 minutes long and successful, making him feel like a "genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. However, his fourth performance, an attempt at a 10-minute set at Santa Comédia, was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This experience, though initially disheartening, fueled his dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. He realized that comedy required hard work and consistency, not just natural talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Comedian Apartment

A significant part of Padilha's early career involved living in a shared apartment with other comedians, including Thiago Ventura, Nando Viana, and later Renato Albani and Gui Preto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This arrangement lasted for six years, starting in 2014, and fostered strong bonds and mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Despite never fighting, they decided to move out in 2020 as their individual [[comedy_careers_and_personal_stories | careers and personal stories]] evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This living situation helped them share ideas, stay updated on the scene, and observe new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## Major Milestones and Projects

### Porta dos Fundos
In 2014, Padilha received an invitation to write for Porta dos Fundos, a renowned Brazilian comedy group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. He had previously sent script ideas to Fábio Porchat via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This opportunity required him to move to Rio de Janeiro and work in a structured "writers' room" setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. While the experience offered valuable learning about production quality and letting go of attachment to his writing, the fixed hours and lack of personal freedom made it "very bad" and "uncomfortable" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He decided not to continue after three months, prioritizing his stand-up career and independent writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

### Os 4 Amigos (The Four Friends)
Padilha's involvement with the "Os 4 Amigos" (The Four Friends) group was a turning point for his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:24">[01:52:24]</a>. He joined in 2018, initially living with Thiago Ventura who had started the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. The group gained significant popularity through YouTube videos, with their "joke queue" format going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>. This platform boosted his solo career, leading more people to seek out his individual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.

### Stand-up Specials
Padilha has released multiple stand-up specials:
*   **"Não Tá Compensando Ser Adulto"** (It's Not Worth Being an Adult): Released in 2017, this special gained popularity on YouTube, reaching over 14 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.
*   **"The Soul of the Poor"**: His Netflix special, recorded in a 360-degree venue in Minas Gerais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.
*   **"Essencial"**: Released in 2021 on his YouTube channel, this 53-minute show reflects on essential workers and the cultural importance of art during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.

### Books
During the quarantine, Padilha wrote a book of 40 chronicles in 40 days, titled "Não Vale a Pena Ficar Isolado" (It's Not Worth Staying Isolated), which he sold as an e-book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. He also wrote a children's book, "Papai, Cadê o Vovô?" (Daddy, Where's Grandpa?), inspired by his own relationship with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:27">[02:08:27]</a>.

## Philosophy and Approach to Comedy

Padilha emphasizes a strong work ethic in comedy, comparing it to an athlete's rigorous training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. He writes jokes every day, even if they aren't for stand-up, and constantly tests new material in various venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. He believes that consistency in putting out content, especially on platforms like YouTube, is crucial for building an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

He actively works to strengthen the comedy scene by opening his shows for new comedians, providing them with a platform to perform for larger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. This approach aims to foster new talent and make [[standup_comedy_in_Brazil | stand-up comedy]] a more integrated cultural practice in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:48">[02:50:48]</a>.

Padilha observes the evolution of comedy styles, from observational humor to storytelling, and is now venturing into "opinion" or controversial subjects with his new show "Limited Intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. He sees comedy as his "life" and an extension of who he is, distinct from traditional "work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. He embraces the "addiction" of comedy, constantly seeking the "new drug" of a successful joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:58">[02:52:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:58">[02:52:58]</a>.

## Personal Life and Career Integration

Padilha was raised by a single mother, which instilled in him a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to help his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He attributes his ability to make jokes about personal topics, like his relationship with his absent father, to his mother's pragmatic approach to difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. This openness allows him to find humor in everyday life and personal experiences, which he considers crucial for his comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:56">[02:08:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a>.

He feels immense "gratitude" for his comedy career, as it has allowed him to achieve personal happiness and financial stability, enabling him to support his mother and live comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

## Future Aspirations

Padilha aims to further strengthen [[standup_comedy_in_Brazil | stand-up comedy in Brazil]], aspiring for it to become a deeply rooted cultural phenomenon rather than just a passing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:48">[02:50:48]</a>. He envisions a future where comedy scenes are strong in various Brazilian cities, with local comedians having ample performance and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>.

He also has international aspirations, particularly wanting to perform and establish a presence in Portugal for about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:54">[02:48:54]</a>. Beyond stand-up, he plans to create more series and expand his work within his comedic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>.

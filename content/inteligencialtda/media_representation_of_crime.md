The portrayal of crime and criminals in media significantly shapes public perception, often presenting a distorted reality compared to the lived experiences within affected communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Glorification and Misconceptions
Media, including television series, movies, and music (such as funk and rap), are often criticized for glamorizing or romanticizing crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>. This can lead to a belief that a "right" or "just" path exists within criminal organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.

### Fictional Portrayals vs. Reality
The Netflix series "Sintonia" is cited as an example of a misleading portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. The series depicts a protagonist from a community helping family and friends by getting involved in crime, eventually joining the PCC to protect his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>.
However, this narrative is considered false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. In reality:
*   Individuals cannot simply "ask" to join the PCC; they must receive an invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.
*   The "punishments" or "charges" depicted are not accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.
*   Members typically do not grow within the faction as depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.
*   Speaking to the police is strictly forbidden and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

[!WARNING|Impact on Public Perception]
Such media can create a "totally distorted view" of crime and the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:19">[03:10:19]</a>. They often present criminals as victims of society and police as corrupt or cowardly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. This false image benefits criminal organizations like the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

### Music and Artists
Funk and rap artists frequently produce songs that apologize for or glorify crime, which directly influences young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. For instance, Mc Kauan's songs openly refer to his faction (PCC) and illegal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. The ability of such artists, who may have criminal backgrounds, to appear on mainstream television programs as "artists" is considered "bizarre" and contributes to the normalization and even idolization of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:58">[03:09:58]</a>.

## Self-Portrayal by Criminal Organizations
The PCC actively engages in public relations to maintain a favorable image, especially within communities. They often provide basic necessities, organize community parties, and donate medicine, promoting a false image that they are "good" and in favor of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>. They frame themselves as a "revolution" fighting "the system," when in reality, they implement a worse system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01">[02:55:01]</a>.

This propaganda contrasts with the reality that they oppress workers and extract money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. They claim to enforce justice but create a system where "who has more money can more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:57">[03:00:57]</a>. The PCC's slogan, "peace, justice, and freedom," is a marketing tool as none of these ideals are truly upheld within the faction or the areas they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:36">[01:46:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Misrepresentation
The skewed portrayal of crime:
*   **Discourages Reporting**: Individuals, particularly those in affected communities, are less likely to report crimes to the police, opting instead to bring complaints to former members or those they trust within the criminal sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>.
*   **Hinders Justice**: Public officials and justice institutions often fail to address true criminal activities effectively because their focus is misguided, or they are influenced by public opinion shaped by inaccurate media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>.
*   **Normalizes Criminality**: When crime is romanticized, it desensitizes the public to its true horrors and may even encourage young people to join criminal organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>.
*   **Undermines Police**: The portrayal of police as ineffective or corrupt discourages proper investment and public support for law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:06">[03:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

[!NOTE|Impact on Public Perception of Crimes]
The speaker, a former PCC member, emphasizes the importance of sharing the reality of crime to counter misleading narratives, as many do not understand the true nature of organized crime and the oppression it brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Media and Justice
Frank, a former PCC member, recounts his challenges in reporting actual criminals and the lack of support he receives from authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. He has been labeled a "farce" by legal figures despite providing evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. This highlights the disconnect between the legal system and the on-the-ground reality of crime. He argues that officials prioritize "big fish" cases (those affecting taxes or luxury goods) over local oppression in favelas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. His experience contrasts sharply with the witness protection programs often depicted in American media, which are virtually non-existent or inaccessible for lower-level informants in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.

Marcelo, a figure known for his past adventures, now dedicates his efforts to combating fraud, leveraging his unique experiences to provide insights into modern security challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. His current work involves lecturing and consulting, particularly for banks, on how to prevent fraudulent activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

## Technology: A Double-Edged Sword
While [[impact_of_technology|technology]] has brought significant advancements, it has also inadvertently simplified the process for scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. Marcelo emphasizes that it is now "much easier, much easier, much easier" to become a victim of scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. His current focus is on staying "a step ahead" to protect his clients on various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

### How Technology Facilitates Fraud
Modern [[impact_of_technology|technology]] enables fraudsters to execute complex scams with relative ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. Scammers can hack into personal data, gaining access to sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. For instance, they can use an individual's data to navigate platforms, access personal panels, and obtain information from sites like Serasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. This allows them to:
*   Change addresses and phone numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   Apply for credit cards in the victim's name and CPF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   Utilize high credit scores to acquire cards, which are then used by the perpetrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

Although mechanisms exist to prove non-involvement in such fraudulent activities, the process can still lead to financial harm for individuals and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.

### High-Profile Examples
A notable example cited is the individual who hacked into Neymar's bank account, successfully transferring 200,000 reais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. The hacker justified his actions by stating the bank's system was "faulty" and that Neymar's account was deactivated through this flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. He claimed the bank was at fault for the vulnerability, not him, and had already used the money to improve his mother's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

## Strategies for Prevention
Marcelo now shares [[technology_and_its_impact_on_societal_behavior_and_faith|tips on how not to fall for scams]] through his official social media channels, "Marcelo VIPS official," newly created for the relaunch of his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

A timeless piece of advice for avoiding scams:
> "When the alms are too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a> or "When something is free, it doesn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

This implies caution when offers seem too good to be true. He recounts advising someone not to give out personal information for a promised free iPhone unless they received the iPhone *first*, as it is highly likely it would never materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

### The Evolution of Fraud
According to Marcelo, the kind of elaborate scams he pulled off in the past would be "unthinkable" today due to [[impact_of_technology|technological advancements]] and readily available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>. For example, claiming to be the son of the owner of Gol airlines would be immediately debunked by a quick internet search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. He also notes that obtaining a fake passport or forged documents is significantly more complicated now than it was in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

### Aviation and Automation
Marcelo also points out a specific instance related to [[effect_of_technology_in_healthcare|aviation]] where technology played a role in an accident. He was consulted about a plane crash involving Mariana Caltabiano's relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. While in jail, he studied aviation and had access to the black box transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. He understood that the Airbus model had a "Fly Direct" problem, where pilots become "hostages to automation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This means the equipment misinterprets actions, leading to errors. In this particular accident, the automation misunderstood a climb as a descent, activating the reverse gear, leading to the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. He argues that often, in such accidents, blame is incorrectly placed on the pilot rather than on machine problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

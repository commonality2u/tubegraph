Historically, [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spirituality]] and science were not separate disciplines. Ancient civilizations and thinkers often integrated these fields, viewing the world through a lens that combined empirical observation with [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | mystical]] understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. This contrasts sharply with modern perceptions, which largely see them as distinct, if not opposing, realms.

## Historical Intertwining

In ancient times, there was no division between science and [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. Science, in fact, originated from what is now referred to as [[Mythology and Spirituality | occultism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

> [!info] Occultism: Hidden Knowledge
> The term "occultism" does not inherently refer to dark or evil practices. It signifies "hidden" knowledge, an esoteric story intended for those initiated, as opposed to "exoteric" knowledge, which is for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Many works of media and pop culture are filled with such hidden references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

Notable historical figures who were deeply involved in both science and [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spirituality]] include:
*   **Paracelsus:** One of the fathers of modern medicine, who was also an alchemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. The symbol of medicine, the Caduceus, reflects ancient [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spiritual]] currents like the Ida and Pingala of Eastern yoga, and the staff of Hermes Trismegistus, representing Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Isaac Newton:** A Rosicrucian and Freemason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison:** Also initiates in various [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spiritual]] traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.

These individuals sought inspiration and knowledge from kabbalistic and hermetic references, believing in a world connected to ours, which Plato called the "plane of ideas" or "astral plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. Creative individuals often have a sensitivity to this archetypal plane, allowing them to materialize ideas from the astral into the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>.

## The Modern Disconnect

The separation between science and [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spirituality]] largely occurred due to the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. Initially, [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spiritual]] practices were open and normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. However, with the rise of the Catholic Church, these practices were repressed and termed "occult," meaning hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:05">[01:54:05]</a>. The Church, which began as a Roman institution under the Vespasian family and later Constantine, intentionally forged many concepts and appropriated [[mythology_and_spirituality | archetypes]] and mythologies from pagan traditions to establish its narrative and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

> [!example] Religious Misinterpretations
> *   **Papal Mitre:** This hat, worn by the Pope, originates from the Philistine priests of the dragon god Dagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:01">[01:5:01]</a>.
> *   **Satan:** In the oldest Hebrew biblical texts, "Satan" (lessat√£) simply means "opponent" or "adversary," not a personified entity of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. It refers to an angel of God, or even King David himself, in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The concept of Satan as an entity of evil and an enemy of God emerged later, influenced by dualistic Zoroastrian doctrines during the Babylonian exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
> *   **Lucifer:** The name "Lucifer" is not in the Bible as a demon. It appears in the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 14, as an epithet, referring to Venus, the Morning Star, and used as a metaphor for the proud King Nebuchadnezzar's fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. "Lucifer" (Latin for "light-bearer") was a Greco-Roman deity, the son of Aurora, associated with love, passion, and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
> *   **Demons:** The word "demon" (daimon) comes from Greek philosophy, referring to intelligent spirits or elementals of nature, both good and bad, that influenced human feelings and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The Catholic Church demonized these figures, associating them with evil and adopting pagan symbols like the Faun or Satyr with horns and tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
> *   **Jesus:** The historical Jesus, according to the speaker, was a wise man, an initiated Kabbalist, who achieved a state of "Christ" (anointed one, meaning one who has attained gnosis or knowledge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. His teachings, like "you only go to the Father through me," are metaphorical, referring to achieving inner balance and wisdom through his example, not through personal worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The New Testament is considered by the speaker to be a very flawed translation and organization of texts, influenced by the Nicene Council to create a "docile Christ" for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## The Universe, Archetypes, and Magic

The universe is an order forged within primordial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. [[Mythology and Spirituality | Mythology]] often uses [[mythology_and_spirituality | archetypes]] to explain natural forces, personifying them as deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. For example, Yemanja, the goddess of the sea, symbolizes life emerging from water, a concept consistent with science's understanding of the origin of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Magic and the Unconscious

Magic, in this context, is not supernatural but a process of influencing reality through the unconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   The **unconscious mind** is chaotic and works through symbols, not logical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:07">[02:14:07]</a>.
*   **Magic rituals** involve symbolic elements (candles for fire, chalice for water, circles, triangles) that communicate with the unconscious, rearranging internal symbols and meanings to emanate energy and transform reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Sigils** are symbols created by a magician to draw strengths and archetypes from their own unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

> [!quote] The Unconscious Mind
> "Who does the magic? Our unconscious. And our unconscious is symbolic. Then the magic ritual is messing with your unconscious to rearrange your symbols, your meaning, and emanate this energy from a form much more potential than you stay at home just thinking about things that the magic ritual will not work. That's it, he deals with archetypal symbols of the unconscious..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:56">[02:13:56]</a>

## The Age of Aquarius: Reintegrating Science and Spirituality

The current era, the Age of Aquarius, signifies a union of [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | spirituality]] with science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This contrasts with previous "Aions" or ages:
1.  **Age of Isis (Paleolithic):** Governed by matriarchal societies and the worship of nature and the feminine as divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Age of Osiris (Neolithic):** Marked by patriarchal systems, private property, and the worship of a reborn male God who is sacrificed and resurrected (symbolized by the sun's daily cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Age of Horus (Aquarius):** The current era, characterized by the integration of [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | spirituality]] and science, the fall of taboos (e.g., sexual repression), and the assertion of individual authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. In this age, individuals seek God within themselves, understanding that the divine energy is internal, adhering to the Hermetic principle: "as above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

> [!quote] Inner Divinity
> "...if there is any place I'll find him, it's inside of me, it's not out in the mouth of the other. I just find what belongs to the other, and what belongs to me, I need to find within myself. Then, the figure of the Aion of Horus is that each one will find God within of yourself in your own way and you will understand this aspect of [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | spirituality]] as a part that works with all things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>

Modern artists and cultural figures often integrate occult and [[impact_of_spirituality_on_life | spiritual]] symbols into their [[music_and_spirituality | work]], reflecting this shift towards a new age and understanding of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. These artists, sometimes inspired by occult societies like the Golden Dawn, use symbols to tap into creative potential and promote a vision of a reinvented world, not its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:16">[02:43:16]</a>.

## Conclusion: Balance and Evolution

Regardless of one's religious affiliation or lack thereof, everyone seeks [[spirituality_and_personal_growth | balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>. [[importance_of_mindfulness_and_spirituality | Spirituality]] is ultimately the pursuit of this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:27">[02:29:27]</a>. This era emphasizes that while life brings chaotic elements and challenges, these are opportunities for evolution and self-confrontation rather than external blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. True wisdom involves dealing with one's "shadows"‚Äîinternal traumas and negative aspects‚Äîto achieve communion with one's inner [[relationship_between_body_soul_and_spirit | spirit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:02">[02:28:02]</a>.

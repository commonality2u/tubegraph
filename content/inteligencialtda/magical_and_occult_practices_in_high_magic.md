[[history_of_occultism_and_spiritual_beliefs | Magical and occult practices]], particularly within the realm of "high magic," are portrayed as existing forces that can influence reality and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The effectiveness of magic, however, is believed to be contingent on a person's spiritual state and God's allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Spells and Curses

Spells and curses are described as energetic forces that require a "host" or "landing" to take effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. A curse without a "cause" — meaning a spiritual vulnerability or "gap" in a person's "armor" (spiritual protection) — will not land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. These "holes" in spiritual protection are associated with negative human traits such as pride, arrogance, greed, lying, envy, and other "toxic" feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

Magical harm can be inflicted intentionally or unintentionally, as simply wishing ill upon another person can produce negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. This negative energy can manifest as someone feeling unwell, depressed, or even experiencing minor accidents, which is often referred to as an "evil eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. If a person is vibrating on the "same wave frequency" as the negative energy, they are more susceptible to receiving harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

### Sources of Power

The power behind high magic comes from alliances and pacts made with "entities" or "demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. These pacts grant specific powers, often presented as enticing propositions like wealth, influence, or fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>.

These entities are believed to drain the vital energy of human beings, using it to elaborate spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. The power of these entities can also be used to cause biological alterations by compromising or deforming DNA through their "energy" when carrying germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

## Brotherhood of High Magic

The "Brotherhood of High Magic" is described as a powerful, elitist, and secretive group with "tentacles in every place in our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:00">[39:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>. They are said to operate within various organizations, such as Freemasonry, which they use as an "arm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>. Not all Freemasons are Satanists, but those reaching higher degrees may be introduced to the Brotherhood's true objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>.

The Brotherhood's ultimate goal is to "prepare the world," creating a "global platform for the government of the Antichrist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:47:00">[52:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>. Members are said to be intelligent and aware of God's greater power, yet they choose to align with evil, believing they can survive the coming apocalypse by hiding in underground bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

Initiation into such groups often involves giving one's blood as a promise or pact, as blood is seen as vital energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:01:08">[2:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:03:00">[2:03:00]</a>. The choice of individuals for the Brotherhood is based on "Kabbalistic numerological traits and astrological blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:04:13">[2:04:13]</a>.

## Historical Figures and Practices

[[depictions_of_demons_satanism_and_magic_in_historical_texts | High magic]] practices are said to date back to the Mesopotamian era, involving Sumerians, Akkadians, Egyptians, Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:29:00">[52:29:00]</a>. These ancient civilizations built pyramidal structures, like ziggurats, designed to channel large amounts of energy and serve as ritualistic environments where entities could materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:24:00">[51:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.

Notable figures in the history of magic include:
*   **Solomon**: Reputed to have learned rituals to dominate demons, imprisoning 72 of them in a bronze vessel, and wrote books like "The Greater and Lesser Clavicles of Solomon" which guide high magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:03:00">[47:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:00">[48:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:53:00">[48:53:00]</a>.
*   **Merlin**: A wizard associated with King Arthur, whose name is sometimes used in magical contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a>.
*   **Rasputin**: Described as a mix of priest and wizard, possessing fantastic powers of persuasion and influencing the last Romanovs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:00">[49:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>. He reportedly stopped a hemophiliac boy's bleeding over the phone through enchantment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>.
*   **Aleister Crowley**: A very famous Satanist and "great wizard," whose books like "The Book of the Law" (Thelema) are references in high witchcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:24:00">[52:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>.

## Rituals and Symbols

[[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | Rituals]] in high magic are precise, involving specific measurements, proportions, and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. Magicians use "magic circles" with symbols, and sometimes salt and water, as protection against aggressive entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[56:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:38:00">[56:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. Entities are believed to respect these symbols, similar to how people respect a stop sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:02:00">[57:02:00]</a>.

Specific symbols and their uses:
*   **Pentagram**: A five-pointed star representing a goat (with two points up), symbolizing freedom and control over the five continents in high magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:20:32">[3:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:20:34">[3:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:20:54">[3:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:20:56">[3:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:20:58">[3:20:58]</a>. It is used for "external attacks" to cause physical harm or accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:19">[3:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:22">[3:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:24">[3:21:24]</a>.
*   **Hexagram**: An older symbol, often used for attacks on the human psyche, causing demotivation, depression, or loss of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:30">[3:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:32">[3:21:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:41">[3:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:44">[3:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:21:47">[3:21:47]</a>.
*   **Languages**: Spells often require recitation in specific languages, such as Aramaic or Enochian (believed to be the language angels taught humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:22:21">[3:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:22:24">[3:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:22:26">[3:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:22:39">[3:22:39]</a>.

### Adrenochrome and Child Sacrifice

A dark theory mentioned within high magic circles is the use of adrenochrome, a substance believed to slow aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:05:49">[2:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:05:51">[2:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:01">[2:06:01]</a>. This substance is theorized to be produced from children placed in extreme fear and terror, releasing high levels of adrenaline before death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:44">[2:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:46">[2:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:50">[2:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:06:52">[2:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:07:09">[2:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:07:11">[2:07:11]</a>. The practice of child sacrifice is alleged to occur in some sects, reminiscent of ancient Aztec practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:08:02">[2:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:08:04">[2:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:08:11">[2:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:08:14">[2:08:14]</a>.

## Spiritual Warfare

[[spiritual_warfare_and_protective_practices | Spiritual warfare]] is depicted as a constant reality, with angels and demons actively engaging in battles for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. The Bible is cited as stating that a thousand may fall on one side and ten thousand on the other, but a person walking in God's will need not fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

Prayer is considered a powerful tool, particularly when spoken aloud, as demons cannot read minds but can hear verbalized words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>. The "sword of the spirit" is identified as the word of God, which must be verbalized to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>. Anointing oil is also presented as a powerful tool in spiritual battles, capable of breaking yokes and acting as a "perfume of God" due to its divine recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:36">[01:47:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:39">[01:47:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>.

### Exorcism

[[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | Demonic possession]] is a rare phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>. True demonic possession involves visible physical manifestations, such as contorting the body in ways that defy physics, changes in voice, and facial muscle distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:11">[01:52:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a>. Demons in possession can also exert brutal force beyond human explanation, drawing energy from the host's body to enhance their strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. Demons perceive fear and gain advantage when a person is afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:20">[01:47:20]</a>.

## Occult Influences in Modern Society

[[influence_of_the_supernatural_in_everyday_life | Occult beliefs]] are said to influence modern society through various means:
*   **Political figures**: Political agents may be "consecrated" to Satan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Architecture**: Cities like Brasília are said to be copies of ancient Egyptian cities (e.g., Akhetaton), designed with occult knowledge to absorb "cosmic and telluric energy" at energy vortexes, potentially influencing the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:50">[03:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:53">[03:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:04">[03:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:07">[03:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:10">[03:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:13">[03:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:16">[03:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:19">[03:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:21">[03:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:24">[03:03:24]</a>.
*   **Mass Media and Entertainment**: [[influence_of_esoteric_concepts_in_pop_culture | Satanic doctrines]] can be spread through subliminal messages in songs played backward, suggesting influence in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:29">[03:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:31">[03:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:35">[03:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>. Music producers can also make pacts that unknowingly implicate artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:29:27">[3:29:27]</a>.

## Entities and Spiritual Beings

Satan is described as Lucifer, a beautiful angel who became envious of God and was expelled from heaven, dragging one-third of the angels with him to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:21">[02:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:24">[02:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:03">[02:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:06">[02:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:41">[02:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:48">[02:28:48]</a>. The angels who fell with him became demons and are now confined to the earthly dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:45">[02:29:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>.

Demons are hierarchical, with "princes" controlling specific territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

Brazil has a rich history of [[UFO Phenomena | UFO phenomena]] and unexplained events, with numerous documented cases and official investigations spanning decades. The country has been a hotbed for [[UFO sightings and abductions | sightings, abductions]], and even physical interactions with unidentified objects and beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

## Historical Cases and Early Mentions

[[UFOs in Brazilian history | Historical UFO cases]] in Brazil predate the modern era of "flying saucers" (post-1947) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

*   **Minas Gerais Light (1939)**: A mysterious luminous ball was observed by over two thousand people in São João del Rei, Minas Gerais, making "evolutions like a drone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>.
*   **First Alleged Abduction (1931)**: The first reported abduction in Brazil involved Mr. José Florence in Campinas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. Researcher Edson observed drawings made by Florence of the creature that abducted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Indigenous Accounts**: Accounts from Brazilian indigenous peoples, such as the Kayapó tribe, describe encounters with beings from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. One tribe in Mato Grosso even reportedly captured and "ate" extraterrestrial beings described as "white beings, kind of weird" after they started interfering with tribal children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. Another Kayapó legend speaks of a "God Bep-Kororoti" who arrived in a "bard in thunder," had a weapon that disintegrated trees, and later married a tribal chief's daughter before leaving with his family in a "ship" to the stars, promising to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Notable Brazilian UFO Cases

### Night of the UFOs (1986)

On May 19, 1986, Brazil experienced an unprecedented wave of [[UFO sightings and abductions | UFO sightings]], dubbed the "Official Night of the UFOs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   More than 20 unidentified flying objects were detected by radar and observed visually in the skies over São Paulo, São José dos Campos, and Rio de Janeiro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.
*   Brigadier Otávio Júlio Moreira Lima of the Brazilian Air Force communicated with President José Sarney, authorizing interceptor aircraft (F-5s) to pursue these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>.
*   Pilots engaged in pursuits, and the radar systems were saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.
*   A collective sighting by over two thousand military personnel, including sergeants and officers, occurred at the Aeronautics Specialist School in Guaratinguetá, where a blackout also took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>.
*   Audios of the interceptions are available at the National Archive in Brasília <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>.
*   Brazilian Aeronautics officially recognized the phenomenon, giving interviews and press conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   The Brazilian government even communicated with the North American Department of Defense about the incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>.
*   Ozires Silva, former president of Embraer, observed an object in São José dos Campos while flying an Xingu aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:55">[03:07:55]</a>.
*   The phenomena lasted for ten days, with a "mother ship" reportedly collecting smaller objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>. These objects then moved towards Santos, eventually disappearing into an "elongated cigar-shaped" formation over the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>.
*   The Uruguayan government also requested details as objects crossed their border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:39">[03:34:39]</a>.

### [[varginha_ufo_incident_and_government_coverups | Varginha UFO Incident]] (1996)

One of Brazil's most famous and controversial cases, occurring in Varginha, Minas Gerais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   Multiple creatures were reportedly captured, leading to a significant military cover-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   The creatures are classified as "Gamma" type beings: thin, pale, with big eyes, no thumbs, three fingers, and two toes, and sometimes a "little hat" or small bumps on their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. One soldier who captured a creature drew it for researchers, describing it as "dark brown with red eyes and horns," about 1.60m tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   A group of 17 researchers, including Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues and Vitório Pacaccini, had unrestricted access to material and testimonies from military personnel, police, firefighters, and civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Creatures (one dead, one alive) were transported from an army installation (ESA) to Unicamp University, with 22 people involved, including Dr. Badal Palhares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   Two nurses and Dr. Palhares himself initially confirmed seeing the creature, though Palhares now denies everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   The case sparked rumors of US involvement, with Americans reportedly taking one creature, while another remained in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   A military policeman, Marco Eli Chereze, who captured an ET with bare hands, later died from an infection caused by a scratch under his armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. A statue in Varginha commemorates him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   The military's cover-up included intimidating witnesses and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. They attempted to deflect the sightings by claiming the creature was actually a mentally challenged mute individual known to crouch on curbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This claim was disproven by the girls who saw the ET and by the mute's confirmed presence at a school party at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   Witnesses, including the mother of two girls who saw the creature, were offered bribes by "men in black" to deny their sightings on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. They refused, valuing the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

### Operation Prato (1977)

A Brazilian Air Force operation in Belém do Pará to investigate attacks by luminous objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.
*   Known as the "Chupa-Chupa" or "Lollipop" phenomenon, witnesses reported lights that targeted them, sucking blood and bodily fluids, leaving marks like needle punctures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   The mission was coordinated by Captain Uyrangê Hollanda, who later committed suicide after revealing details of the secret operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   Over 500 photographs and cinematographic records were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.
*   The phenomenon caused widespread panic, leading to people seeking medical attention for their injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
*   The phenomenon migrated from Maranhão, through several cities in Pará, to the Amazon, and by the end of 1984, crossed into Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.
*   Similar attacks on indigenous people occurred in Acre between 2014-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Pedro de Toledo Case (1994)

Occurred in February 1994, involving José Marlone, a site foreman in Pedro de Toledo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   Marlone was struck by a light inside his locked house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

*   No smell of putrefaction was present. Police, alerted by missing persons reports, found him dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   The police investigation was inconclusive, classifying the death as "undetermined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   The death certificate was also reportedly missing or altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   The case also involved an alleged fugitive status of Marlone, who had committed homicide in Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Araçariguama Case ("Man Who Melted") (1946)

In February 1946, João Prestes Jr. was hit by a light while fishing during Carnival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   His body felt like it was burning, and he suffered burns in exposed areas. His skin began to peel off, primarily on his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   He experienced no pain, and his joints became loose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   He died en route to the hospital, covered in sheets because his skin was falling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Ubatuba UFO Explosion (1957)

A well-known case where a UFO allegedly exploded over Toninhas Beach in Ubatuba, São Paulo, in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   Fragments of the object were recovered and analyzed, found to be composed of 99.3% pure magnesium, which is highly unusual for terrestrial materials or meteorites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   NASA and Stanford University have reportedly studied these fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   The case was widely publicized in newspapers like *O Globo* and magazines like *O Cruzeiro* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Lead Mask Case (1966)

Two electronics technicians were found dead on Vintém Hill in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   They were wearing lead masks and had a bottle of magnesium water and notes with instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   A UFO was reportedly sighted by a family in the area around the time of their deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   The area where their bodies were found remains barren, with no bush growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   The police investigation was inconclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Ilha do Meio Woman Case (Operation Prato related)

During Operation Prato, a mysterious blonde woman named Elizabeth Bergeron bought all houses on Ilha do Meio (also called Ilha do Cajueiro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   Curiously, [[UFO Phenomena | luminous phenomena]] appeared frequently around the island when she was there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   She purchased large quantities of fish weekly (200-400 kg), leading to speculation about her purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   She was questioned by civil and federal police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   The Air Force captain leading Operation Prato even interviewed her, suspecting she might be feeding "warriors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   She was described as "hip" and dressed strangely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Her husband, who is still alive, does not wish to speak about the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## UFO Incidence by Region in Brazil

Certain regions in Brazil show a higher incidence of [[UFO sightings and abductions | UFO sightings]]:
*   **Coastline**: The entire Brazilian coast has a high incidence, suggesting the possible existence of strategic underwater bases for these unidentified objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

*   **South of Minas Gerais**: This region is "very rich in casuistry," including Três Corações, Varginha, Aiuruoca, and São Thomé das Letras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. A recent UFO landing case was reported in Três Corações in January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon Region**: Cases in Manaus often involve a significant number of witnesses, but the most striking are attack cases, including the "Chupa-Chupa" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Ribeira Valley (Iporanga)**: Many cases since the 1940s, with residents reporting luminous phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Serra da Beleza (Rio de Janeiro)**: A "well-suited region for the phenomenon" that has been photographed and described in books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Goiás (Alexânia, Pirenópolis, Formosa)**: Formosa has petroglyphs (ancient indigenous markings) depicting shapes resembling "bicycle wheels" or flying saucers, suggesting past sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Government and Military Involvement

The Brazilian government and military have had a complex history with the [[UFO Phenomena | UFO phenomenon]], often characterized by secrecy and cover-ups.
*   **Official Investigations**:
    *   From 1968 to 1974, the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) established an official body to investigate [[UFO Phenomena | UFO phenomena]] using scientific methodology, generating several reports with detailed data and witness examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
    *   The Aeronautical Command and Military Police have also conducted investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Cover-ups and Secrecy**:
    *   The military often covers up UFO incidents to prevent widespread panic and to potentially study captured technology for reverse engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
    *   Documents related to UFOs are often moved to "parallel files" to avoid public access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   Presidents are typically informed about [[Ufology and extraterrestrial life | ufological cases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   The "Official Night of the UFOs" in 1986 saw military acknowledgment, but many other cases remain classified or denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   The [[varginha_ufo_incident_and_government_coverups | Varginha UFO Incident]] was classified as "top secret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   Researchers investigating sensitive cases, like Varginha, have reported threats and intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Classification of [[UFO Phenomena | UFO Sightings]] and Beings

[[Ufology and extraterrestrial life | Ufology]] uses specific classifications for contacts and types of beings:
*   **Degrees of Contact** (instituted by J. Allen Hynek and expanded upon):
    *   **1st Degree**: Sighting of lights or objects in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
    *   **2nd Degree**: Physical trace evidence, such as marks on the ground, electromagnetic interference, animal mutilations, or burns on human skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
    *   **3rd Degree**: Sighting of occupants or crew members, regardless of whether a UFO is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   **4th Degree**: [[UFO sightings and abductions | Abduction]], where a person is taken aboard a ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
    *   **5th Degree**: Communication or interaction, often telepathic, but sometimes in the local language of the abductee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Types of Beings**:
    *   **Alphas (Grays)**: Short (around 1.5m), with disproportionately large heads and big black eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. They are the most commonly reported abductors (around 80% of cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Betas**: Resemble humans, often described with "more beautiful features," blonde hair, and blue eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. They can be normal height or taller (up to 2.5 meters) and account for about 15% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Gammas**: Less common (5% of cases), these beings can have bodies covered in hair or robotic features. The creature from the [[varginha_ufo_incident_and_government_coverups | Varginha UFO Incident]] is classified as a Gamma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Chupacabra**: A phenomenon related to [[UFO Phenomena | ufology]] involving creatures that drain the blood and remove organs from animals, leaving cauterized wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## General Concepts and Theories in [[Ufology and extraterrestrial life | Ufology]]

*   **UFO vs. UAP**: The term "UAP" (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) is now preferred by some, including the US military, over "UFO" (Unidentified Flying Object) as it encompasses a broader range of phenomena not necessarily identified as objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.
*   **Abductions**: While less frequently reported publicly now, "dormitory visits" or sleep abductions still occur, where individuals are transported through walls or roofs onto ships while sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Tractor Beams**: Described as "solid light cones," these beams are reportedly used for kidnapping and are depicted in films like *Fire in the Sky* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Time Dilation**: Some cases suggest time passes differently inside UFOs, with witnesses experiencing short perceived times but having been missing for days, or vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Crop Circles**: While most are human-made by "cycle makers," some believe patterns formed by multiple objects landing could be authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Theories on Origin**:
    *   **Extraterrestrial**: Beings from other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Intraterrestrial**: Beings from within Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Interdimensional**: Beings from other dimensions or parallel universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Time Travelers**: Future humans visiting the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Explanation**: Many UFO sightings can be attributed to known objects like drones, satellites (e.g., Starlink), or weather balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Atmospheric phenomena, such as methane gas combustion near cemeteries, can also be mistaken for UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Ancient Astronaut Theory**: The idea that ancient civilizations were visited by [[Extraterrestrial life and UFO sightings | extraterrestrial life]], influencing their knowledge and culture. This is often linked to ancient structures like the Egyptian pyramids and Nazca Lines, though conventional explanations exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Ancient texts, like the Mahabharata, describe "vimanas" (flying machines), and Sumerian tablets mention trips into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## [[Historical and modern UFO investigations | Modern UFO Investigations]]

*   **Chilean Aeronautics**: Accused of covering up a metallic object sighting in 2018 by classifying it as a weather balloon, despite discrepancies in color, movement, and release times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Pentagon's Acknowledgment**: The Pentagon has released videos and documents related to unidentified aerial phenomena, but deliberately uses broad terms like "UAV" (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) rather than explicitly stating they are extraterrestrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Area 51**: A military area in Nevada widely believed to house crashed UFOs and extraterrestrial technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. While the US government has acknowledged its existence as a secret research site for military aircraft, its specific connection to UFOs remains officially unconfirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Bob Lazar, a controversial figure, claims to have worked with an unknown element (Element 115) from a captured UFO at Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

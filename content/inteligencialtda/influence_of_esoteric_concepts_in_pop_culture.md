From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The influence of esoteric and occult concepts is widely prevalent across various forms of popular culture, from music to comics and film, often without explicit recognition or understanding by mainstream audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This presence often stems from artists and creators drawing upon hidden or "occult" knowledge, which is "hidden" not because it is dark, but because it is esoteric and not for public consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Music and Occultism

Many musical artists and bands, both classic and contemporary, have incorporated esoteric concepts into their work:

*   **The Beatles**: Despite common misconceptions, The Beatles were not "satanic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. However, they were influenced by occultism, particularly through figures like [[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | Aleister Crowley]], who appears on the cover of their *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:47">[02:24:47]</a>. John Lennon, in particular, admired Crowley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>.
*   **Led Zeppelin**: This band had a significant connection to occultism, especially guitarist Jimmy Page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a>. Page purchased [[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | Aleister Crowley]]'s Boleskine House, a mansion known for its occult associations, and performed a "coronation rite" for Led Zeppelin there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:18">[02:26:18]</a>. The band's four famous symbols are derived from esoteric texts and astrological associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:02">[02:37:02]</a>. For example, Jimmy Page's symbol is an astrological symbol of Saturn, found in esoteric books like *Dragon Rouge* and *Infernal Dictionary* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:09">[02:37:09]</a>. Robert Plant's feather symbol (Ma'at) represents lightness of heart from ancient Egyptian traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:44">[02:38:44]</a>.
    *   Despite their success, the band members experienced personal tragedies, which some attribute to their dabbling in powerful energies without full preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:04">[02:36:04]</a>. John Bonham's symbol, three intertwined circles, found on Ballantine's beer, when inverted, was associated with his tragic death by drowning due to alcoholism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:30">[02:39:30]</a>.
*   **The Rolling Stones**: Like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones were influenced by occultists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. Keith Richards' longevity is jokingly attributed to his knowledge of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.
*   **Iron Maiden**: Bruce Dickinson, the band's vocalist, is a profound connoisseur of esoteric subjects, having even written a film about [[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | Aleister Crowley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Their album covers, like *The Best of 2001*, feature sigils (magical symbols) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:59">[02:41:59]</a>.
*   **Pop Artists (Madonna, Katy Perry, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Matuê, Gloria Groove, Pabllo Vittar)**: Many contemporary pop artists incorporate esoteric symbols and themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>.
    *   Madonna explicitly discusses occult themes in her song "Illuminati," stating they are "reinventing the world" for a "new world" and "new age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:09">[02:43:09]</a>.
    *   Katy Perry's "Dark Horse" music video features the "Eye of Horus" or "Eye of Providence," a strong symbol associated with the [[Influence of Illuminati and conspiracy theories | Illuminati]], [[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Freemasonry]], Golden Dawn, and Rosicrucian societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>.
    *   Artists like Jay-Z and Rihanna are linked to societies like the A∴A∴ (Astron Argentinum) and Golden Dawn, and use specific hand signs in their performances, such as the "Tom-Ash-Nate" sign, symbolizing a degree in hermetic mysticism associated with creativity and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>.
    *   Matuê's songs include numerological references like "777" and "666," alluding to Thelemic rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28">[02:17:28]</a>.
    *   Gloria Groove and Pabllo Vittar's music videos and profiles feature symbols like the crescent moon and cross, derived from John Dee's *Monas Hieroglyphica*, a 16th-century alchemical text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pacts in Music
> The idea of musicians making "pacts with the devil" is a common misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:45">[02:15:45]</a>. In esoteric understanding, "pact" refers to a spiritual agreement with entities to gain beneficial influence, such as success or prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:45">[02:16:45]</a>. Anitta, for example, is associated with Candomblé and has had her head given to Oxum, an orisha related to the arts, which is seen as a spiritual agreement, not a "deal with the devil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:12">[02:17:12]</a>.

## Comics and Esoteric Influence

Comic book writers have also deeply integrated esoteric concepts into their narratives:

*   **Alan Moore**: Described as a Thelemite and initiated into a school of occultism, Alan Moore transposes his esoteric knowledge directly into his works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. His graphic novel *V for Vendetta* explores Chaos Theory and societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Moore's works, including *Watchmen* and *From Hell* (about Jack the Ripper), are filled with occultism and Thelemic references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. They often contain "esoteric messages" as a "code for those who are initiated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Grant Morrison**: Another comic book writer, Morrison delves further into [[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Chaos Magic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Many comic book creators are occultists, influenced by figures like Austin Osman Spare, whose *Psychonaut* is a foundational text for [[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Chaos Magic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Esoteric Concepts in Other Media

Beyond music and comics, esoteric concepts appear in various other forms of media:

*   **Film (Avatar, Star Wars)**:
    *   The film *Avatar* embodies the concept of Gaia, where the planet is a single, living energy called Pandora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
    *   *Star Wars* draws from esoteric ideas, particularly the "betrayal of Order 66" which is directly inspired by the historical annihilation of the Knights Templar by the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47">[02:01:47]</a>. The concept of the "Force" and its "dark side" echoes the dualistic principles found in some esoteric traditions.
*   **Cartoons/Anime (Disney, Naruto, Dragon Ball)**:
    *   **Disney cartoons**: Many classic Disney cartoons, particularly *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, are rich in Kabbalistic symbolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:31">[03:05:31]</a>. The seven dwarfs can represent the seven vices, seven virtues, seven main planets, seven chakras, or other septenary systems found in Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>. Walt Disney himself was a high-degree Freemason (33rd degree) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:32">[03:07:32]</a>, and the 33 vertebrae in the spine symbolize the path from lower to enlightened consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:36">[03:08:36]</a>.
    *   **Naruto**: The anime *Naruto* depicts the protagonist's relationship with the Kyubi (a demon beast), which can be seen as an allegory for a wizard's journey to master their "inner beast" or unconscious desires and use them for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. Naruto's "Sage of Six Paths" power also alludes to Kabbalistic numerology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:09">[03:04:09]</a>.
*   **Games (RPG, Yu-Gi-Oh)**: RPGs and card games like *Yu-Gi-Oh* also contain many occult elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:58">[03:08:58]</a>. The speaker asserts that such elements are not inherently "devilish" but rather draw from existing symbolic and archetypal traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:03">[03:09:03]</a>.

## Key Esoteric Concepts Explained

### Occultism vs. Evil
The term "occultism" simply means "hidden" or "veiled," referring to knowledge not immediately obvious or accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It does not inherently imply "dark" or "evil" practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The modern association of occultism with evil figures like "Satan" or "Lucifer" is largely due to misinterpretations and deliberate distortions by institutions like the Catholic Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>.

### Chaos Magic
[[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Chaos Magic]] is a system where individuals create their own magical practices rather than adhering strictly to orthodox traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. It allows for mixing elements from different esoteric currents and impregnating objects with one's own energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Sigils, personal magical symbols drawn from the unconscious, are a key component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Archetypes and the Unconscious
According to Carl Jung, the unconscious and subconscious are populated by archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Magicians filter these archetypes to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Our unconscious influences our actions and creates our reality, and it communicates through symbols, not logical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>. Magical rituals are essentially a way to rearrange the symbols and meanings within the unconscious to manifest desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:03">[02:14:03]</a>.

### Demystifying Satan, Devil, and Lucifer
The concepts of "Satan," "Devil," and "Lucifer" as malevolent entities are largely products of later biblical translations and interpretations, not their original meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>.

*   **Satan**: In the oldest Hebrew Bible (Pentateuch), "Satan" first appears in the book of Numbers 22:22 and simply means "opponent" or "adversary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. For example, an angel of God was placed as a "Satan" (opponent) to Balaam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. David was also referred to as a "Satan" (adversary) by the Philistines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:41">[02:26:41]</a>. The idea of Satan as an enemy of God with evil intent developed later, specifically after the Babylonian exile when Jews encountered Zoroastrianism's dualistic doctrine of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>.
*   **Demon**: This word originates from the Greek "Daimon," referring to intelligent spirits or genii of nature (e.g., spirits of fire, water, earth, air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. Socrates spoke of his "Daimon" inspiring him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:26">[02:48:26]</a>. "Caco Daimons" were negative spirits, but even these were understood to serve a necessary evolutionary purpose, like wars or depression, which can lead to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>. The Catholic Church later demonized these figures, taking symbols like the satyr or Pan and associating them with evil to control the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.
*   **Lucifer**: The name "Lucifer" appears only once in the Old Testament, in the book of Isaiah 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. It is an epithet, referring to the "Morning Star" (planet Venus), and used metaphorically to describe the fall of the proud King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Venus was seen as "expelled from heaven" due to its cycle, and this was likened to the king's arrogance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. Saint Jerome's Latin translation (Vulgate) misinterpreted "Morning Star" as the proper name "Lucifer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. In Greco-Roman paganism, "Luxiferos" (light-bearer) was a deity representing Venus, associated with love, beauty, and seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The Daniel Mastral Controversy
> The speaker strongly refutes claims made by Daniel Mastral regarding Satanism and secret societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:03">[03:12:03]</a>. Mastral, accused of lacking cognitive and intellectual competence for such subjects, is described as misleading people for profit by fabricating "satanic terror" and "deceiving people using their faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:45">[03:12:45]</a>. The speaker asserts that true Luciferianism and Satanism, based on Kabbalistic principles and the "left-hand path," do not involve human sacrifices or similar heinous crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:08">[03:13:08]</a>.

### The Ages (Aions)
The concept of "time" in the New Testament is often a mistranslation of the Greek "aion," meaning "era" or "age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:19">[02:27:19]</a>. This refers to astrological ages that shape human consciousness and spirituality.
*   **Age of Isis (Paleolithic/Matriarchal)**: Marked by the worship of feminine divinity and nature, with priestesses (matriarchs) leading religious practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:52">[02:45:52]</a>.
*   **Age of Osiris (Patriarchal)**: Began with the settlement of humanity and the rise of private property, leading to patriarchal societies and the worship of male, reborn, sacrificed deities like Osiris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:18">[02:47:18]</a>. It is marked by religious conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>.
*   **Age of Horus (Aquarius)**: The current age, marked by the union of spirituality and science, a breaking of taboos, and a focus on finding inner divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:56">[02:48:56]</a>. It began with the reception of [[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | Aleister Crowley]]'s "Book of the Law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.

## Historical Figures and Occult Societies

Many historical figures, often linked to secret societies, played a role in the dissemination of esoteric knowledge that later influenced pop culture:

*   **Ancient Scientists/Philosophers**: Figures like Paracelsus (father of modern medicine), Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, and Thomas Edison were initiates in various occult traditions like Rosicrucianism and [[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Freemasonry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. They sought knowledge from "kabbalistic references of hermeticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.
*   **King Solomon**: Solomon is described as a great wizard who controlled "daimons" (geniuses of nature) through a system, potentially the Goetia, to build his temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>. His wisdom and control over these entities are documented in the Quran and Talmud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>. The number 666, often associated with evil, actually represents Solomon's wealth and is a Kabbalistic number (Tiphareth, the solar element, has the number 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>. The Hexagram (Star of David), with its six triangles, six points, and six angles, symbolizes balance between polarities (masculine/feminine, conscious/unconscious, light/darkness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:02">[01:47:02]</a>.
*   **Knights Templar**: During the Crusades, nine knights received permission from the Catholic Church to occupy the former site of Solomon's Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. After years of excavation, they reportedly found significant treasures, including grimoires (magic books) and ancient wisdom texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. This discovery led to their sudden rise in power and wealth, forming the first banks and receiving unprecedented liberties from the Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>. They were later persecuted and annihilated, with their last ship supposedly carrying the Holy Grail, the Merovingian lineage, or other secrets to Scotland, where [[Magical and occult practices in high magic | Freemasonry]] later began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **John Dee**: A 16th-century mathematician and alchemist, John Dee was the spiritual advisor and astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, deeply influencing the British royal family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>. He developed the Enochian language to communicate with "angels" (astral beings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:50">[02:56:50]</a>. His coronation ritual for the British Empire in Mortlake Park aimed to establish it as the world's largest through magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. His instruments and literature are preserved in the British Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>.
*   **[[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | Aleister Crowley]]**: An influential occultist, Crowley created his own orders (O.T.O., A∴A∴) after disputes with the Golden Dawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:58">[02:25:58]</a>. He performed the "Abramelin ritual" at Boleskine House to commune with his Holy Guardian Angel and confront inner "demons" (shadows/traumas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a>. This ritual, essentially an acceleration of life's karmic processes, involved opening "infernal portals" (metaphorical access to the unconscious and its shadows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:10">[02:30:10]</a>. Crowley's legacy profoundly influenced rock and pop artists.

## Conclusion

The pervasive [[Analysis of religious and spiritual symbolism in popular music and media | influence of esoteric concepts in pop culture]] is a testament to creators drawing from [[Mythology and Spirituality | ancient mythology and spirituality]] and [[History of occultism and spiritual beliefs | occult traditions]]. These elements are often presented symbolically, inviting deeper interpretation beyond their surface-level appearance. Understanding the origins and meanings of these concepts can reveal a rich tapestry of human knowledge and spiritual exploration woven into the fabric of modern entertainment.
